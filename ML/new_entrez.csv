Changes in expression of breast cancer tumor biomarkers between primary tumors and corresponding metastatic sites: common patterns and relationships with survival.,"In metastatic breast cancer, differences in expression patterns of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) between the primary tumor (PT) and metastatic site (MET) have been reported. However, there is limited understanding of the relationship of tumor subtype discordance and overall survival (OS). We evaluated patterns of ER/PR/HER2 in PTs and corresponding METs and assessed the relationship between these patterns and OS. Patients diagnosed at our center with metastatic breast cancer (2011-2020) were included. ER/PR were stratified as < 1%/1-10%/ > 10% by immunohistochemistry and HER2 as positive/negative by immunohistochemistry/FISH. Tumor subtypes were classified as ER or PR + /HER2-, HER2+ , or triple-negative. Biomarker discordance data from PTs to METs were analyzed for expression patterns. OS was assessed. Of 254 patients, 41 (16.1%) had synchronous and 213 (83.9%) had metachronous METs. Category change of ER/PR/HER2 expression was observed in 56 (22.0%), 117 (40.5%), and 30 (11.8%) patients, respectively. Tumor subtype changed in 56 (22.0%) patients. We identified a difference between PT and MET from ER > 10% to ER < 1% (n = 28,16.2% p < 0.01); PR > 10% to PR < 1% (n = 54,48.2%, p < 0.001); PR > 10% to PR 1-10% (n = 18,16.1%, p < 0.001), and ER or PR+/HER2- to triple-negative (n = 19,13.0%, p = 0.03). In log-rank analysis, change from an ER or PR+/HER2- (5-year OS 88.6%) PT to a HER2+(67.5%) or triple-negative (54.6%) MET was associated with decreased survival (p < 0.01); however, in multivariate analysis, discordant biomarker expression was not associated with decreased survival (p > 0.05). Tumor expression of ER/PR/HER2 can differ between the PT and MET. Loss of ER/PR expression is common and may be related to worse survival. Routine assessment of MET tumor markers could inform prognosis and therapeutic decision-making.",['Schwieger L; Postlewait LM; Liu Y; Jou S; Yi S; Peng L; Li X'],2024,differences in expression patterns between primary tumor and metastatic site (MET) have been reported. there is limited understanding of the relationship between tumor subtype discordance and overall survival (OS)
"[Trends, challenges, and reflections on early-onset gastric cancer].","Early onset gastric cancer (EOGC), as a distinct type of gastric cancer, has seen a gradually increasing incidence in recent years, imposing significant negative impacts on society and families, and has attracted widespread attention. EOGC presents a series of clinical characteristics, such as a higher prevalence among women, pathological types predominantly being poorly differentiated or undifferentiated, and Lauren classification often being diffuse, making it more prone to distant metastasis. However, the causes and mechanisms of its onset are not yet fully understood. Notably, about 10% of EOGC cases exhibit familial clustering and germline mutations in the Cadherin-1 (CDH1) or α-1 catenin (CTNNA1) genes, known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). These unique clinical features pose significant challenges for the diagnosis and treatment of EOGC. The core of treatment for early onset gastric cancer focuses on strong efficacy, function preservation, rehabilitation, and social reintegration. Clinically, a multidisciplinary approach and comprehensive treatment are essential, with equal emphasis on physiological and psychological aspects, balancing therapeutic effectiveness with functional outcomes, to benefit more patients with EOGC.",['Wang XF; Sun YH'],2024,EOGC has seen a gradually increasing incidence in recent years. pathological types predominantly being poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. about 10% of EOGC cases exhibit familial clustering and germline mutations.
Benefit-finding profiles and comparison of caregiving ability among informal caregivers of patients with lung cancer: A latent profile analysis.,"This study aimed to explore the benefit finding (BF) profiles among informal caregivers of patients with lung cancer, identify demographic and disease characteristics, and analyze differences in caregiving ability between profiles. This cross-sectional study utilized convenience sampling to select 272 informal caregivers of patients with lung cancer from a tertiary care hospital in Guangzhou, China. The research instruments used included the Demographic and Disease Characteristics Questionnaire, the revised version of the BF Scale, and the Chinese version of the Family Caregiver Task Inventory. Data analysis was performed using latent profile analysis, chi-square test, Fisher's exact probability test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and multivariate logistic regression. (1) BF can be divided into three profiles: ""high benefit-family and personal growth"" (Profile 1, 7.7%), ""moderate benefit-unclear perception"" (Profile 2, 44.9%), and ""low benefit-coping ability deficient"" (Profile 3, 47.4%). (2) Having a cocaregiver and a disease duration of 6-12 months were more likely to belong to Profile 1; caregivers of patients aged 40-60 years tended to belong to Profile 2; caregivers of older patients with disease duration > 12 months and clinical stage II or III were more likely to belong to Profile 3. (3) There were significant differences in the total score of caregiving ability and the scores of each dimension among the different BF profiles (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and the caregiving abilities of Profile 1 and Profile 2 were higher than those of Profile 3. There was heterogeneity in BF among informal caregivers of patients with lung cancer. Healthcare professionals can identify the key profiles of lung-cancer caregivers based on characteristics such as age, clinical stage, disease duration, and cocaregiver status and enhance their caregiving ability through targeted nursing guidance.",['Lin X; Chen Z; Zhao Q; Zhou X'],2024,study aimed to explore benefit finding profiles among informal caregivers of patients with lung cancer. a cross-sectional study used convenience sampling to select 272 informal caregivers. a study used convenience sampling to select 272 informal caregivers of patients with lung cancer.
SCOUT® Radar Localization at Time of Breast Biopsy.,"Evaluate surgical utilization of SCOUT reflectors placed at breast biopsy. Consent was waived for this retrospective IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study. Breast biopsy examinations that reported the term ""SCOUT"" between January 2021 and June 2022 were identified using an institutional search engine. Cases were included if a SCOUT reflector was placed at time of breast biopsy and excluded if lesion pathology was already known. Analysis was performed at the lesion level. A multivariate-regression analysis evaluated 6 variables with potential impact on SCOUT utilization. One hundred twenty-one lesions in 112 patients met inclusion criteria. Biopsy yielded 93% (113/121) malignant, 3% (4/121) elevated risk, 2% (2/121) benign-discordant, and 2% (2/121) benign-concordant results. Two cases lost to follow-up were excluded. SCOUT reflectors were utilized for lumpectomy (58%, 69/119 lesions) and excisional biopsy (6%, 7/119 lesions). SCOUTs were not utilized due to mastectomy (23%, 27/119), subsequent wire localization (2%, 2/119), and nonsurgical cases (12%, 14/119). Reflector placement utilization was 52% higher for findings less than 3.5 cm in size (P <.001), 33% higher in patients without prior treated breast cancer (P = .012), and 19% higher in patients with no suspicious ipsilateral lymph node (P = .048). SCOUT reflector placement at time of biopsy was utilized for surgery 64% (76/119) of the time, although most (98%, 119/121) biopsies were malignant, elevated risk, or benign-discordant. Factors increasing reflector utilization include smaller lesion size, no suspicious ipsilateral lymph node, and no prior treated breast cancer.",['Dashevsky BZ; Muneer MS; Hao M; Liang T; Wapnir IL; Poplack SP'],2024,"biopsy examinations reported the term ""SCOUT"" between January 2021 and June 2022. a retrospective IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. a multivariate-regression analysis evaluated 6 variables with potential impact on SCOUT utilization."
Factors Associated with Patient Education in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) - A Primary Health Care Register-Based Study.,"Patient education in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is recommended in treatment strategy documents, since it can improve the ability to cope with the disease. Our aim was to identify the extent of and factors associated with patient education in patients with COPD in a primary health care setting. In this nationwide study, we identified 29,692 COPD patients with a registration in the Swedish National Airway Register (SNAR) in 2019. Data on patient education and other clinical variables of interest were collected from SNAR. The database was linked to additional national registers to obtain data about pharmacological treatment, exacerbations and educational level. Patient education had been received by 44% of COPD patients, 72% of whom had received education on pharmacological treatment including inhalation technique. A higher proportion of patients who had received education were offered smoking cessation support, had performed spirometry and answered the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), compared with patients without patient education. In the adjusted analysis, GOLD grade 2 (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.18-1.42), grade 3 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.27-1.57) and grade 4 (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-2.15), as well as GOLD group E (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29), ex-smoking (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.56-1.84) and current smoking (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.33-1.58) were positively associated with having received patient education, while cardiovascular disease (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) and diabetes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87-1.00) were negatively associated with receipt of patient education. Fewer than half of the patients had received patient education, and the education had mostly been given to those with more severe COPD, ex- and current smokers and patients with fewer comorbidities. Our study highlights the need to enhance patient education at an earlier stage of the disease.",['Lindh A; Giezeman M; Theander K; Zakrisson AB; Westerdahl E; Stridsman C'],2024,"a nationwide study identified 29,692 COPD patients with a registration in the Swedish national airway register (SNAR) in 2019. the database was linked to additional national registers to obtain data about pharmacological treatment, exacerbations and educational level."
"Prospective associations between breast feeding, metabolic health, inflammation and bone density in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus.","The aim of the study is to investigate prospective associations between breastfeeding and metabolic outcomes, inflammation, and bone density in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We prospectively included 171 women with GDM from the MySweetheart trial. Women were followed during pregnancy (from 24 up to 32 weeks' gestational age) up to 1 year postpartum. Outcomes included weight, weight retention, body composition, insulin resistance and secretion indices, C reactive protein (CRP), and bone density. We compared differences in the associations between breastfeeding and health outcomes between women who breast fed <6 months vs ≥6 months. Analyses were adjusted for potential medical and sociodemographic confounders. Breastfeeding initiation was 94.2% (n=161) and mean breastfeeding duration was 6.6 months. Breastfeeding duration was independently associated with lower weight, weight retention, body fat, visceral adipose tissue, lean mass, CRP, insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance), and insulin secretion (Homeostatic Model Assessment of β-cell index) at 1 year postpartum (all p≤0.04) after adjusting for confounders. Breastfeeding was associated with higher insulin resistance-adjusted insulin secretion (Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2) in the unadjusted analyses only. There was no association between breastfeeding duration and bone density. Compared with <6 months, breastfeeding duration ≥6 months was associated with lower weight, weight retention, body fat, fat-free mass as well as lower CRP at 1 year postpartum (all p<0.05) after adjusting for confounders. Longer breastfeeding duration among women with prior GDM was associated with lower insulin resistance, weight, weight retention, body fat and inflammation, but not lower bone density at 1 year postpartum. Breastfeeding for ≥6 months after GDM can help to improve cardiometabolic health outcomes 1 year after delivery.",['Hebeisen I; Gonzalez Rodriguez E; Arhab A; Gross J; Schenk S; Gilbert L; Benhalima K; Horsch A; Quansah DY; Puder JJ'],2024,prospectively included 171 women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus. women were followed during pregnancy (from 24 up to 32 weeks' gestational age) up to 1 year postpartum.
Refining Risk Stratification of High-risk and Locoregional Prostate Cancer: A Pooled Analysis of Randomized Trials.,"Radiotherapy (RT) and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ltADT; 18-36 mo) is a standard of care in the treatment of high-risk localized/locoregional prostate cancer (HRLPC). We evaluated the outcomes in patients treated with RT + ltADT to identify which patients have poorer prognosis with standard therapy. Individual patient data from patients with HRLPC (as defined by any of the following three risk factors [RFs] in the context of cN0 disease-Gleason score ≥8, cT3-4, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA] >20 ng/ml, or cN1 disease) treated with RT and ltADT in randomized controlled trials collated by the Intermediate Clinical Endpoints in Cancer of the Prostate group. The outcome measures of interest were metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), time to metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Multivariable Cox and Fine-Gray regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for the three RFs and cN1 disease. A total of 3604 patients from ten trials were evaluated, with a median PSA value of 24 ng/ml. Gleason score ≥8 (MFS HR = 1.45; OS HR = 1.42), cN1 disease (MFS HR = 1.86; OS HR = 1.77), cT3-4 disease (MFS HR = 1.28; OS HR = 1.22), and PSA >20 ng/ml (MFS HR = 1.30; OS HR = 1.21) were associated with poorer outcomes. Adjusted 5-yr MFS rates were 83% and 78%, and 10-yr MFS rates were 63% and 53% for patients with one and two to three RFs, respectively; corresponding 10-yr adjusted OS rates were 67% and 60%, respectively. In cN1 patients, adjusted 5- and 10-yr MFS rates were 67% and 36%, respectively, and 10-yr OS was 47%. HRLPC patients with two to three RFs (and cN0) or cN1 disease had the poorest outcomes on RT and ltADT. This will help in counseling patients treated in routine practice and in guiding adjuvant trials in HRLPC. Radiotherapy and long-term hormone therapy are standard treatments for high-risk and locoregional prostate cancer. In this report, we defined prognostic groups within high-risk/locoregional prostate cancer and showed that outcomes to standard therapy are poorest in those with two or more ""high-risk"" factors or evidence of lymph node involvement. Such patients may therefore be the best candidates for intensification of treatment.","[""Ravi P; Xie W; Buyse M; Halabi S; Kantoff PW; Sartor O; Attard G; Clarke N; D'Amico A; Dignam J; James N; Fizazi K; Gillessen S; Parulekar W; Sandler H; Spratt DE; Sydes MR; Tombal B; Williams S; Sweeney CJ""]",2024,RT and long-term androgen deprivation therapy is a standard of care in the treatment of high-risk localized/locoregional prostate cancer (HRLPC). ltADT is a standard of care in the treatment of high-risk localized/locoregional prostate cancer (HRLPC)
Transition probabilities of diabetic retinopathy and death in an Asian population with Diabetes.,"To evaluate the dynamic transitions in diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity over time and associated risk factors in an Asian population with diabetes. Longitudinal cohort study METHODS: We analyzed data from 9481 adults in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program (2010-2015) with linkage to death registry. A multistate Markov model adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes duration, HbA1c, and body mass index (BMI) was applied to estimate annual transition probabilities between four DR states (no, mild, moderate, and severe/proliferative) and death, and the mean sojourn time in each state. The median assessment interval was 12 months, with most patients having 3 assessments. Annual probabilities for DR progression (no-to-mild, mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe/proliferative) were 6.1%, 7.0% and 19.3%, respectively; and for regression (mild-to-no, moderate-to-mild and severe-to-moderate) were 55.4%, 17.3% and 4.4%, respectively. Annual mortality rates from each DR state were 1.2%, 2.0%, 18.7%, and 30.0%. The sojourn time in each state were 8.2, 0.8, 0.8 and 2.2 years. Higher HbA1c and SBP levels were associated with progression of no-mild and mild-moderate DR, and diabetes duration with no-to-mild and moderate-to-severe/proliferative DR. Lower HbA1c levels were associated with regression from mild-to-no and moderate-to-mild, and higher BMI with mild-to-no DR. Our results suggest a prolonged duration (~8 years) in developing mild DR, with faster transitions (within a year) from mild or moderate states. Moderate/above DR greatly increases the probability of progression and death as compared to mild DR/below. HbA1c was associated with both progression as well as regression.",['Seshasai S; He F; Wen BLJ; Hamzah H; Cheng CY; Li J; Wong TY; Tan GSW; Sabanayagam C'],2024,"9481 adults in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program analyzed data. a multistate Markov model adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diabetes duration, HbA1c, and body mass index (BMI) was applied to estimate annual transition probabilities between four DR states. annual mortality rates from each DR state were 1.2%, 2.0%, 18.7%, and 30.0%."
Survival Outcomes of Patients with Esophageal Cancer and Post-chemoradiotherapy Surgical T4b Disease: Is Palliative Resection Justified?,"In patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who had undergone chemoradiotherapy (CRT), the limitations of radiological evaluation may necessitate surgical exploration to ascertain disease resectability. Upon intraoperative confirmation of T4b disease (sT4b), the optimal management strategy remains unclear. While some surgeons may opt against resection, others advocate for palliative esophagectomy (PE). Regrettably, the current literature does not provide a consensus on the most effective approach for managing these intricate cases. The study cohort consisted of 68 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who presented with sT4b disease following CRT. The perioperative outcomes and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients who underwent PE (n = 56) and those who received an open-close (OC) procedure (n = 12). Patients who underwent an OC procedure experienced a shorter hospital stay (16.5 vs. 28.8 days; p = 0.052) and showed a non-significant reduction in the rate of major complications (33.9% vs. 25%; p = 0.549) and in-hospital mortality (0% vs. 5.4%; p = 0.412) than those who received PE; however, PE was associated with a superior 2-year OS rate than OC (9.6% vs. 0%; p = 0.009). In multivariable analysis, a pretreatment clinical stage of II/III (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.87; p = 0.013) and PE with retrosternal reconstruction (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.49; p = 0.010) were independently associated with a more favorable OS.

The risk of endocrine immune-related adverse events induced by PD-1 inhibitors in cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Endocrinopathies are the most common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) observed during therapy with PD-1 inhibitors. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of immune-related endocrinopathies in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. We performed a systematic search in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to retrieve all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving PD-1 inhibitors, spanning from their inception to November 24, 2023. The comparative analysis encompassed patients undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or receiving placebo as control treatments. This study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023488303). A total of 48 clinical trials comprising 24,514 patients were included. Compared with control groups, patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors showed an increased risk of immune-related adverse events, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus, and adrenal insufficiency. Pembrolizumab was associated with an increased risk of all aforementioned endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism: RR=4.76, 95%CI: 3.55-6.39; hyperthyroidism: RR=9.69, 95%CI: 6.95-13.52; hypophysitis: RR=5.47, 95%CI: 2.73-10.97; thyroiditis: RR=5.95, 95%CI: 3.02-11.72; diabetes mellitus: RR=3.60, 95%CI: 1.65-7.88; adrenal insufficiency: RR=4.80, 95%CI: 2.60-8.88). Nivolumab was associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism (RR=7.67, 95%CI: 5.00-11.75) and hyperthyroidism (RR=9.22, 95%CI: 4.71-18.04). Tislelizumab and sintilimab were associated with an increased risk of hypothyroidism (RR=19.07, 95%CI: 5.46-66.69 for tislelizumab and RR=18.36, 95%CI: 3.58-94.21 for sintilimab). For different tumor types, both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism were at high risks. Besides, patients with non-small cell lung cancer were at a higher risk of thyroiditis and adrenal insufficiency. Patients with melanoma were at a higher risk of hypophysitis and diabetes mellitus. Both low- and high-dose group increased risks of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Risk of endocrine irAEs may vary in different PD-1 inhibitors and different tumor types. Increased awareness and understanding of the risk features of endocrine irAEs associated with PD-1 inhibitors is critical for clinicians. crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier PROSPERO (CRD42023488303).",['Zhao P; Zhao T; Yu L; Ma W; Liu W; Zhang C'],2024,endocrinopathies are the most common immune-related adverse events (irAEs) observed during therapy with PD-1 inhibitors. a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the risk of immune-related endocrinopathies in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors.
Natural proteome diversity links aneuploidy tolerance to protein turnover.,"Accessing the natural genetic diversity of species unveils hidden genetic traits, clarifies gene functions and allows the generalizability of laboratory findings to be assessed. One notable discovery made in natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is that aneuploidy-an imbalance in chromosome copy numbers-is frequent<sup>1,2</sup> (around 20%), which seems to contradict the substantial fitness costs and transient nature of aneuploidy when it is engineered in the laboratory<sup>3-5</sup>. Here we generate a proteomic resource and merge it with genomic<sup>1</sup> and transcriptomic<sup>6</sup> data for 796 euploid and aneuploid natural isolates. We find that natural and lab-generated aneuploids differ specifically at the proteome. In lab-generated aneuploids, some proteins-especially subunits of protein complexes-show reduced expression, but the overall protein levels correspond to the aneuploid gene dosage. By contrast, in natural isolates, more than 70% of proteins encoded on aneuploid chromosomes are dosage compensated, and average protein levels are shifted towards the euploid state chromosome-wide. At the molecular level, we detect an induction of structural components of the proteasome, increased levels of ubiquitination, and reveal an interdependency of protein turnover rates and attenuation. Our study thus highlights the role of protein turnover in mediating aneuploidy tolerance, and shows the utility of exploiting the natural diversity of species to attain generalizable molecular insights into complex biological processes.",['Muenzner J; Trébulle P; Agostini F; Zauber H; Messner CB; Steger M; Kilian C; Lau K; Barthel N; Lehmann A; Textoris-Taube K; Caudal E; Egger AS; Amari F; De Chiara M; Demichev V; Gossmann TI; Mülleder M; Liti G; Schacherer J; Selbach M; Berman J; Ralser M'],2024,"aneuploidy-an imbalance in chromosome copy numbers-is frequentsup>1,2/sup> (around 20%), which seems to contradict the substantial fitness costs and transient nature of aneuploidy. we find that natural and lab-generated aneuploids differ specifically at the proteome."

Development and Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting Nutritional Risk Based on Frailty Scores in Older Stroke Patients.,"In older stroke patients with frailty, nutritional deficiencies can amplify their susceptibility, delay recovery, and deteriorate prognosis. A precise predictive model is crucial to assess their nutritional risk, enabling targeted interventions for improved clinical outcomes. To develop and externally validate a nutritional risk prediction model integrating general demographics, physical parameters, psychological indicators, and biochemical markers. The aim is to facilitate the early identification of older stroke patients requiring nutritional intervention. This was a multicenter cross-sectional study. A total of 570 stroke patients were included, 434 as the modeling set and 136 as the external validation set. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to select the predictor variables. Internal validation was performed using Bootstrap resampling (1000 iterations). The nomogram was constructed based on the results of logistic regression. The performance assessment relied on the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), Hosmer--Lemeshow test, calibration curves, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The predictive nomogram encompassed seven pivotal variables: Activities of Daily Living (ADL), NIHSS score, diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), grip strength, serum albumin levels, and depression. Together, these variables comprehensively evaluate the overall health and nutritional status of elderly stroke patients, facilitating accurate assessment of their nutritional risk. The model exhibited excellent accuracy in both the development and external validation sets, evidenced by AUC values of 0.934 and 0.887, respectively. Such performance highlights its efficacy in pinpointing elderly stroke patients who require nutritional intervention. Moreover, the model showed robust goodness of fit and practical applicability, providing essential clinical insights to improve recovery and prognosis for patients prone to malnutrition. Elderly individuals recovering from stroke often experience significant nutritional deficiencies. The nomogram we devised accurately assesses this risk by combining physiological, psychological, and biochemical metrics. It equips healthcare providers with the means to actively screen for and manage the nutritional care of these patients. This tool is instrumental in swiftly identifying those in urgent need of targeted nutritional support, which is essential for optimizing their recovery and managing their nutrition more effectively.",['Liu L; He C; Yang J; Chen W; Xie Y; Chen X'],2024,"570 stroke patients were included in the model, 434 as the modeling set and 136 as the external validation set. the model exhibited excellent accuracy in both the development and external validation sets."
Survival benefit of nephroureterectomy in systemic therapy exposed metastatic upper tract urinary urothelial carcinoma patients.,"It is unknown whether the stage of the primary may influence the survival (OS) of metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma (mUTUC) patients treated with nephroureterectomy (NU) and systemic therapy (ST). We tested this hypothesis within a large-scale North American cohort. Within Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database 2000-2020, all mUTUC patients treated with ST+NU or with ST alone were identified. Kaplan-Maier plots depicted OS. Multivariable Cox regression (MCR) models tested for differences between ST+NU and ST alone predicting overall mortality (OM). All analyses were performed in localized (T1-T2) and then repeated in locally advanced (T3-T4) patients. Of all 728 mUTUC patients, 187 (26%) harbored T1-T2 vs 541 (74%) harbored T3-T4. In T1-T2 patients, the median OS was 20 months in ST+NU vs 10 months in ST alone. Moreover, in MCR analyses that also relied on 3 months' landmark analyses, the combination of ST+NU independently predicted lower OM (HR 0.37, p < 0.001). Conversely, in T3-T4 patients, the median OS was 12 in ST+NU vs 10 months in ST alone. Moreover, in MCR analyses that also relied on 3 months' landmark analyses, the combination of ST+NU was not independently associated with lower OM (HR 0.85, p = 0.1). In mUTUC patients, treated with ST, NU drastically improved survival in T1-T2 patients, even after strict methodological adjustments (multivariable and landmark analyses). However, this survival benefit did not apply to patients with locally more advanced disease (T3-T4).",['Morra S; Incesu RB; Scheipner L; Baudo A; Jannello LMI; Siech C; de Angelis M; Tian Z; Creta M; Califano G; Collà Ruvolo C; Saad F; Shariat SF; Chun FKH; de Cobelli O; Musi G; Briganti A; Tilki D; Ahyai S; Carmignani L; Longo N; Karakiewicz PI'],2024,mUTUC patients treated with nephroureterectomy and systemic therapy were identified. 187 (26%) harbored T1-T2 vs 541 (74%) harbored T3-T4. median OS was 20 months in ST+NU vs 10 months in ST alone.
Noninvasive Assessment of Tumor Histological Grade in Invasive Breast Carcinoma Based on Ultrasound Radiomics and Clinical Characteristics: A Multicenter Study.,"<b>Rationale and Objectives:</b> We aimed to develop and validate prediction models for histological grade of invasive breast carcinoma (BC) based on ultrasound radiomics features and clinical characteristics. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A number of 383 patients with invasive BC were retrospectively enrolled and divided into a training set (207 patients), internal validation set (90 patients), and external validation set (86 patients). Ultrasound radiomics features were extracted from all the eligible patients. The Boruta method was used to identify the most useful features. Seven classifiers were adopted to developed prediction models. The output of the classifier with best performance was labeled as the radiomics score (Rad-score) and the classifier was selected as the Rad-score model. A combined model combining clinical factors and Rad-score was developed. The performance of the models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve. <b>Results:</b> Seven radiomics features were selected from 788 candidate features. The logistic regression model performing best among the 7 classifiers in the internal and external validation sets was considered as Rad-score model, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.731 and 0.738. The tumor size was screened out as the risk factor and the combined model was developed, with AUC values of 0.721 and 0.737 in the internal and external validation sets. Furthermore, the 10-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the 2 models above were reliable and stable. <b>Conclusion:</b> The Rad-score model and combined model were able to predict histological grade of invasive BC, which may enable tailored therapeutic strategies for patients with BC in routine clinical use.",['Ge L; Wu J; Jin Y; Xu D; Wang Z'],2024,a number of 383 patients with invasive BC were retrospectively enrolled. the results were based on ultrasound radiomics features and clinical characteristics. the results were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve.
Biomimetic Cancer-Targeting Nanoplatform Boosting AIEgens-Based Photodynamic Therapy and Ferroptosis by Disrupting Redox-Homeostasis.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (AIE-PS) holds tremendous potential but is limited by its inherent disadvantages and the high concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells that can neutralize ROS to weaken PDT. Herein, we designed a nanodelivery system (CM-HSA<sup>DSP</sup>@[PS-Sor]) in which albumin was utilized as a carrier for hydrophobic drug AIE-PS and Sorafenib, cross-linkers with disulfide bonds were introduced to form a nanogel core, and then cancer cell membranes were wrapped on its surface to confer homologous tumor targeting ability. A two-way strategy was employed to disturb redox-homeostasis through blocking GSH synthesis by Sorafenib and consuming excess GSH via abundant disulfide bonds, thereby promoting the depletion of GSH, which in turn increased the ROS levels in cancer cells to amplify the efficacy of ferroptosis and PDT, achieving an efficient in vivo antibreast cancer effect. This study brings a new strategy for ROS-based cancer therapy and expands the application of an albumin-based drug delivery system.",['Wan Y; Cao Y; Hu D; Lai Q; Liu Y; Chen Y; Wu M; Feng S'],2024,photodynamic therapy (PDT) using aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer (AIE-PS) holds tremendous potential but is limited by its inherent disadvantages. albumin was used as a carrier for hydrophobic drug AIE-PS and Sorafenib. a two-way strategy was employed to disturb redox-homeostasis through blocking GSH synthesis by Sorafenib and consuming excess GSH via abundant disulfide bonds
Resveratrol protects against diabetic retinal ganglion cell damage by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway.,"Oxidative stress-induced retinal neurodegenerative changes are among the pathological alterations observed in diabetic retinopathy. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic compound with diverse pharmacological effects, has shown preventive qualities in several neurodegenerative illnesses, including anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and antioxidant benefits. However, its therapeutic efficacy in diabetic retinal neurodegeneration has not yet been thoroughly elucidated. Our study aimed to explore the protective mechanisms and therapeutic benefits of RSV on diabetic retinal neurodegeneration alterations. Using streptozotocin, we created a diabetic mouse model and conducted visual electrophysiological examinations on mice from the normal group, diabetic group, and diabetic group treated with RSV. Retinas were harvested for histological staining. Additionally, primary retinal ganglion cells cultured in high glucose conditions were used to assess malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels upon siRNA-mediated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) interference. Protein levels of Nrf-2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and transcriptional levels of them were also measured. We demonstrated that RSV significantly improved the retinal morphology and function in the diabetic retinopathy model mice. The treated mice exhibited notable improvements in visual electrophysiology, with a significant reduction in retinal ganglion cell apoptosis. Following RSV treatment, the high glucose-cultured ganglion cells demonstrated a considerable rise in SOD levels and a substantial drop in MOD. Moreover, the protein expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and Nrf2 significantly increased. RT-PCR and Western blot results indicated a significant attenuation of RSV's therapeutic effects upon Nrf2 inhibition. Our findings suggest that RSV may reduce oxidative stress levels in the retina and inhibit retinal ganglion cell apoptosis via reducing the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which lessens the harm that excessive glucose causes to the retina.",['Yuan D; Xu Y; Xue L; Zhang W; Gu L; Liu Q'],2024,a diabetic mouse model was created to study the protective mechanisms and therapeutic benefits of RSV on diabetic retinal neurodegeneration alterations. the mice showed significant improvements in visual electrophysiology.
Remote monitoring of atrial fibrillation recurrence using mHealth technology (REMOTE-AF).,"This proof-of-concept study sought to evaluate changes in heart rate (HR) obtained from a consumer wearable device and compare against implantable loop recorder (ILR)-detected recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial tachycardia (AT) after AF ablation. REMOTE-AF (NCT05037136) was a prospectively designed sub-study of the CASA-AF randomized controlled trial (NCT04280042). Participants without a permanent pacemaker had an ILR implanted at their index ablation procedure for longstanding persistent AF. Heart rate and step count were continuously monitored using photoplethysmography (PPG) from a commercially available wrist-worn wearable. Photoplethysmography-recorded HR data were pre-processed with noise filtration and episodes at 1-min interval over 30 min of HR elevations (<i>Z</i>-score = 2) were compared with corresponding ILR data. Thirty-five patients were enrolled, with mean age 70.3 ± 6.8 years and median follow-up 10 months (interquartile range 8-12 months). Implantable loop recorder analysis revealed 17 out of 35 patients (49%) had recurrence of AF/AT. Compared with ILR recurrence, wearable-derived elevations in HR ≥ 110 beats per minute had a sensitivity of 95.3%, specificity 54.1%, positive predictive value (PPV) 15.8%, negative predictive value (NPV) 99.2%, and overall accuracy 57.4%. With PPG-recorded HR elevation spikes (non-exercise related), the sensitivity was 87.5%, specificity 62.2%, PPV 39.2%, NPV 92.3%, and overall accuracy 64.0% in the entire patient cohort. In the AF/AT recurrence only group, sensitivity was 87.6%, specificity 68.3%, PPV 53.6%, NPV 93.0%, and overall accuracy 75.0%.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors for POLE or POLD1 proofreading-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.,"POLE and POLD1 proofreading deficiency (POLE/D1pd) define a rare subtype of ultramutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC; over 100 mut/Mb). Disease-specific data about the activity and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in POLE/D1pd mCRC are lacking and it is unknown whether outcomes may be different from mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRCs treated with ICIs. In this global study, we collected 27 patients with mCRC harboring POLE/D1 mutations leading to proofreading deficiency and treated with anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 alone +/- anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 agents. We collected clinicopathological and genomic characteristics, response, and survival outcomes after ICIs of POLE/D1pd mCRC and compared them with a cohort of 610 dMMR/MSI-H mCRC patients treated with ICIs. Further genomic analyses were carried out in an independent cohort of 7241 CRCs to define POLE and POLD1pd molecular profiles and mutational signatures. POLE/D1pd was associated with younger age, male sex, fewer RAS/BRAF driver mutations, and predominance of right-sided colon cancers. Patients with POLE/D1pd mCRC showed a significantly higher overall response rate (ORR) compared to dMMR/MSI-H mCRC (89% versus 54%; P = 0.01). After a median follow-up of 24.9 months (interquartile range: 11.3-43.0 months), patients with POLE/D1pd showed a significantly superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to dMMR/MSI-H mCRC [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.74, P = 0.01] and superior overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-1.18, P = 0.09). In multivariable analyses including the type of DNA repair defect, POLE/D1pd was associated with significantly improved PFS (HR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.69, P = 0.013) and OS (HR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.06-0.98, P = 0.047). Molecular profiling showed that POLE/D1pd tumors have higher tumor mutational burden (TMB). Responses were observed in both subtypes and were associated with the intensity of POLE/D1pd signature. Patients with POLE/D1pd mCRC showed more favorable outcomes compared to dMMR/MSI-H mCRC to treatment with ICIs in terms of tumor response and survival.",['Ambrosini M; Rousseau B; Manca P; Artz O; Marabelle A; André T; Maddalena G; Mazzoli G; Intini R; Cohen R; Cercek A; Segal NH; Saltz L; Varghese AM; Yaeger R; Nusrat M; Goldberg Z; Ku GY; El Dika I; Margalit O; Grinshpun A; Kasi P; Schilsky R; Lutfi A; Shacham-Shmueli E; Khan Afghan M; Weiss L; Westphalen CB; Conca V; Decker B; Randon G; Elez E; Fakih M; Schrock AB; Cremolini C; Jayachandran P; Overman MJ; Lonardi S; Pietrantonio F'],2024,POLE and POLD1 proofreading deficiency define a rare subtype of ultramutated metastatic colorectal cancer. disease-specific data about the activity and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors are lacking. it is unknown whether outcomes may be different from mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRCs treated with ICIs.
Deciphering the Epigenetic Symphony of Cancer: Insights and Epigenetic Therapies Implications.,"Epigenetic machinery is a cornerstone in normal cell development, orchestrating tissue-specific gene expression in mammalian cells. Aberrations in this intricate landscape drive substantial changes in gene function, emerging as a linchpin in cancer etiology and progression. While cancer was conventionally perceived as solely a genetic disorder, its contemporary definition encompasses genetic alterations intertwined with disruptive epigenetic abnormalities. This review explores the profound impact of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs on fundamental cellular processes. When these pivotal epigenetic mechanisms undergo disruption, they intricately guide the acquisition of the 6 hallmark characteristics of cancer within seemingly normal cells. Leveraging the latest advancements in decoding these epigenetic intricacies holds immense promise, heralding a new era in developing targeted and more efficacious treatment modalities against cancers driven by aberrant epigenetic modifications.",['Akram F; Tanveer R; Andleeb S; Shah FI; Ahmad T; Shehzadi S; Akhtar AM; Syed G'],2024,epigenetic machinery is a cornerstone in normal cell development. but the intricate landscape drives substantial changes in gene function. the review explores the profound impact of DNA methylation and histone modifications on fundamental cellular processes.
Development of an anoikis-related gene signature and prognostic model for predicting the tumor microenvironment and response to immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.,"The effect of anoikis-related genes (ARGs) on clinicopathological characteristics and tumor microenvironment remains unclear. We comprehensively analyzed anoikis-associated gene signatures of 1057 colorectal cancer (CRC) samples based on 18 ARGs. Anoikis-related molecular subtypes and gene features were identified through consensus clustering analysis. The biological functions and immune cell infiltration were assessed using the GSVA and ssGSEA algorithms. Prognostic risk score was constructed using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The immunological features of high-risk and low-risk groups were compared. Finally, DAPK2-overexpressing plasmid was transfected to measure its effect on tumor proliferation and metastasis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We identified 18 prognostic ARGs. Three different subtypes of anoikis were identified and demonstrated to be linked to distinct biological processes and prognosis. Then, a risk score model was constructed and identified as an independent prognostic factor. Compared to the high-risk group, patients in the low-risk group exhibited longer survival, higher enrichment of checkpoint function, increased expression of CTLA4 and PD-L1, higher IPS scores, and a higher proportion of MSI-H. The results of RT-PCR indicated that the expression of DAPK2 mRNA was significantly downregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. Increased DAPK2 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and inhibited migration and invasion. The nude mice xenograft tumor model confirmed that high expression of DAPK2 inhibited tumor growth. Collectively, we discovered an innovative anoikis-related gene signature associated with prognosis and TME. Besides, our study indicated that DAPK2 can serve as a promising therapeutic target for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of CRC.",['Li C; Weng J; Yang L; Gong H; Liu Z'],2024,anoikis-related gene signatures of 1057 colorectal cancer samples were identified. the biological functions and immune cell infiltration were assessed.
Ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy for focal liver lesions: Adverse events and diagnostic yield in a single-centre analysis.,"Ultrasound-guided biopsy of focal liver lesions (FLL) is a well-established procedure with crucial impact on therapeutic decisions. The safety and accuracy depend on needle type, tumour location and comorbidities. Modern oncological concepts often require large tumour specimens which may increase the procedural risk. We retrospectively collected data from consecutively scheduled ultrasound-guided FLL biopsies performed in an interdisciplinary ultrasound unit at a university hospital from 2015-2020. We analysed complication rates, diagnostic accuracy, and patient outcome in a one-year period. Of 426 scheduled interventions, 339 were included: 322 primary biopsies (40% female, median age 65 years, median BMI 25.4 kg/m2) and 17 rebiopsies in cases with undetermined diagnosis. Indications comprised 309 (96%) cases with suspected malignant lesions. Important comorbidities were type 2 diabetes (n = 107, 33%) and cirrhosis (n = 64, 20%). A conclusive histopathological diagnosis was achieved in 270 (84%) cases with a weak association with lesion size (OR 1.12 per cm, 95%CI 0.99-1.27). Greater BMI (OR 0.60 per 10 BMI points, 95%CI 0.34-1.05) showed a trend towards an insufficient diagnosis. Relevant complications occurred in 8 (2.5%) cases (2 major; 1 life-threatening). Multiple passes showed a trend towards adverse events (OR 2.32 for > 1 pass, 95%CI 0.99-5.42). 93 (29%) patients died during a median follow-up of 171 days. Ultrasound-guided FLL biopsy is an efficient and safe diagnostic measure.

Effects of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists on Gastric Mucosal Visibility and Retained Gastric Contents During Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are increasingly utilized in diabetes and obesity management. GLP-1RAs delay gastric emptying; however, their impact on visibility during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) remains uncertain. A 1:1 matched case-control study was conducted. Individuals undergoing EGD on GLP-1RAs were matched to non-users based on demographics and diabetes status. A validated scale (POLPREP) was used to determine gastric mucosal visibility scores. A total of 84 pairs (n=168) were included. GLP-1RA users showed significantly lower visibility scores, with a 2.54 times higher likelihood of lower scores compared to non-users. Additionally, GLP-1RA users had a higher incidence of retained gastric contents (13.1% vs. 4.8%, aOR:4.62, p=0.025) and aborted procedures due to this issue. No anesthesia-related adverse events were observed. GLP-1RA use at the time of endoscopy exhibited higher odds of lower gastric mucosal visibility scores, retained contents and aborted procedures.

MicroRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications: A narrative review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. Microribonucleic acids (microRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules synthesized in the nucleus, modified, and exported to the extracellular environment to bind to their complementary target sequences. It regulates protein synthesis in the targeted cells by inhibiting translation or triggering the degradation of the target messenger. MicroRNA-29 is one of noncoding RNA that can be secreted by adipose tissue, hepatocytes, islet cells, and brain cells. The expression level of the microRNA-29 family in several metabolic organs is regulated by body weight, blood concentrations of inflammatory mediators, serum glucose levels, and smoking habits. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the effect of microRNA-29 on the expression of target genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin synthesis and secretion, islet cell survival, and proliferation. These findings shed new light on the role of microRNA-29 in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, which plays a vital role in developing appropriate therapies. Different molecular pathways have been proposed to explain how microRNA-29 promotes the development of diabetes and its complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no published review article has summarized the molecular mechanism of microRNA-29-mediated initiation of DM and its complications. Therefore, this narrative review aims to summarize the role of microRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.",['Yesuf HA; Molla MD; Malik T; Seyoum Wendimagegn Z; Yimer Y'],2024,"microRNA-29 regulates protein synthesis in the targeted cells. it is one of noncoding RNA that can be secreted by adipose tissue, hepatocytes, islet cells, and brain cells."
Improved Preservation of Mouse Intestinal Tissue Using a Formalin/Acetic Acid Fixative and Quantitative Histological Analysis Using QuPath.,"The architecture and morphology of the intestinal tissue from mice or other small animals are difficult to preserve for histological and molecular analysis due to the fragile nature of this tissue. The intestinal mucosa consists of villi and crypts lined with epithelial cells. In between the epithelial folds extends the lamina propria, a loose connective tissue that contains blood and lymph vessels, fibroblasts, and immune cells. Underneath the mucosa are two layers of contractile smooth muscle and nerves. The tissue experiences significant changes during fixation, which can impair the reliability of histologic analysis. Poor-quality histologic sections are not suitable for quantitative image-based tissue analysis. This article offers a new fixative composed of neutral buffered formalin (NBF) and acetic acid, called FA. This fixative significantly improved the histology of mouse intestinal tissue compared to traditional NBF and enabled precise, reproducible histologic molecular analyses using QuPath software. Algorithmic training of QuPath allows for automated segmentation of intestinal compartments, which can be further interrogated for cellular composition and disease-related changes. © 2024 The Authors.

Body Composition in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Immunotherapy.,"The association between body composition (BC) and cancer outcomes is complex and incompletely understood. Previous research in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been limited to small, single-institution studies and yielded promising, albeit heterogeneous, results. To evaluate the association of BC with oncologic outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. This comprehensive multicohort analysis included clinical data from cohorts receiving treatment at the Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center (DFBCC) who received immunotherapy given alone or in combination with chemotherapy and prospectively collected data from the phase 1/2 Study 1108 and the chemotherapy arm of the phase 3 MYSTIC trial. Baseline and follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans were collected and analyzed using deep neural networks for automatic L3 slice selection and body compartment segmentation (skeletal muscle [SM], subcutaneous adipose tissue [SAT], and visceral adipose tissue). Outcomes were compared based on baseline BC measures or their change at the first follow-up scan. The data were analyzed between July 2022 and April 2023. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the association of BC measurements with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A total of 1791 patients (878 women [49%]) with NSCLC were analyzed, of whom 487 (27.2%) received chemoimmunotherapy at DFBCC (DFBCC-CIO), 825 (46.1%) received ICI monotherapy at DFBCC (DFBCC-IO), 222 (12.4%) were treated with durvalumab monotherapy on Study 1108, and 257 (14.3%) were treated with chemotherapy on MYSTIC; median (IQR) ages were 65 (58-74), 66 (57-71), 65 (26-87), and 63 (30-84) years, respectively. A loss in SM mass, as indicated by a change in the L3 SM area, was associated with worse oncologic outcome across patient groups (HR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.43-0.81] and 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79] for OS and PFS, respectively, in DFBCC-CIO; HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.60-0.91] for OS in DFBCC-IO; HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.33-0.64] and 0.47 [95% CI, 0.34-0.64] for OS and PFS, respectively, in Study 1108; HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.61-0.96] for PFS in the MYSTIC trial). This association was most prominent among male patients, with a nonsignificant association among female patients in the MYSTIC trial and DFBCC-CIO cohorts on Kaplan-Meier analysis. An increase of more than 5% in SAT density, as quantified by the average CT attenuation in Hounsfield units of the SAT compartment, was associated with poorer OS in 3 patient cohorts (HR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.43-0.86] for DFBCC-CIO; HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.49-0.79] for DFBCC-IO; and HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.40-0.77] for Study 1108). The change in SAT density was also associated with PFS for DFBCC-CIO (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97). This was primarily observed in female patients on Kaplan-Meier analysis. The results of this multicohort study suggest that loss in SM mass during systemic therapy for NSCLC is a marker of poor outcomes, especially in male patients. SAT density changes are also associated with prognosis, particularly in female patients. Automated CT-derived BC measurements should be considered in determining NSCLC prognosis.",['Chaunzwa TL; Qian JM; Li Q; Ricciuti B; Nuernberg L; Johnson JW; Weiss J; Zhang Z; MacKay J; Kagiampakis I; Bikiel D; Di Federico A; Alessi JV; Mak RH; Jacob E; Awad MM; Aerts HJWL'],2024,"previous research in non-small-cell lung cancer has been limited to small, single-institution studies. a total of 1791 patients (878 women [49%] with NSCLC were analyzed."
Shuangdong Capsule Activates Insulin Signal Pathway to Improve Urinary Tract Infection in Diabetic Rats.,"Diabetes and Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are both common and serious health problems. Shuangdong capsule, a Chinese patent medicine, has been used to treat these conditions. This study assesses its efficacy and mechanism in treating diabetes combined with UTIs. We induced diabetes in rats using streptozotocin and UTIs with Escherichia coli, dividing the rats into five groups: control, model, levofloxacin, Shuangdong capsule, and levofloxacin + Shuangdong capsule. After two weeks, we measured blood glucose, insulin, infection indicators, and bladder histology. We also detected the expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt)-C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) signaling pathway by Western Blot and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Additionally, we conducted a Mendelian randomization study using genetic variants of the insulin receptor to assess its causal effect on UTI risk. Shuangdong capsule improved bladder pathology and infection indicators, similar to levofloxacin. It did not affect blood glucose or insulin levels. Moreover, it reversed the suppression of the IRS1-PI3K-Akt-CXCL2 pathway and MPO levels caused by UTI in diabetic rats. The Mendelian randomization study showed that increased insulin receptor expression reduced UTI risk, which was consistent with the results of the animal experiments. The Shuangdong capsule was effective in treating diabetes with UTIs. It may function by activating the IRS1-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, thereby increasing CXCL2 and MPO levels, enhancing innate immunity, and promoting bacterial clearance. The Mendelian randomization study provided further evidence supporting the causal role of the insulin receptor in UTI prevention.",['Zhao C; Wang B; Mu QX; Wu J; Cheng ZH; Liu Q; Li HS; Wang J'],2024,"levofloxacin, levofloxacin, and levofloxacin + Shuangdong capsule induced diabetes. the study assessed its efficacy and mechanism in treating diabetes combined with UTIs."

Diagnosis and Management of Periprosthetic Joint Infections After Total Ankle Arthroplasty.,"Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is a dreaded complication that may lead to catastrophic outcomes. Risk factors include a history of surgery on the operated ankle, low preoperative function scores, diabetes, extended surgical time, and postoperative wound-healing problems. Clinical presentation varies and may include increasing ankle pain and swelling, high temperature, local erythema, wound drainage, and dehiscence. The initial diagnostic evaluation should include plain radiographs, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte count. In suspected cases with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, aspiration of the ankle joint for synovial fluid analysis, Gram staining, and culture should be performed. Antibiotic therapy should be based on the pathogen identified, and the surgical strategy should be determined based on the time lines of PJI. Early PJI can be treated with irrigation and débridement with polyethylene exchange. The surgical treatment of choice for late PJI is two-stage revision arthroplasty, which includes removal of the implant, insertion of an antibiotic spacer, and reimplantation of a TAA. In certain chronic PJI cases, permanent articulating antibiotic spacers can be left in place or an ankle arthrodesis can be performed. Below-knee amputation is considered as the final option after limb-sparing procedures have failed.",['Atesok K; Scott DJ; Hurwitz S; Gross CE'],2024,"periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) is a dreaded complication. risk factors include a history of surgery on the operated ankle. low preoperative function scores, diabetes, extended surgical time."
Long-term outcome and fertility results of intraplacental choriocarcinoma: a retrospective study of 14 patients and literature review.,"Intraplacental choriocarcinoma (IC) is an extremely rare subtype of gestational choriocarcinoma. The long-term follow-up and reproductive outcomes of IC patients remain unclear. Here, we report a series of 14 cases and conduct a literature review to assess the fertility and recurrence results of this rare disease. Fourteen patients with pathologically confirmed IC treated in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2002 and July 2022 were included in this study. Half of them had metastatic IC and were treated by chemotherapy with or without surgery. Only 1 patient had chemoresistant disease, but she achieved complete remission after immunotherapy. The median follow-up time was 45.5 months (range 4-192), and no recurrence occurred. One metastatic IC patient who achieved remission after chemotherapy had a full-term delivery. Among the 5 patients with fertility demands, 3 abandoned their pursuit of pregnancy because of ""fear and worry about choriocarcinoma recurrence"". We reviewed a total of 89 cases of IC in English and Chinese literature from 1963 to 2022, and only 5 cases with subsequent pregnancy were reported, all of them were nonmetastatic IC cases. IC is sensitive to chemotherapy and has good long-term remission and a low recurrence rate. Patients with metastatic or nonmetastatic IC can have good pregnancy results after treatment. Doctors should pay more attention to the psychology of these patients.

Melanoma in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients.,"Melanoma in younger individuals has different clinical presentations, histologic characteristics and prognosis from older patients. This review summarizes key differences and important new insights into pediatric and young adult melanoma, as well as recent evolutions in treatment. Molecular techniques have improved the classification of melanocytic neoplasms, and are especially useful in the workup of the diagnostically challenging lesions frequent in this age group. Molecular evaluation highlights differences between melanoma and atypical lesions with Spitz-like morphology, and should routinely be incorporated for diagnosing and classifying Spitzoid melanocytic to guide prognostication and treatment. Once diagnosed, the management of bona fide melanoma in children and young adults is largely similar to older patients, while the optimal management of lesions such as atypical Spitz tumors remains uncertain. Increased awareness of the presentation and diagnostic characteristics of melanoma in young individuals will allow earlier detection, and improved diagnostic techniques will allow optimum management without over- or under-treatment.",['Sondak VK; Messina JL'],2024,"melanoma in younger individuals has different clinical presentations, histologic characteristics and prognosis from older patients. molecular techniques have improved the classification of melanocytic neoplasms. melanoma in children and young adults is largely similar to older patients."
Investigation of the causal association between Parkinson's disease and autoimmune disorders: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"To date, an increasing number of epidemiological evidence has pointed to potential relationships between Parkinson's disease (PD) and various autoimmune diseases (AIDs), however, no definitive conclusions has been drawn about whether PD is causally related to AIDs risk. By employing summary statistics from the latest and most extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we performed a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal associations between PD and a variety of 17 AIDs, encompassing multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, myasthenia gravis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, type 1 diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis and vitiligo. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was adopted as the main statistical approach to obtain the causal estimates of PD on different AIDs, supplemented by a series of complementary analyses (weighted median, MR Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO) for further strengthening the robustness of results. Our MR findings suggested that genetically predicted higher liability to PD was causally associated with a decreased risk of irritable bowel syndrome (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99; <i>P</i> = 0.032). On the contrary, IVW analysis showed a potential positive correlation between genetically determined PD and the incidence of type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.10; 95%CI: 1.02-1.19; <i>P</i> = 0.010). Subsequent MR tests ended up in similar results, confirming our findings were reliable. Additionally, in the reverse MR analyses, we did not identify any evidence to support the causal relationship of genetic predisposition to AIDs with PD susceptibility. In general, a bifunctional role that PD exerted on the risk of developing AIDs was detected in our studies, both protecting against irritable bowel syndrome occurrence and raising the incidence of type 1 diabetes. Future studies, including population-based observational studies and molecular experiments <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, are warranted to validate the results of our MR analyses and refine the underlying pathological mechanisms involved in PD-AIDs associations.",['Yang J; Lin W; Ma Y; Song H; Mu C; Wu Q; Han C; Zhang J; Liu X'],2024,MR analysis was used to investigate causal associations between PD and 17 AIDs.

"Docosahexaenoic acid-loaded nanoparticles: A state-of-the-art of preparation methods, characterization, functionality, and therapeutic applications.","Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, offers several beneficial effects. DHA helps in reducing depression, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. It can stimulate the development of brain and nerve, alleviate lipids metabolism-related disorders, and enhance vision development. However, DHA susceptibility to chemical oxidation, poor water solubility, and unpleasant order could restrict its applications for nutritional and therapeutic purposes. To avoid these drawbacks and enhance its bioavailability, DHA can be encapsulated using an effective delivery system. Several encapsulation methods are recognized, and DHA-loaded nanoparticles have demonstrated numerous benefits. In clinical studies, positive influences on the development of several diseases have been reported, but some assumptions are conflicting and need more exploration, since DHA has a systemic and not a targeted release at the required level. This might cause the applications of nanoparticles that could allow DHA release at the required level and improve its efficiency, thus resulting in a better controlling of several diseases. In the current review, we focused on researches investigating the formulation and development of DHA-loaded nanoparticles using different delivery systems, including low-density lipoprotein, zinc oxide, silver, zein, and resveratrol-stearate. Silver-DHA nanoparticles presented a typical particle size of 24 nm with an incorporation level of 97.67 %, while the entrapment efficiency of zinc oxide-DHA nanoparticles represented 87.3 %. By using zein/Poly (lactic-<i>co</i>-glycolic acid) stabilized nanoparticles, DHA's encapsulation level reached 84.6 %. We have also highlighted the characteristics, functionality and medical implementation of these nanoparticles in the treatment of inflammations, brain disorders, diabetes as well as hepatocellular carcinoma.",['Ali AH; Hachem M; Ahmmed MK'],2024,"a fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) can reduce depression, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. it can stimulate the development of brain and nerve, alleviate lipids metabolism-related disorders, and enhance vision development."
"Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma (UTUC): Prevalence, Impact and Management Challenge.","Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is an aggressive and difficult malignancy to treat. Owing to its rarity and the lack of specific high-level data, management mirrors that of urothelial cancer of the bladder (UCB). Over the past decade, UTUC has shown minimal improvement in survival rates. Its location makes the diagnosis and staging of UTUC more complex. Moreover, surgery often leads to a decline in renal function, rendering a proportion of patients ineligible for cisplatin. There is debate as to how best manage locally advanced UTUC perioperatively. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have changed the treatment landscape for UCB, the response to ICIs in UTUC has been variable. With new technologies, our understanding of the molecular biology of UTUC has grown, helping to identify key molecular differences from UCB. This review summarises the evidence available on UTUC as a disease entity, discusses treatment in perioperative and metastatic settings, and considers future directions for the management of patients diagnosed with UTUC.",['Nally E; Young M; Chauhan V; Wells C; Szabados B; Powles T; Jackson-Spence F'],2024,urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is an aggressive malignancy to treat.

Concentration-QTc Modeling of the DPP-4 Inhibitor HSK7653 in a First-in-Human Study of Chinese Healthy Volunteers.,"Cofrogliptin (HSK7653) is a long-acting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus with a twice-monthly dosing regimen. This study included 62 participants (48 without food effect, 14 with food effect) receiving single doses of HSK7653 (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg) or placebo. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected over 24 hours postdosing and sampling times are aligned with 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) which were derived from continuous ECG recordings. For the concentration-QT interval corrected for heart rate (C-QTc) analysis, we used linear mixed-effects modeling to characterize the correlation between plasma concentrations of HSK7653 and the change from baseline in the QT interval which was corrected by Fridericia's formula (ΔQTcF). The result showed that a placebo-corrected Fridericia corrected QT interval (ΔΔQTcF) prolongation higher than 10 milliseconds is unlikely at the mean maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) (411 ng/mL) associated with the recommended therapeutic doses (25 mg twice-monthly), even at the highest supratherapeutic concentration (2425 ng/mL). Thus, HSK7653 does not significantly affect QT prolongation at either recommended doses or the highest supratherapeutic concentration.",['Wang X; Liu H; Cui C; Niu X; Li H; Niu S; Yan P; Wu N; Li F; Wu Q; Chen K; Hu B; Liu D'],2024,"cofrogliptin (HSK7653) is a long-acting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. this study included 62 participants receiving single doses of HSK7653 (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg) or placebo."
A self-assembling graphene oxide coating for enhanced bactericidal and osteogenic properties of poly-ether-ether-ketone.,"Poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK) is a biomedical plastic that can be used for orthopedic implants, but it offers poor antibacterial properties and bioactivity. In this study, PEEK was sulfonated with the obtained porous structure adsorbing graphene oxide (GO). The surface microstructures and properties of the original PEEK, sulfonated PEEK (SPEEK), and GO-grafted PEEK (GO-SPEEK) were characterized. The results revealed that the GO-SPEEK surface is a 3D porous structure exhibiting superior hydrophilicity to the original PEEK. Although SPEEK was shown to possess antimicrobial properties against both <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, the bactericidal effect was even more significant for GO-SPEEK, at about 86% and 94%, respectively. In addition, the <i>in vitro</i> simulated-body-fluid immersion and cell experiments indicated that GO-SPEEK had much better hydroxyapatite (HA)-precipitation induction capacity and cell-material interactions (e.g., cell adhesion, proliferation, osteodifferentiation, and extracellular matrix mineralization. The tensile test revealed that the mechanical properties of PEEK were maintained after surface modification, as GO-SPEEK has comparable values of elastic modulus and tensile strength to PEEK. Our investigation sought a method to simultaneously endow PEEK with both good antimicrobial properties and bioactivity as well as mechanical properties, providing a theoretical basis for developing high-performance orthopedic implants in the clinic.",['Huang R; Gu Y; Yuan Y; Wang Y; Pan Y; Li B; Ren G; Huang L; Xie Y'],2024,"poly-ether-ketone (PEEK) was sulfonated with the obtained porous structure adsorbing graphene oxide (GO) the surface microstructures and properties of the original PEEK, sulfonated PEEK (SPEEK) and GO-grafted PEEK (GO-SPEEK) were characterized."
Topical Application of Autologous Plasma-Derived Plasminogen Accelerates Healing of Chronic Foot Ulcers in Type 2 Diabetes Patients.,"Plasminogen (Pg) is currently considered a master regulator of wound healing, but the molecular mechanisms of its efficacy in improving impaired closure of chronic skin ulcers in type 2 diabetes patients remain unclear. Here, we investigated wound healing effects of autologous plasma-derived Pg in diabetes patients with chronic foot ulcers and evaluated Pg-induced changes in levels of key protein markers related to wound repair. Type 2 diabetes patients with chronic wounds of lower extremities were included in the study and received topical applications of Pg in a dose of 1.0 mg/mL every 2 days during 20 days, in addition to the standard wound management treatment. Patients treated only according to conventional protocol served as a control. Wound closure rates were monitored by digital planimetry of wound areas. Plasminogen supplementary treatment significantly accelerated relative wound closure as compared with diabetes patients from the control group (24 ± 4 days vs 120 ± 17 days, respectively, <i>P</i> < .01). As shown by Western blot, Pg application reduced expression of protein regulators of hypoxia events, angiogenesis, and autophagy such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (by 6.3-folds, <i>P</i> < .01), angiostatins (by 2.5-folds, <i>P</i> < .05), and autophagy marker LC3-II/LC3-I (by 8.6-folds, <i>P</i> < .05), while increasing vascular endothelial growth factor level by 1.9-folds (<i>P</i> < .05). Gelatin zymography showed that Pg-supplemented therapy decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) by 3.5-folds at the end of treatment period (<i>P</i> < .01).

Influence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease severity on carotid adventitial vasa vasorum.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a quarter of the world's population and encompasses a spectrum of liver conditions, from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, NAFLD also links to extrahepatic conditions like diabetes or obesity. However, it remains unclear if NAFLD independently correlates with the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the relationship between NAFLD severity, assessed via liver biopsy, and early atherosclerosis using adventitial vasa vasorum (VV) density. It included 44 patients with obesity (33 with steatosis, 11 with NASH) undergoing bariatric surgery. Results revealed no significant differences in adventitial VV density between steatosis and NASH groups, neither in the mean values [0.759 ± 0.104 vs. 0.780 ± 0.043, P=0.702] nor left-right sides. Similarly, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) did not vary between these groups. Additionally, no linear correlation existed between VV density and cIMT. Only gender showed an association with VV density. These findings suggest that NASH severity doesn't independently drive early atherosclerosis or affects cIMT. Gender might play a role in early atherosclerotic disease in NAFLD, impacting VV density and cIMT. This highlights the need to consider other risk factors when evaluating cardiovascular risk in NAFLD patients.",['León-Mengíbar J; Sánchez E; Herrerías F; De La Fuente MC; Santamaría M; Valdivielso JM; Bermúdez-López M; Castro E; Pallarés J; Matias-Guiu X; Vilardell F; Caixàs A; Bueno M; Martí R; Lecube A'],2024,"nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects a quarter of the world's population. it includes a spectrum of liver conditions, from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to inflammation and fibrosis. it remains unclear if NAFLD independently correlates with the onset and progression of atherosclerosis."
Exploring the interaction between a fluorescent Ag(I)-biscarbene complex and non-canonical DNA structures: a multi-technique investigation.,"Silver compounds are mainly studied as antimicrobial agents, but they also have anticancer properties, with the latter, in some cases, being better than their gold counterparts. Herein, we analyse the first example of a new Ag(I)-biscarbene that can bind non-canonical structures of DNA, more precisely G-quadruplexes (G4), with different binding signatures depending on the type of G4. Moreover, we show that this Ag-based carbene binds the i-motif DNA structure. Alternatively, its Au(I) counterpart, which was investigated for comparison, stabilises mitochondrial G4. Theoretical <i>in silico</i> studies elucidated the details of different binding modes depending on the geometry of G4. The two complexes showed increased cytotoxic activity compared to cisplatin, overcoming its resistance in ovarian cancer. The binding of these new drug candidates with other relevant biosubstrates was studied to afford a more complete picture of their possible targets. In particular, the Ag(I) complex preferentially binds DNA structures over RNA structures, with higher binding constants for the non-canonical nucleic acids with respect to natural calf thymus DNA. Regarding possible protein targets, its interaction with the albumin model protein BSA was also tested.",['Binacchi F; Giorgi E; Salvadori G; Cirri D; Stifano M; Donati A; Garzella L; Busto N; Garcia B; Pratesi A; Biver T'],2024,a new Ag(I)-biscarbene can bind non-canonical structures of DNA. it can also stabilise mitochondrial G4. the two complexes showed increased cytotoxic activity compared to cisplatin.
Discovery of novel small molecules targeting the USP21/JAK2/STAT3 axis for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.,"The deficiency in available targeted agents and frequency of chemoresistance are primary challenges in clinical management of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The aberrant expression of USP21 and JAK2 represents a characterized mechanism of TNBC progression and resistance to paclitaxel (PTX). Despite its clear that high expression of USP21-mediated de-ubiquitination leads to increased levels of JAK2 protein, we lack regulator molecules to dissect the mechanisms that the interaction between USP21 and JAK2 contributes to the phenotype and resistance of TNBC. Here, we report a USP21/JAK2/STAT3 axis-targeting regulator 13c featuring a N-anthraniloyl tryptamine scaffold that showed excellent anti-TNBC potency and promising safety profile. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of using 13c in combination with PTX in PTX-resistant TNBC was demonstrated. This study showcases N-anthraniloyl tryptamine derivatives as a novel anti-TNBC chemotype with a pharmacological mode of action targeting the USP21/JAK2/STAT3 axis and provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of TNBC.",['Long L; Xu J; Qi X; Pen Y; Wang C; Jiang W; Peng X; Hu Z; Yi W; Xie L; Lei X; Wang Z; Zhuo L'],2024,a chemoresistance regulator 13c is a characterized mechanism of TNBC progression and resistance to paclitaxel (PTX) the aberrant expression of USP21 and JAK2 represents a characterized mechanism of TNBC progression and resistance to paclitaxel (PTX)
Human insulin as both antigen and protector in type 1 diabetes.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by T-cell responses to islet antigens. Investigations in humans and the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D have revealed that T-cell reactivity to insulin plays a central role in the autoimmune response. As there is no convenient NOD-based model to study human insulin (hIns) or its T-cell epitopes in the context of spontaneous T1D, we developed a NOD mouse strain transgenically expressing hIns in islets under the control of the human regulatory region. Female NOD.hIns mice developed T1D at approximately the same rate and overall incidence as NOD mice. Islet-infiltrating T cells from NOD.hIns mice recognized hIns peptides; both CD8 and CD4 T-cell epitopes were identified. We also demonstrate that islet-infiltrating T cells from HLA-transgenic NOD.hIns mice can be used to identify potentially patient-relevant hIns T-cell epitopes. Besides serving as an antigen, hIns was expressed in the thymus of NOD.hIns mice and could serve as a protector against T1D under certain circumstances, as previously suggested by genetic studies in humans. NOD.hIns mice and related strains facilitate human-relevant epitope discovery efforts and the investigation of fundamental questions that cannot be readily addressed in humans.",['Amdare NP; Shultz LD; Greiner DL; DiLorenzo TP'],2024,hIns is a reactivity to insulin that plays a central role in the autoimmune response. female NOD.hIns mice developed T1D at approximately the same rate and overall incidence as NOD mice.
"Long-term effects of ipragliflozin and pioglitazone on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes: 5 year observational follow-up of a randomized, 24 week, active-controlled trial: Effect of ipragliflozin in MASLD.","We conducted a 5 year post-trial monitoring study of our previous randomized 24 week, open-label, active-controlled trial that showed beneficial effects of ipragliflozin on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), identical to those of pioglitazone. In our previous trial, 66 patients with MASLD and type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either ipragliflozin (n = 32) or pioglitazone (n = 34). Upon its conclusion, 61 patients were monitored for 5 years for outcome measures of MASLD, glycemic, and metabolic parameters. Differences between the two groups were analyzed at baseline, 24 weeks, and 5 years; changes in outcome measures from baseline were also evaluated. At 5 years, the mean liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio increased by 0.20 (from 0.78 ± 0.24 to 0.98 ± 0.20) in the ipragliflozin group and by 0.26 (from 0.76 ± 0.26 to 1.02 ± 0.20) in the pioglitazone group (P = 0.363). Similarly, ipragliflozin and pioglitazone significantly improved serum aminotransferase, HbA1c, and fasting plasma glucose levels over 5 years. In the ipragliflozin group, significant reductions in body weight and visceral fat area observed at 24 weeks were sustained throughout the 5 years (-4.0%, P = 0.0075 and -7.6%, P = 0.045, respectively). Moreover, ipragliflozin significantly reduced the values of fibrosis markers (serum ferritin and FIB-4 index), was well tolerated, and had a higher continuation rate for 5 years compared with pioglitazone.

Continuous glucose monitoring and recreational scuba diving in type 1 diabetes: head-to-head comparison between Free Style Libre 3 and Dexcom G7 performance.,"Background Scuba diving was previously excluded because of hypoglycemic risks for type 1 diabetic patients (T1DM). Specific eligibility criteria and a safety protocol have been defined, while continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have enhanced diabetes management. This study aims to assess the feasibility and accuracy of CGM Dexcom G7 (DG7) and Free Style Libre 3 (FSL3) in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, exploring the possibility of non-adjunctive use. Material and methods The study was conducted during an event of Diabete Sommerso® association in November 2023. Participants followed a safety protocol, with capillary glucose as reference standard (Beurer GL50Evo). Sensors accuracy was evaluated through Median and Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MeARD and MARD) and Surveillance Error Grid (SEG) Analysis. Sub-analyses were performed by glycemic range, timing, gender. Data distribution and correlation was estimated by Spearman test and Bland-Altman plots. The ability of sensors to identify hypoglycaemia was assessed by contingency tables. Participants completed a satisfation questionnaire. Results Data from 202 dives of 13 patients were collected. The overall MARD was 31% for DG7 and 14.2% for FSL3, MeARD 19.7% and 11.6% respectively. FSL3 exhibited better accuracy in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic ranges. SEG analysis showed 82.1% (DG7) and 97.4% (FSL3) data on no-risk zone. FSL3 better performed on hypoglycemia identification (diagnostic odds ratio of 254.10 vs 58.95). Neither of sensors reached the MARD for non-adjunctive use. Patient satisfaction favored FSL3 for size and minimal bulk, while DG7 received positive feedback for versatility. Conclusions The study reveals FSL3 superior accuracy compared to DG7 in a setting of repetitive scuba diving in T1DM, except for hypoglycemic range. Both sensors fails to achieve accuracy for non-adjunctive use. Capillary tests remain crucial for safe dive planning, and sensor data should be interpreted cautiously.

Enhanced angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells via THP-1-derived M2c-like macrophages and treatment with proteasome inhibitors 'bortezomib and ixazomib'.,"The leading cause of cancer-related death is lung cancer, with metastasis being the most common cause of death. To elucidate the role of macrophages in lung cancer and angiogenesis processes, we established an in vitro co-culture model of A549 or HUVEC with THP-1 cells that polarized to M2c macrophages with hydrocortisone. The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and ixazomib were investigated for their effects on proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis pathways. The effects of bortezomib and ixazomib on gene expression in gene panels, including crucial genes related to angiogenesis and proteasomes, were investigated after the co-culture model to determine these effects at the molecular level. In conclusion, bortezomib and ixazomib showed antiproliferative effects in both cells, as well as in M2c macrophage co-culture. M2c macrophages also increased invasion in A549 cells and both invasion and migration in HUVEC. mRNA expression upregulation, specifically in the NFKB and VEGF genes, supported the metastatic and angiogenic effects found in A549 and HUVEC with M2c macrophage co-culture. Additionally, bortezomib inhibited the VEGFB pathway in HUVEC and NFKB1 in A549 cells.

"Assessment of the Level of Knowledge About Risk Factors, Prevention, and Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in a Community Sample From Saudi Arabia.","Introduction Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common disease affecting pregnant females, and it carries a major risk of short and long-term health problems for both mothers and their offspring. Multiple factors like advanced maternal age, obesity, and unhealthy lifestyle can increase the risk of GDM. The current guidelines recommend screening all pregnant females for risk factors during the first trimester with subsequent testing of the blood glucose level at 24 weeks gestation. Lack of awareness about GDM is a main contributing factor in the delay in screening and diagnosis of GDM with subsequent fetal and maternal complications. This study aims to identify the level of knowledge about GDM among the adult population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Material and methods A descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted to identify the level of knowledge about risk factors, prevention, and treatment of GDM in a community sample from Saudi Arabia. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was designed, tested for validity and reliability, and distributed through social media platforms. It consisted of 18 questions asking about the socio-demographic characteristics, the type of hospital in which the participant receives their medical care, whether the participant heard about GDM or not, and if they know someone with GDM, in addition to questions to assess the level of knowledge about risk factors, complications, prevention, and treatment of GDM. The total score of knowledge was calculated. The multivariate regression analysis test was employed to analyze the relationship between various demographic variables and the level of knowledge about GDM among the study population. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 539 (100%) participants completed the questionnaire: 263 (48.8%) of them were in the age category (18-25 years), 440 (81.6%) of them were females, 307 (57%) had a bachelor's degree, 275 (51%) were single, 454 (84.2%) had heard about GDM, and 258 (47.9%) of them have or know someone with GDM. The total score of knowledge revealed excellent, good, fair, and poor levels among 334 (62%), 140 (26%), 49 (9%), and 16 (3%) of participants, respectively. The multivariable linear regression model revealed that participants who received health care from governmental hospitals heard about GDM and had or knew someone with GDM were positively associated with a higher level of knowledge. Conclusions The findings revealed that among participants, 62% showed excellent knowledge about GDM, although, the other 38% had non-optimal levels of knowledge. Awareness campaigns are recommended to improve the level of knowledge about this disease, its risk factors, treatment, and complications.",['Morsy SA; Tawfik AM; Badayyan SY; Shaikh LK; AzizKhan S; Zakari AA'],2024,the current guidelines recommend screening all pregnant females for risk factors during the first trimester with subsequent testing of the blood glucose level at 24 weeks gestation. lack of awareness about GDM is a main contributing factor in the delay in screening and diagnosis of GDM with subsequent fetal and maternal complications.
Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors for patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease and heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.,"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure (HF) with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, RASI administration rate and its association with long-term outcomes in patients with CKD complicated by HF with LVEF >40% remain unclear. We analyzed 1923 consecutive patients with LVEF >40% registered within the multicenter database for hospitalized HF. We assessed RASI administration rate and its association with all-cause mortality among patients with mild or moderate CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]: 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Exploratory subgroups included patients grouped by age (<80, ≥80 years), sex, previous HF hospitalization, B-type natriuretic peptide (higher, lower than median), eGFR (30-44, 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), systolic blood pressure (<120, ≥120 mmHg), LVEF (41-49, ≥50%), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) use. Among patients with LVEF >40%, 980 (51.0%) had mild or moderate CKD (age: 81 [74-86] years; male, 52.6%; hypertension, 69.7%; diabetes, 25.9%), and 370 (37.8%) did not receive RASI. RASI use was associated with hypertension, absence of atrial fibrillation, and MRA use. After multivariable adjustments, RASI use was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality over a 2-year median follow-up (hazard ratio: 0.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.79, P = 0.001), and the mortality rate difference was predominantly due to cardiac death, consistent in all subgroups. Approximately one-third of HF patients with mild or moderate CKD and LVEF >40% were discharged without RASI administration and demonstrated relatively guarded outcomes.",['Takeuchi S; Kohno T; Goda A; Shiraishi Y; Kitamura M; Nagatomo Y; Takei M; Nomoto M; Soejima K; Kohsaka S; Yoshikawa T'],2024,LVEF 40% and mild or moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with CKD. a study analyzed 1923 consecutive patients with LVEF >40%. a study found that a liar ejection fraction was a factor in CKD.
Accessory tympanic plate ossicle: a new osteological entity.,"The auricular cartilage, which is typically soft and flexible, can calcify or ossify because of diseases such as diabetes mellitus, trauma, radiation therapy for cancer, and more commonly from frostbite. Calcified, ossified, or hardened auricular cartilage is a rare finding in the clinical literature and appears to be absent in the physical and forensic anthropological literature. This study examines the ossified auricular cartilage and tests whether the hypothesis can be identified in postmortem skeletonized tissue and be part of the external auditory meatus. A total of 290 crania were examined for accessory ossicles. A descriptive and interpretative analysis was performed grossly, histologically, and morphometrically to document the morphology and location of the ossicles, investigate their structure, and perform hypothesis testing. Results revealed that seven females and one male crania from a total of 290 crania (2.76%) exhibit semi-ossified auricular cartilage attached to the tympanic plate of the temporal bone. The morphology and location of the ossicles at the junction of the auricle and external auditory meatus indicate they are hardened auricular cartilage that was verified with histological observations. Regression analysis indicates that addition of the ossicle to the depth of the auditory tube significantly changes coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) with respect to cranial breadth. In conclusion, results indicate that small cartilaginous structures of the external ear may ossify forming accessory tympanic plate ossicles that potentially could be identified in skeletal remains as a new osteological entity. This report highlights the types of information that can be gained using an approach that integrates forensic anthropology, gross anatomy, and histology.",['Mann RW; Ruengdit S; Thompson K; Miller K; Lozanoff S'],2024,auricular cartilage is a rare finding in the clinical literature. it is a rare finding in the clinical literature. 290 crania were examined for accessory ossicles.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors attenuate vascular calcification by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum protein thioredoxin domain containing 5 dependent osteogenic reprogramming.,"Vascular calcification is strongly linked to the development of major adverse cardiovascular events, but effective treatments are lacking. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an emerging category of oral hypoglycemic drugs that have displayed marked effects on metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including recently reported vascular medial calcification. However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors in vascular calcification have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we aimed to further determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors protect against vascular calcification and to investigate the mechanisms involved. A computed tomography angiography investigation of coronary arteries from 1554 patients with type 2 diabetes revealed that SGLT2 inhibitor use was correlated with a lower Agatston calcification score. In the vitamin D3 overdose, 5/6 nephrectomy chronic kidney disease-induced medial calcification and Western diet-induced atherosclerotic intimal calcification models, dapagliflozin (DAPA) substantially alleviated vascular calcification in the aorta. Furthermore, we showed that DAPA reduced vascular calcification via Runx2-dependent osteogenic transdifferentiation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Transcriptome profiling revealed that thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5) was involved in the attenuation of vascular calcification by DAPA. Rescue experiments showed that DAPA-induced TXNDC5 downregulation in VSMCs blocked the protective effect on vascular calcification. Furthermore, TXNDC5 downregulation disrupted protein folding-dependent Runx2 stability and promoted subsequent proteasomal degradation. Moreover, DAPA downregulated TXNDC5 expression via amelioration of oxidative stress and ATF6-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress. Consistently, the class effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on vascular calcification were validated with empagliflozin in intimal and medial calcification models. SGLT2 inhibitors ameliorate vascular calcification through blocking endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent TXNDC5 upregulation and promoting subsequent Runx2 proteasomal degradation, suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors are potentially beneficial for vascular calcification treatment and prevention.",['Wu S; Luo X; Chen Y; Wang Z; Liu X; Sun N; Zhao J; Luo W; Zhang J; Tong X; Huang L; Liu C; Qin Z'],2024,Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are emerging category of oral hypoglycemic drugs. saturday's study found saturday's study found saturday's study found saturday's study found saturday's study found saturday's study was correlated with a lower Agatston calcification score.
Incretin-based drugs decrease the incidence of prostate cancer in type 2 diabetics: A pooling-up analysis.,"Incretin-based drugs, a class of Antidiabetic medications (ADMs) used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, may affect the incidence of prostate cancer (PCa). But real-world evidence for this possible effect is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the effect of incretin-based drugs on the incidence of PCa, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for eligible studies through September 2023. Two independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction. We used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess the quality of included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. We did a meta-analysis of available trial data to calculate overall risk ratios (RRs) for PCa. A total of 1238 articles were identified in our search. After screening for eligibility, 7 high-quality studies met the criteria for meta-analysis, including 2 RCTs and 5 cohort studies, with a total of 1165,738 patients. Compared with the control group, we found that incretin-based drugs reduced the relative risk of PCa by 35% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.49; P = .0006). In subgroup analysis, the RR values for GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors were 62% (95% CI, 0.45-0.85; P = .003) and 72% (95% CI, 0.46-1.12; P = .14), respectively.

Interdisciplinary management of orofacial lesions in early childhood: paediatric alert system at University of Verona.,"Orofacial trauma (OFT) occurs frequently in children and requires thorough evaluation not only by paediatric dentists but also by all specialists involved in emergency services, particularly in cases involving children under 3 years of age, given their inability to directly participate in clinical-anamnestic evaluations. Addressing early childhood orofacial trauma resulting from maltreatment, this study explores the key role played by various healthcare professionals, including paediatric dentists, general dentists, maxillofacial surgeons, dental hygienists, and paediatricians, in the optimal management of these cases. In the event of trauma due to suspected or confirmed mistreatment, it is essential that all healthcare workers involved have precise knowledge of the appropriate course of action from both a clinical and legal point of view, guaranteeing maximum protection for the young patient. This is particularly significant as cases of mistreatment with apparently minor consequences can degenerate into situations of irreparable severity. The latest guidelines from the International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) in 2020 continue to emphasise the potential correlation between OFT and cases of abuse or violence. Recent recommendations in the literature highlight the importance of facilitating mandatory reporting of incidents to relevant authorities and improving information sharing between dental healthcare professionals and child welfare services. A new flow diagram, called Paediatric Orofacial Trauma Alert (P.O.T.A.), has been proposed at the University of Verona. This tool is specifically designed to assist specialists dealing with early childhood orofacial trauma cases by assisting them in identifying potential cases of maltreatment. In this innovative approach, the collaborative efforts of general dentists, paediatric dentists, maxillofacial surgeons, dental hygienists and paediatricians play a vital role in cases of abuse. In addition to restoring the oral health of young patients, these professionals can activate a vast network of contacts, ensuring not only optimal oral health care but also providing comprehensive support to victims. The objective is to safeguard not only the physical but also the psychological well-being of these vulnerable subjects.",['Zerman N; Zangani A; Maffeis C; Pietrobelli A; Piacentini G; Zotti F; De Manzoni R; Silva R; Cordiano A; Spinas E; Nocini PF'],2024,"paediatric dentists, general dentists, maxillofacial surgeons, dental hygienists, and paediatricians are key to achieving optimal treatment. a new flow diagram, called Paediatric Orofacial Trauma Alert, has been proposed at the university of verona."
A case of severe side effects to androgen receptor inhibitor and consequently switch to radioligand therapy in early castration resistant prostate cancer.,"The development of potent novel androgen receptor inhibitors (ARi) such as apalutamide have improved the life expectancy in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). However, some serious toxicity can occur limiting the choice of treatment in CRPCa. In our case, the patient experienced severe toxicity after initiation of apalutamide. Diagnostic PSMA-PET/CT confirmed the recurrence and tailored the treatment with <sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA-617 (RLT), a beta emitter radionuclide. RLT resulted in prolonged progression-free survival, thus postponing the commonly seen additional toxicity of chemotherapy. The case highlights the possibility of early RLT in PSMA avid tumors, a treatment with minimal side-effects.",['Tulipan A; Kratochwil C; Lilleby J; Lilleby W'],2024,the development of potent novel androgen receptor inhibitors such as apalutamide has improved the life expectancy in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). a patient experienced severe toxicity after initiation of apalutamide.
Adipose stem cells-derived small extracellular vesicles transport Thrombospondin 1 cargo to promote insulin resistance in gestational diabetes mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a highly prevalent disease and poses a significant risk to the health of pregnant women. Abdominal adipose tissue (AT) contributes to insulin resistance (IR) associated with GDM. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we developed a mouse model of GDM by subjecting mice to a high-fat diet. We collected adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) from the abdominal and inguinal regions and examined their role in inducing IR in normal tissues through the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The sEVs derived from ADSCs isolated from GDM mice (ADSC/GDM) were found to inhibit cell viability and insulin sensitivity in AML12, a normal mouse liver cell line. Through proteomic analysis, we identified high levels of the thrombospondin 1 (Thbs1) protein in the sEVs derived from ADSC/GDM. Subsequent overexpression of Thbs1 protein in AML12 cells demonstrated similar IR as observed with ADSC/GDM-derived sEVs. Mechanistically, the Thbs1 protein within the sEVs interacted with CD36 and transforming growth factor (Tgf) β receptors in AML12 cells, leading to the activation of Tgfβ/Smad2 signaling. Furthermore, the administration of LSKL, an antagonistic peptide targeting Thbs1, suppressed Thbs1 expression in ADSC/GDM-derived sEVs, thereby restoring insulin sensitivity in AML12 cells and GDM mice in vivo. These findings shed light on the intercellular transmission mechanism through which ADSCs influence hepatic insulin sensitivity and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting the Thbs1 protein within sEVs.",['Li H; Yang H; Liu J; Yang H; Gao X; Yang X; Liu Z; Qian Q'],2024,adipose tissue contributes to insulin resistance (IR) associated with GDM. the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
Adverse Events of Oral GLP-1 Receptor Agonist (Semaglutide Tablets): A Real-World Study Based on FAERS from 2019 to 2023.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have attracted much attention because of their significant hypoglycemic and weight-loss effects. Previous preparations can only be subcutaneously injected. Oral administration of GLP-1RAs semaglutide helps to broaden treatment options, but its safety in the real world still needs to be observed. This study is based on FDA adverse event reporting system (FAERS) database to mine adverse drug events (ADE) of oral semaglutide, and provide references for the clinical safe use of this drug. To analyze the signal quality of oral semaglutide, which is a drug used in the FAERS database from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2023, we collected ADE data and performed data mining by using disproportionate analysis. Then, we standardized the data and used a variety of signal-quantification techniques, including reported odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio (PRR), Bayesian belief propagation neural network (BCPNN), and multiple empirical Bayesian gamma Poisson contractions (MGPS), for further analysis. We screened 2398 reports on the use of semaglutide tablets, involving a total of 5653 ADE. These reports were mainly submitted by consumers, and the reporting country was mainly the United States. A total of 23 system organ classes (SOC) and 93 preferred terms (PT) were mined for the signals of semaglutide tablets. The three most common SOC were gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, and investigations. At the PT level, metabolism and nutrition disorders exhibit the highest number of signals, with the top three being thyroid cyst, acute cholecystitis, and ketosis. Gastrointestinal disorders rank second, primarily involving eructation, pancreatitis, impaired gastric emptying, and regurgitation. In addition, vith nerve paralysis occurs and the signal intensity is high. Our study provides a deeper and broader understanding of the safety of oral semaglutide. The results of the ROR, PRR, BCPNN, and MGPS algorithms exhibit high consistency, with metabolism and nutrition-related disorders having the highest number of signals. The conclusions align with the technical specifications of the product. Notably, other unexpected effects are reported, including acute cholecystitis, paralysis of the abducens nerve, and positional vertigo.",['Xiong S; Gou R; Liang X; Wu H; Qin S; Li B; Luo C; Chen J'],2024,glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have attracted much attention because of their significant hypoglycemic and weight-loss effects. previous preparations can only be subcutaneously injected. but its safety in the real world still needs to be observed.
Bridging Differences in Cohort Analyses of the Relationship between Secondhand Smoke Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth Weight: The Transportability Framework in the ECHO Program.,"Estimates for the effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes, including secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure, often present considerable variability across studies. Knowledge of the reasons behind these differences can aid our understanding of effects in specific populations as well as inform practices of combining data from multiple studies. This study aimed to assess the presence of effect modification by measured sociodemographic characteristics on the effect of SHS exposure during pregnancy on birth weights that may drive differences observed across cohorts. We also aimed to quantify the extent to which differences in the cohort mean effects observed across cohorts in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) consortium are due to differing distributions of these characteristics. We assessed the presence of effect modification and transportability of effect estimates across five ECHO cohorts in a total of 6,771 mother-offspring dyads. We assessed the presence of effect modification via gradient boosting of regression trees based on the H-statistic. We estimated individual cohort effects using linear models and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). We then estimated transported effects from one cohort to each of the remaining cohorts using a robust nonparametric estimation approach relying on TMLE estimators and compared them to the original effect estimates for these cohorts. Observed effect estimates varied across the five cohorts, ranging from significantly lower birth weight associated with exposure [<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>167.3</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>g</mi></mrow></math>; 95% confidence interval (CI): <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>270.4</mn></mrow></math>, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>64.1</mn></mrow></math>] to higher birth weight with wide CIs, including the null (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mn>42.4</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>g</mi></mrow></math>; 95% CI: <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>15.0</mn></mrow></math>, 99.8). Transported effect estimates only minimally explained differences in the point estimates for two out of the four cohort pairs.

We aimed to share the clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings and treatment processes of our patients with TB-COVID-19 coinfection in our tertiary reference hospital. Patients aged 18 years and over and hospitalized in the tuberculosis service between March 2020 and September 2022 were included. All coinfected patients whose COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction results were positive while receiving tuberculosis treatment or who were diagnosed with tuberculosis while receiving treatment for COVID-19 were included. The number of patients was 39; 61.6% of males; the mean age was 52 ± 17.1 years; 20% were foreign nationals; 92.5% were Asian; 69.5% had a bacteriological diagnosis; 84.6% had pulmonary tuberculosis; 10% had received antituberculosis treatment before; and 87.5% were sensitive to the first-line antituberculosis drugs.

Outcomes and patterns of use of Radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Radium-223 dichloride (Ra-223) is recommended as a treatment option for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral disease, after docetaxel failure, or in patients who are not candidates to receive it. In this study, we aimed to ambispectively analyze overall survival (OS) and prognostic features in mCRPC in patients receiving Ra-223 as per clinical routine practice and identify the most suitable treatment sequence. This study is observational, multicentric, and ambispective. Eligibility criteria included mCRPC patients treated with Ra-223, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, without visceral metastases, and no more than three cm involved lymph nodes. A total of 145 patients were included; the median age was 73.97 years, and a Gleason score of more than or equal to 7 in 61 (48%) patients; 73 (81%) had previously received docetaxel. The most important benefit was reached by those patients who received Ra-223 in the second-line setting, with a median OS of 17 months (95% CI, 12-21), and by patients who received six cycles of treatment, with a median OS of 19 months (95% CI, 14-21). An alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decrease was also identified as a prognosis marker. When performing the multivariate analysis, the time to develop castration-resistant disease longer than 24 months was the most important prognostic factor to predict the evolution of the patients receiving Ra-223. Ra-223 was well tolerated, with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and diarrhea being the main adverse events. There is a benefit for those patients who received Ra-223 in the second-line setting, regardless of prior use of docetaxel.

Adequacy and Acceptability of the Self-Collected Anal Pap Smear in People Living With Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the Infectious Diseases Clinic.,"Background Anal Pap smears are imperative to screening for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anal squamous cell cancers, particularly in patients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) given a higher incidence of disease. Self-collection of specimens may be favored by patients and more feasible to collect, increasing screening. Methods This was a single-center observational cohort study at a single academic medical center Infectious Diseases clinic from October to December 2021. We aimed to improve compliance of anal Pap collection documentation of ""self-collected"" versus ""physician-collected"" as well as verify if self-collected specimens (SCS) were adequate for interpretation equivalent to physician-collected specimens (PCS). Additionally, we aimed to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with self-collected anal Paps. Results Sixty anal Pap smears were available for evaluation. The rate of documentation of the collection method (self-collected vs. physician-collected) was 88% during the intervention. A total of 75% of patients opted for self-collection, and 35/45 (78%) of these samples were adequate for interpretation. There was no difference in the adequacy of specimen (the ability of a cytopathologist to interpret the specimen) between the SCS and PCS. Conclusion Limited prior data suggest self-collected anal Pap specimens are adequate for interpretation only slightly less often than PCS. In our small cohort, there was no statistically significant difference between collection methods. Satisfaction with self-collection of specimens was high for both patients and providers. Additional validation in more diverse/larger clinical settings may be helpful to support this practice.",['Villa-Chan F; Wark K; Kubat R; Newman JR'],2024,anal papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anal squamous cell cancers are a major factor. self-collection of specimens may be favored by patients and more feasible to collect. a single-center observational cohort study at a single academic medical center infectious Diseases clinic from October to December 2021.
Intensity-Modulated Reirradiation Therapy With Nivolumab in Recurrent or Second Primary Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.,"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) reirradiation of nonmetastatic recurrent or second primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) results in poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). To investigate the tolerability, PFS, OS, and patient-reported outcomes with nivolumab (approved standard of care for patients with HNSCC) during and after IMRT reirradiation. In this multicenter nonrandomized phase 2 single-arm trial, the treatment outcomes of patients with recurrent or second primary HNSCC who satisfied recursive partitioning analysis class 1 and 2 definitions were evaluated. Between July 11, 2018, and August 12, 2021, 62 patients were consented and screened. Data were evaluated between June and December 2023. Sixty- to 66-Gy IMRT in 30 to 33 daily fractions over 6 to 6.5 weeks with nivolumab, 240 mg, intravenously 2 weeks prior and every 2 weeks for 5 cycles during IMRT, then nivolumab, 480 mg, intravenously every 4 weeks for a total nivolumab duration of 52 weeks. The primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included OS, incidence, and types of toxic effects, including long-term treatment-related toxic effects, patient-reported outcomes, and correlatives of tissue and blood biomarkers. A total of 62 patients were screened, and 51 were evaluable (median [range] age was 62 [56-67] years; 42 [82%] were male; 6 [12%] had p16+ disease; 38 [75%] had salvage surgery; and 36 [71%.] had neck dissection). With a median follow-up of 24.5 months (95% CI, 19.0-25.0), the estimated 1-year PFS was 61.7% (95% CI, 49.2%-77.4%), rejecting the null hypothesis of 1-year PFS rate of less than 43.8% with 1-arm log-rank test P = .002 within a 1-year timeframe. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse event (6 [12%]) was lymphopenia with 2 patients (4%) and 1 patient each (2%) exhibiting colitis, diarrhea, myositis, nausea, mucositis, and myasthenia gravis. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck Questionnaire quality of life scores remained stable and consistent across all time points.

Impact of Poverty on Stroke Recurrence: A Population-Based Study.,"Poverty is associated with greater stroke incidence. The relationship between poverty and stroke recurrence is less clear. In this population-based study, incident strokes within the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region were ascertained during the 2015 study period and followed up for recurrence until December 31, 2018. The primary exposure was neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), defined by the percentage of households below the federal poverty line in each census tract in 4 categories (≤5%, >5%-10%, >10%-25%, >25%). Poisson regression models provided recurrence rate estimates per 100,000 residents using population data from the 2015 5-year American Community Survey, adjusting for age, sex, and race. In a secondary analysis, Cox models allowed for the inclusion of vascular risk factors in the assessment of recurrence risk by nSES among those with incident stroke. Of 2,125 patients with incident stroke, 245 had a recurrent stroke during the study period. Poorer nSES was associated with increased stroke recurrence, with rates of 12.5, 17.5, 25.4, and 29.9 per 100,000 in census tracts with ≤5%, >5%-10%, >10%-25%, and >25% below the poverty line, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The relative risk (95% CI) for recurrent stroke among Black vs White individuals was 2.54 (1.91-3.37) before adjusting for nSES, and 2.00 (1.47-2.74) after adjusting for nSES, a 35.1% decrease. In the secondary analysis, poorer nSES (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.10-2.76 for lowest vs highest category) and Black race (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70) were both independently associated with recurrence risk, though neither retained significance after full adjustment. Age, diabetes, and left ventricular hypertrophy were associated with increased recurrence risk in fully adjusted models. Residents of poorer neighborhoods had a dose-dependent increase in stroke recurrence risk, and neighborhood poverty accounted for approximately one-third of the excess risk among Black individuals. These results highlight the importance of poverty, race, and the intersection of the 2 as potent drivers of stroke recurrence.",['Becker CJ; Sucharew H; Robinson D; Stamm B; Royan R; Nobel L; Stanton RJ; Jasne AS; Woo D; De Los Rios La Rosa F; Mackey J; Ferioli S; Mistry EA; Demel S; Haverbusch M; Coleman E; Slavin S; Walsh KB; Star M; Flaherty ML; Martini SR; Kissela B; Kleindorfer D'],2024,"incident strokes in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region were ascertained during the 2015 study period. the primary exposure was neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) of 2,125 patients with incident stroke, 245 had a recurrent stroke during the study period."
Subtotal esophagectomy and concurrent reconstruction with free jejunal flap for primary esophageal cancer after pancreatoduodenectomy.,"Pancreatoduodenectomy and subtotal esophagectomy are widely considered the most invasive and difficult surgical procedures in gastrointestinal surgery. Subtotal esophagectomy after pancreatoduodenectomy is expected to be extremely difficult due to complicated anatomical changes, and selecting an appropriate intestinal reconstruction method will also be a difficult task. Therefore, perhaps because the method is considered impossible, there have been few reports of subtotal esophagectomy after pancreatoduodenectomy. A 73-year-old man with a history of pancreatoduodenectomy was diagnosed with superficial thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Definitive chemoradiation therapy was recommended at another hospital; however, he visited our department to undergo surgery. We performed the robot-assisted thoracoscopic subtotal esophagectomy. There were some difficulties with the reconstruction: the gastric tube could not be used, the reconstruction was long, and the organs reconstructed in the previous surgery had to be preserved. However, the concurrent reconstruction was achieved with the help of a free jejunal flap and vascular reconstruction. All reconstructions from the previous surgery, including the remnant stomach, were preserved via regional abdominal lymph node dissection. After reconstruction, intravenous indocyanine green showed that circulation in the reconstructed intestines was preserved. On postoperative day 1, no recurrent nerve paralysis was observed during laryngoscopy. The patient could start oral intake smoothly 2 weeks after surgery and did not exhibit any postoperative complications related to the reconstruction. The patient was transferred to another hospital on postoperative day 21. Owing to the free jejunal flap interposition method, we safely performed one stage subtotal esophagectomy and concurrent reconstruction, preservation of the remnant stomach, and pancreaticobiliary reconstruction in patients with a history of pancreatoduodenectomy. We believe that this method is acceptable and useful for patients undergoing complicated reconstruction.",['Moriwake K; Noma K; Kawasaki K; Matsumoto T; Hashimoto M; Kato T; Maeda N; Tanabe S; Shirakawa Y; Fujiwara T'],2024,pancreatoduodenectomy is expected to be extremely difficult due to complicated anatomical changes. 73-year-old man diagnosed with superficial thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. chemoradiation therapy was recommended at another hospital.
Long-Term therapy with CFTR modulators consistently improves glucose metabolism in adolescents and adults with Cystic Fibrosis.,"Impaired glycemic control and the subsequent development of Cystic fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) are prevalent complications, affecting up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR modulator (CFTRm) therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) and appear to have a positive effect on extrapulmonary manifestations, such as nutritional state, improvements in upper respiratory symptoms, and quality of life. Initial findings indicate that CFTRm may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control; however, long-term effects remain uncertain at present. In this retrospective study, data were collected and analyzed on 15 pwCF, ages 13-37 years, started on CFTRm therapy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) results were compared pre- and post-CFTRm therapy. The 120-minute OGTT value decreased from 159.7 to 130.4 post-CFTRm (p = 0.047). The average time elapsed between the two OGTT tests was 49.87 months (ranging 9-157 months, median 38 months). Glycemic status improved in six pwCF (two CFRD to normal (NGT)/indeterminate (INDET) glucose tolerance; two impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to INDET; two INDET to NGT) and worsened in one (IGT to CFRD). Six pwCF and NGT remained stable with no changes in glycemic statues throughout the follow-up period. CFTRm therapy may decelerate the glycemic control deterioration in pwCF over an extended period. These findings indicate the need for periodic OGTTs following the initiation of CFTRm therapy to appropriately adjust insulin requirements and prevent hypoglycemia. Further larger cohorts are required to authenticate and substantiate these findings.",['Cohen A; Mass A; Reiter J; Zangen DH; Cohen-Cymberknoh M'],2024,"CFTR modulator therapies improve pulmonary functions, reduce exacerbation rates, increase survival in people with CF (pwCF) CFTRm therapy may have a positive impact on short-term glycemic control."
"Mortality rates, cause and risk factors in people with spina bifida, register-based study over five decades.","Care for people with spina bifida can be improved. This may be done by evaluating mortality rates and causes of death. Between 1973 and 2021, 1735 people with spina bifida appeared in registers of the Swedish population. Survival rates and causes of death were calculated according to age and decade. Over almost 50 years, the prevalence of spina bifida decreased from 5.2 to 1.2 per 10 000 births. Mortality fell sharply during the first year of life, with survival rising from 75% to 94%. For children aged 2-18 years and adults, mortality rates were low and differences between decades were minimal. Causes of childhood deaths were congenital abnormalities, hydrocephalus and infections, the latter two also in adults. Adult causes also included self-inflicted injuries and substance abuse, with suicidal or unclear intent, both more common than in the general population. Bladder malignancies were also more frequent, although after reconstructive bladder surgery, mortality rates were similar. Survival in the first year of life increased in children with spina bifida, whereas there was no difference in survival rates between adults born between 1973 and 1999. For adults, proactive prevention methods regarding self-inflicted injury, substance abuse and bladder cancer are warranted.",['Andersson M; Hadi L; Dellenmark M; Sillen U; Sjöström S; Arnell MVM; Abrahamsson K'],2024,"between 1973 and 2021, 1735 people with spina bifida appeared in registers of the Swedish population. survival rates and causes of death were calculated according to age and decade."
Plasma ctDNA enhances the tissue-based detection of oncodriver mutations in colorectal cancer.,"The advent of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technology has provided a convenient and noninvasive means to continuously monitor cancer genomic data, facilitating personalized cancer treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the supplementary benefits of plasma ctDNA alongside traditional tissue-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) in identifying targetable mutations and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancers (CRC). Our study involved 76 CRC patients, collecting both tissue and plasma samples for NGS. We assessed the concordance of gene mutational status between ctDNA and tissue, focusing on actionable genes such as KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, and ERBB2. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore variables associated with discordance and positive mutation rates. In total, 26 cancer-related genes were identified. The most common variants in tumor tissues and plasma samples were in APC (57.9% vs 19.7%), TP53 (55.3% vs 22.4%) and KRAS (47.4% vs 43.4%). Tissue and ctDNA showed an overall concordance of 73.53% in detecting actionable gene mutations. Notably, plasma ctDNA improved detection for certain genes and gene pools. Variables significantly associated with discordance included gender and peritoneal metastases. TMB analysis revealed a higher detection rate in tissues compared to plasma, but combining both increased detection. Our study highlights the importance of analyzing both tissue and plasma for detecting actionable mutations in CRC, with plasma ctDNA offering added value. Discordance is associated with gender and peritoneal metastases, and TMB analysis can benefit from a combination of tissue and plasma data. This approach provides valuable insights for personalized CRC treatment.",['Wang W; Huang Y; Kong J; Lu L; Liao Q; Zhu J; Wang T; Yan L; Dai M; Chen Z; You J'],2024,circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technology provides a convenient and noninvasive means to continuously monitor cancer genomic data. this study aims to evaluate the benefits of plasma ctDNA alongside traditional tissue-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) in identifying targetable mutations and tumor mutational burden (TMB) in colorectal cancers.
Intervention to increase colorectal cancer screening among emergency department patients: results from a randomised pilot study.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Emergency departments (ED) represent a promising setting to address preventive health measures like CRC screening. The current study adapted an existing cervical cancer screening intervention for use in catalysing CRC screening. We evaluated feasibility of identification, provided preliminary effect size estimates and documented participant acceptability. This study was funded by the University of Rochester (ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT05004376). We enrolled ED patients, 45-75 years old, in the Greater Rochester, NY region into a randomised controlled pilot from January to May 2022. Patients were excluded if non-English speaking, lacking a cell phone or had a history of CRC, colorectal resection, inflammatory bowel disease or abdominal radiation. Participants were surveyed to determine adherence with recommended CRC screening guidelines. Patients found non-adherent were randomised to receive (1) recommendation for CRC screening only or (2) recommendation and a text-based intervention aimed at generating intention and motivation to get screened. Patients were blind to allocation at enrolment. The primary outcome was patient CRC screening or scheduling. 1438 patients were approached, with 609 found ineligible, 576 declining participation and 253 enrolled. A randomised sample of 114 non-adherent patients were split evenly between the control and intervention arms. Among participants with follow-up data (<i>n</i> <sub>control</sub>=38, <i>n</i> <sub>intervention</sub>=36), intervention participants had a 2%-3% higher rate of scheduling or receiving screening (7%-27% relative improvement). When using the complete sample (n=114) and conservatively assuming no screening for those lost to follow-up, differences in screening across arms were mildly decreased (0%-2% absolute difference). Acceptability of CRC intervention was high, and participants offered formative feedback. The piloted text message intervention through the ED shows potential promise for catalysing CRC screening. Subsequent replication in a fully powered trial is needed.",['Abar B; Park CS; Wood N; Marino D; Fiscella K; Adler D'],2024,ED patients were randomlyised to receive recommendation for CRC screening only or (2) recommendation. patients were blind to allocation at enrolment.
Nucleoporin Nup98 is an essential factor for ipo4 dependent protein import.,"Nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules is essential in eukaryotic cells. In this process, the karyopherins play a central role when they transport cargoes across the nuclear pore complex. Importin 4 belongs to the karyopherin β family. Many studies have focused on finding substrates for importin 4, but no direct mechanism studies of its precise transport function have been reported. Therefore, this paper mainly aimed to study the mechanism of nucleoporins in mediating nuclear import and export of importin 4. To address this question, we constructed shRNAs targeting Nup358, Nup153, Nup98, and Nup50. We found that depletion of Nup98 resulted in a shift in the subcellular localization of importin 4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Mutational analysis demonstrated that Nup98 physically and functionally interacts with importin 4 through its N-terminal phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat region. Mutation of nine of these FG motifs to SG motifs significantly attenuated the binding of Nup98 to importin 4, and we further confirmed the essential role of the six FG motifs in amino acids 121-360 of Nup98 in binding with importin 4. In vitro transport assay also confirmed that VDR, the substrate of importin 4, could not be transported into the nucleus after Nup98 knockdown. Overall, our results showed that Nup98 is required for efficient importin 4-mediated transport. This is the first study to reveal the mechanism of importin 4 in transporting substrates into the nucleus.",['Guo Y; Tao T; Wu T; Hou J; Lin W'],2024,karyopherins play a central role when they transport cargoes across the nuclear pore complex. many studies have focused on finding substrates for importin 4. no direct mechanism studies of its precise transport function have been reported.
Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma: from genesis to molecular pathways and therapeutic strategies.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) are the most common primary liver cancers. Little is known about the combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) variant and the proper therapeutic strategies. Out of over 1200 available studies about cHCC-ICC, we selected the most representative ones that reflected updated information with application to individualized therapy. Based on literature data and own experience, we hypothesize that two molecular groups of cHCC-ICC can be identified. The proposed division might have a significant therapeutic role. Most cases develop, like HCC, on a background of cirrhosis and hepatitis and share characteristics with HCC; thus, they are named HCC-type cHCC-ICC and therapeutic strategies might be like those for HCC. This review also highlights a new carcinogenic perspective and identifies, based on literature data and the own experience, a second variant of cHCC-ICC called ICC-type cHCC-ICC. Contrary to HCC, these cases show a tendency for lymph node metastases and ICC components in the metastatic tissues. No guidelines have been established yet for such cases. Individualized therapy should be, however, oriented toward the immunoprofile of the primary tumor and metastatic cells, and different therapeutic strategies should be used in patients with HCC- versus ICC-type cHCC-ICC.",['Gurzu S; Szodorai R; Jung I; Banias L'],2024,cHCC-ICC is the most common primary liver cancer. cHCC-ICC is a combination of hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma. cHCC-ICC is a cHCC-type variant.
"Dental service use among adults with incident type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease.","It is not clear if or how the incidence of systemic conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM<sub>2</sub>), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects dental service utilization. Using nationwide Danish register data, the aim of this study was to analyse the use of dental services 7 years before and after being diagnosed with DM<sub>2</sub>, RA or IBD between 1997 and 2011. Information about incident DM<sub>2</sub> was obtained from the National Diabetes Register, and incident RA and IBD were defined based on diagnosis codes of hospital contacts identified through the National Patient Register. Separately, for each of the three conditions, each individual with the incident condition was matched to one control individual based on age, gender, country of origin, municipality of residence, highest completed education, the main source of income and income using coarsened exact matching in the year of incidence. The use of dental services and treatments received within each calendar year from 7 years before to 7 years after getting the condition were analysed with generalized estimating equations. People with incident DM<sub>2</sub> were less likely (by seven percentage points) to be dental service users within a year than people without incident DM<sub>2</sub> for a period extending from up to 7 years prior to 7 years after the diagnosis. This difference even slightly increased after the diagnosis. Those with incident IBD exhibited a consistently but modestly higher proportion of dental service use (three percentage points) than those without incident IBD before and after the diagnosis. Differences in the use of services between those with or without incident RA were minor. For all three systemic diseases, detected differences mainly mirrored differences in the provision of supragingival scaling and restorative treatment. The findings suggest that the impact of these three systemic conditions on dental service use was minor.",['Raittio E; Baelum V; Nascimento GG; Lopez R'],2024,"a study was carried out by the national diabetes register. it was used to analyse the use of dental services 7 years before and after being diagnosed with DMsub>2/sub>, RA or IBD. the study was based on diagnosis codes of hospital contacts identified through the national patient register."
LDHA-mediated M2-type macrophage polarization via tumor-derived exosomal EPHA2 promotes renal cell carcinoma progression.,"Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) is known to promote the growth and invasion of various types of tumors, affects tumor resistance, and is associated with tumor immune escape. But how LDHA reshapes the tumor microenvironment and promotes the progression of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. In this study, we found that LDHA was highly expressed in clear cell RCC (ccRCC), and this high expression was associated with macrophage infiltration, while macrophages were highly infiltrated in ccRCC, affecting patient prognosis via M2-type polarization. Our in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that LDHA and M2-type macrophages could enhance the proliferation, invasion, and migration abilities of ccRCC cells. Mechanistically, high expression of LDHA in ccRCC cells upregulated the expression of EPHA2 in exosomes derived from renal cancer. Exosomal EPHA2 promoted M2-type polarization of macrophages by promoting activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in macrophages, thereby promoting the progression of ccRCC. All these findings suggest that EPHA2 may prove to be a potential therapeutic target for advanced RCC.",['Gan X; Hu J; Pang Q; Yan R; Bao Y; Liu Y; Song J; Wang Z; Sun W; Huang F; Cai C; Wang L'],2024,"LDHA was highly expressed in clear cell RCC (ccRCC). this high expression was associated with macrophage infiltration. macrophages were highly infiltrated in ccRCC, affecting patient prognosis."
"Association of High apoB/apoA1 Ratio with Increased Erythrocytes, Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratio, D-dimer, Uric Acid and Cardiac Remodeling in Elderly Heart Failure Patients: A Retrospective Study.","Previous studies have confirmed that high apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (apoB/apoA1) ratio was associated with increased mortality from heart failure (HF). Furthermore, the association of plasma apoB/apoA1 ratio with clinical characteristics and adverse cardiac remodeling is still limited in chronic HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) elderly patients. Therefore, this study investigated the association of apoB/apoA1 ratio with clinical characteristics and adverse cardiac remodeling in chronic HFmrEF elderly patients. A total of 587 Chinese elderly (≥65 years) with coronary heart disease (CHD), HFmrEF (EF 40-50%) and related blood biochemical data were collected retrospectively. The cross-sectional data of echocardiographic and blood parameters were compared between binary apoB/apoA1 groups. In the elderly CHD patients with chronic HFmrEF, the univariate correlation analysis showed that apoB/apoA1 was correlated with younger age, increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes, erythrocytes, platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), D-dimer, fibrinogen, high sensitivity C-reactive protein and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling (All <i>P</i> < 0.05). However, multivariate logistic binary regression analysis found that high apoB/apoA1 ratio (≥0.62) was independently correlated with younger age, increased erythrocytes, PLR, D-dimer and uric acid, and adverse cardiac remodeling (All <i>P</i> < 0.05).

Machine learning-assisted SERS approach enables the biochemical discrimination in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 expressing yeast cells treated with ketoconazole and fluconazole antifungals.,"Antifungal medications are important due to their potential application in cancer treatment either on their own or with traditional treatments. The mechanisms that prevent the effects of these medications and restrict their usage in cancer treatment are not completely understood. The evaluation and discrimination of the possible protective effects of the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, critical regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis, against antifungal drug-induced cell death has still scientific uncertainties that must be considered. Novel, simple, and reliable strategies are highly demanded to identify the biochemical signature of this phenomenon. However, the complex nature of cells poses challenges for the analysis of cellular biochemical changes or classification. In this study, for the first time, we investigated the probable protective activities of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins against cell damage induced by ketoconazole (KET) and fluconazole (FLU) antifungal drugs in a yeast model through surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) approach. The proposed SERS platform created robust Raman spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio. The analysis of SERS spectral data via advanced unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods enabled unquestionable differentiation (100 %) in samples and biomolecular identification. Various SERS bands related to lipids and proteins observed in the analyses suggest that the expression of these anti-apoptotic proteins reduces oxidative biomolecule damage induced by the antifungals. Also, cell viability assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, and total oxidant and antioxidant status analyses were performed to support Raman measurements. We strongly believe that the proposed approach paves the way for the evaluation of various biochemical structures/changes in various cells.",['Guler A; Yilmaz A; Oncer N; Sever NI; Cengiz Sahin S; Kavakcıoglu Yardimci B; Yilmaz M'],2024,antifungal medications are important due to their potential application in cancer treatment. the mechanisms that prevent the effects of these medications are not completely understood. the complex nature of cells poses challenges for the analysis of cellular biochemical changes or classification.
The gut-airway microbiome axis in health and respiratory diseases.,"Communication between the gut and remote organs, such as the brain or the cardiovascular system, has been well established and recent studies provide evidence for a potential bidirectional gut-airway axis. Observations from animal and human studies indicate that respiratory insults influence the activity of the gut microbiome and that microbial ligands and metabolic products generated by the gut microbiome shape respiratory immunity. Information exchange between these two large mucosal surface areas regulates microorganism-immune interactions, with significant implications for the clinical and treatment outcomes of a range of respiratory conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. In this Review, we summarize the most recent data in this field, offering insights into mechanisms of gut-airway crosstalk across spatial and temporal gradients and their relevance for respiratory health.",['Özçam M; Lynch SV'],2024,communication between the gut and remote organs has been well established. observations from animal and human studies indicate that respiratory insults influence the activity of the gut microbiome. microbial ligands and metabolic products generated by the gut microbiome shape respiratory immunity.
Spatial distance between tumor and lymphocyte can predict the survival of patients with resectable lung adenocarcinoma.,"Spatial interaction between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor cells is valuable in predicting the effectiveness of immune response and prognosis amongst patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Recent evidence suggests that the spatial distance between tumor cells and lymphocytes also influences the immune responses, but the distance analysis based on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) -stained whole-slide images (WSIs) remains insufficient. To address this issue, we aim to explore the relationship between distance and prognosis prediction of patients with LUAD in this study. We recruited patients with resectable LUAD from three independent cohorts in this multi-center study. We proposed a simple but effective deep learning-driven workflow to automatically segment different cell types in the tumor region using the HoVer-Net model, and quantified the spatial distance (DIST) between tumor cells and lymphocytes based on H&E-stained WSIs. The association of DIST with disease-free survival (DFS) was explored in the discovery set (D1, n = 276) and the two validation sets (V1, n = 139; V2, n = 115). In multivariable analysis, the low DIST group was associated with significantly better DFS in the discovery set (D1, HR, 0.61; 95 % CI, 0.40-0.94; p = 0.027) and the two validation sets (V1, HR, 0.54; 95 % CI, 0.32-0.91; p = 0.022; V2, HR, 0.44; 95 % CI, 0.24-0.81; p = 0.009). By integrating the DIST with clinicopathological factors, the integrated model (full model) had better discrimination for DFS in the discovery set (C-index, D1, 0.745 vs. 0.723) and the two validation sets (V1, 0.621 vs. 0.596; V2, 0.671 vs. 0.650). Furthermore, the computerized DIST was associated with immune phenotypes such as immune-desert and inflamed phenotypes. The integration of DIST with clinicopathological factors could improve the stratification performance of patients with resectable LUAD, was beneficial for the prognosis prediction of LUAD patients, and was also expected to assist physicians in individualized treatment.",['Pan X; Feng S; Wang Y; Chen J; Lin H; Wang Z; Hou F; Lu C; Chen X; Liu Z; Li Z; Cui Y; Liu Z'],2024,"a multivariable analysis of the association of DIST with disease-free survival (DFS) was conducted in the discovery set (D1, n = 276) and the two validation sets (V1, n = 139; V2, n = 115) the distance analysis based on H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) remains insufficient."
Visualizing the active site oxyanion loop transition upon ensitrelvir binding and transient dimerization of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.,"N-terminal autoprocessing from its polyprotein precursor enables creating the mature-like stable dimer interface of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (MPro), concomitant with the active site oxyanion loop equilibrium transitioning to the active conformation (E*) and onset of catalytic activity. Through mutagenesis of critical interface residues and evaluating noncovalent inhibitor (ensitrelvir, ESV) facilitated dimerization through its weak binding to MPro, we demonstrate that residues extending from Ser1 through Glu14 are critical for dimerization. Combined mutations G11A, E290A and R298A (MPro<sup>TM</sup>) restrict dimerization even upon binding of ESV to monomeric MPro<sup>TM</sup> with an inhibitor dissociation constant of 7.4 ± 1.6 µM. Contrasting the covalent inhibitor NMV or GC373 binding to monomeric MPro, ESV binding enabled capturing the transition of the oxyanion loop conformations in the absence of a reactive warhead and independent of dimerization. Characterization of complexes by room-temperature X-ray crystallography reveals ESV bound to the E* state of monomeric MPro as well as an intermediate approaching the inactive state (E). It appears that the E* to E equilibrium shift occurs initially from G138-F140 residues, leading to the unwinding of the loop and formation of the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. Finally, we describe a transient dimer structure of the MPro precursor held together through interactions of residues A5-G11 with distinct states of the active sites, E and E*, likely representing an intermediate in the autoprocessing pathway.",['Kovalevsky A; Aniana A; Coates L; Ghirlando R; Nashed NT; Louis JM'],2024,"mutagenesis of critical interface residues and evaluating noncovalent inhibitor (ensitrelvir, ESV) facilitated dimerization through its weak binding to MPro. residues extending from Ser1 through Glu14 are critical for dimerization."
Genome-wide Cas9-mediated screening of essential non-coding regulatory elements via libraries of paired single-guide RNAs.,"The functions of non-coding regulatory elements (NCREs), which constitute a major fraction of the human genome, have not been systematically studied. Here we report a method involving libraries of paired single-guide RNAs targeting both ends of an NCRE as a screening system for the Cas9-mediated deletion of thousands of NCREs genome-wide to study their functions in distinct biological contexts. By using K562 and 293T cell lines and human embryonic stem cells, we show that NCREs can have redundant functions, and that many ultra-conserved elements have silencer activity and play essential roles in cell growth and in cellular responses to drugs (notably, the ultra-conserved element PAX6_Tarzan may be critical for heart development, as removing it from human embryonic stem cells led to defects in cardiomyocyte differentiation). The high-throughput screen, which is compatible with single-cell sequencing, may allow for the identification of druggable NCREs.",['Li Y; Tan M; Akkari-Henić A; Zhang L; Kip M; Sun S; Sepers JJ; Xu N; Ariyurek Y; Kloet SL; Davis RP; Mikkers H; Gruber JJ; Snyder MP; Li X; Pang B'],2024,paired single-guide RNAs target both ends of an NCRE. this is a screening system for the deletion of thousands of NCREs. this is a result of a lack of coding regulatory elements.
Exploring the risk of second primary malignancies in laryngeal cancer survivors: insights from the SEER database.,"We intended to investigate the risk for second primary malignancy (SPM) development in Laryngeal Cancer (LC) survivors. We conducted a population-based analysis of SPM risk using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Data of selected LC survivors from the SEER database between 2000 and 2020 were examined. Standardized Incidence ratios (SIRs) for SPM development were calculated, followed by detailed stratification according to anatomical site and different latency periods. A total of 8413 SPMs were observed in our extracted cohort. The collective standardized incidence of SPMs was 2.12 (95% CI 2.07-2.17) compared to the US population, with an absolute excess risk (AER) of 201.73 per 10,000 individuals. The highest SPM risks were observed in patients with young age at diagnosis, females, and American Indians/Alaska natives. Increased SPM risks were reported in patients receiving all modalities of treatment including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Most SPMs were detected in solid organs such as the lungs and bronchus, oral cavity and pharynx, and prostate. The highest increased risks of developing SPMs were observed in Trachea, larynx, oral cavity and pharynx, lung and bronchus, and esophagus.

Development and validation of a novel nomogram for predicting good neoangiogenesis after encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis in patients with moyamoya disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a case-control study.,"Diabetes is often linked to poorer outcomes in patients with moyamoya disease (MMD). However, experience has shown that certain individuals with diabetes have favorable outcomes after encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS). The authors aimed to develop a nomogram to predict good neoangiogenesis in patients with MMD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to aid neurosurgeons in the identification of suitable candidates for EDAS. Adults with MMD and T2DM who underwent EDAS between June 2004 and December 2018 were included in the analysis. In total, 126 patients (213 hemispheres) with MMD and T2DM from the Fifth Medical Centre of the Chinese PLA General Hospital were included and randomly divided into training (152 hemispheres) and internal validation (61 hemispheres) cohorts at a ratio of 7:3. Univariate logistic and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses were used to identify the significant factors associated with good neoangiogenesis, which were used to develop a nomogram. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were assessed. A total of 213 hemispheres in 126 patients were reviewed, including 152 (71.36%) hemispheres with good postoperative collateral formation and 61 (28.64%) with poor postoperative collateral formation. The authors selected 4 predictors (FGD5 rs11128722, VEGFA rs9472135, Suzuki stage, and internal carotid artery [ICA] moyamoya vessels) for nomogram development. The C-indices of the nomogram in the training and internal validation cohorts were 0.873 and 0.841, respectively. The nomogram exhibited a sensitivity of 84.5% and specificity of 81.0%. The positive and negative predictive values were 92.1% and 66.7%, respectively. The calibration curves indicated high predictive accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed the superiority of the nomogram. The decision-making analysis validated the fitness and clinical application value of this nomogram. Then a web-based calculator to facilitate clinical application was generated. The nomogram developed in this study accurately predicted neoangiogenesis in patients with MMD and T2DM after EDAS and may assist neurosurgeons in identifying suitable candidates for indirect revascularization surgery.",['Li JJ; Ren B; Wang XP; Wang QN; Bao XY; Guo QB; Kong ZQ; Liu JQ; Gao G; Wang MJ; Liu SM; Fu HG; Tong HY; Duan L'],2024,authors aimed to develop a nomogram to predict good neoangiogenesis in patients with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) 126 patients (213 hemispheres) with MMD and T2DM who underwent EDAS between June 2004 and December 2018 were included in the analysis.
Structure and mechanism of the human CTDNEP1-NEP1R1 membrane protein phosphatase complex necessary to maintain ER membrane morphology.,"C-terminal Domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) is a noncanonical protein serine/threonine phosphatase that has a conserved role in regulating ER membrane biogenesis. Inactivating mutations in CTDNEP1 correlate with the development of medulloblastoma, an aggressive childhood cancer. The transmembrane protein Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 1 (NEP1R1) binds CTDNEP1, but the molecular details by which NEP1R1 regulates CTDNEP1 function are unclear. Here, we find that knockdown of NEP1R1 generates identical phenotypes to reported loss of CTDNEP1 in mammalian cells, establishing CTDNEP1-NEP1R1 as an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein phosphatase complex that restricts ER expansion. Mechanistically, NEP1R1 acts as an activating regulatory subunit that directly binds and increases the phosphatase activity of CTDNEP1. By defining a minimal NEP1R1 domain sufficient to activate CTDNEP1, we determine high-resolution crystal structures of the CTDNEP1-NEP1R1 complex bound to a peptide sequence acting as a pseudosubstrate. Structurally, NEP1R1 engages CTDNEP1 at a site distant from the active site to stabilize and allosterically activate CTDNEP1. Substrate recognition is facilitated by a conserved Arg residue in CTDNEP1 that binds and orients the substrate peptide in the active site. Together, this reveals mechanisms for how NEP1R1 regulates CTDNEP1 and explains how cancer-associated mutations inactivate CTDNEP1.",['Gao S; Carrasquillo Rodríguez JW; Bahmanyar S; Airola MV'],2024,nuclear envelope Phosphatase 1 regulated subunit 1 (NEP1R1) binds CTDNEP1. knockdown of NEP1R1 generates identical phenotypes to reported loss of CTDNEP1 in mammalian cells.
Cost of Healthcare Services in Geriatric Neuro-oncology: A descriptive Analysis.,"The percentage of brain tumor incidence exceeds 50% in the geriatric population admitted at Khoula Hospital (a tertiary care hospital in Oman) as compared to the younger population, furthermore, geriatric patients impose a higher cost of healthcare in general. Therefore, geriatric tumor care is causing a significant burden on the healthcare service in Oman. For this reason, we have developed this study to identify the cost of care for this group. Medical data with their costs were collected retrospectively for 108 patients diagnosed with a brain tumor above the age of 65 years and admitted at Khoula Hospital between 2016 and 2019. The two most common diagnoses in terms of incidence were Meningiomas (31.73%) and Glioblastomas (16.34%). Lymphoma peaked with regards to the cost, with an average cost of 8993.83 USD per diagnosis, followed by glioblastoma and then metastatic lesions (with 5039.18 and 4915.76 USD respectively). Of these surgeries, 82.61% were elective, most of which had a cost above or equal to the average. Emergency surgeries showed equal numbers above and below the average cost of surgeries (P< 0.05). The total costs of imaging were 73759.4 USD, with CT (35.8%) + MRI (32.9%) forming 68.7% of the total imaging costs. While laboratory investigation costs totaled 64110.93 USD. The cost of tumor care in Oman is variable based on multiple factors. The reported results represent useful information forming the basis for further analysis such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, and cost-utility analysis.",['Al-Siyabi ZS; Al-Mahrouqi O; Al-Senani O; Al-Amri S; Al-Ajmi Z; Al-Nazwani A; Taheri F; Al-Hashimi H; Al-Sheriyani M; Al-Ani MT; Al-Shamli SA; Al-Abri S; Al-Saadi T'],2024,geriatric patients impose higher cost of healthcare in general. geriatric patients impose higher cost of care in general. geriatric patients impose higher cost of healthcare in general.
Metabolic dysregulation in obese women and the carcinogenesis of gynecological tumors: A review.,"Obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks, including gynecological malignancies. The worldwide rise in obesity rates is significantly impacting both cancer development and treatment outcomes. Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in metabolism, secreting various substances that can influence cancer formation. In obese individuals, dysfunctional adipose tissue can contribute to cancer development through inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Studies have shown a strong correlation between obesity and gynecological cancers, particularly endometrial and breast cancers. Obesity not only increases the risk of developing these cancers but is also associated with poorer outcomes. Additionally, obesity affects the perioperative management of gynecological cancers, requiring specialized care due to increased complications and resistance to therapy. Treatment strategies for managing metabolic dysregulation in patients with gynecological cancers include weight management, statin therapy, and insulin-sensitizing medications. Emerging studies suggest that interventions like intermittent fasting and caloric restriction may enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments. Furthermore, targeting cholesterol metabolism, such as with statins or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, shows potential in cancer therapy. In conclusion, addressing metabolic issues, particularly obesity, is crucial in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies. Personalized approaches focusing on weight management and metabolic reprogramming may improve outcomes in these patients.",['Tomić Naglić D; Mandić A; Milankov A; Pejaković S; Janičić S; Vuković N; Bajkin I; Ičin T; Manojlović M; Stokić E'],2024,obesity is a significant health issue associated with increased cancer risks. obesity is a key health issue associated with increased cancer risks. obesity is a key factor in preventing and treating gynecological malignancies.
Urinary miRNAs: Technical Updates.,"Due to its non-invasive nature and easy accessibility, urine serves as a convenient bi-ological fluid for research purposes. Furthermore, urine samples are uncomplicated to preserve and relatively inexpensive. MicroRNA (miRNAs), small molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, play vital roles in numerous cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell differentiation, development, and proliferation. Their dysregulated expression in urine has been proposed as a potential bi-omarker for various human diseases, including bladder cancer. To draw reliable conclusions about the roles of urinary miRNAs in human diseases, it is essential to have dependable and reproducible methods for miRNA extraction and profiling. In this review, we address the technical challenges associated with studying urinary miRNAs and provide an update on the current technologies used for urinary miRNA isolation, quality control assessment, and miRNA profiling, highlighting both their advantages and limitations.",['Raveendran S; Al Massih A; Al Hashmi M; Saeed A; Al-Azwani I; Mathew R; Tomei S'],2024,urine samples are uncomplicated to preserve and relatively inexpensive. microRNAs play vital roles in numerous cellular processes. they regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
A review of lactate-lactylation in malignancy: its potential in immunotherapy.,"Lactic acid was formerly regarded as a byproduct of metabolism. However, extensive investigations into the intricacies of cancer development have revealed its significant contributions to tumor growth, migration, and invasion. Post-translational modifications involving lactate have been widely observed in histone and non-histone proteins, and these modifications play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by covalently attaching lactoyl groups to lysine residues in proteins. This discovery has greatly enhanced our comprehension of lactic acid's involvement in disease pathogenesis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the intricate relationship between lactate and tumor immunity, the occurrence of lactylation in malignant tumors, and the exploitation of targeted lactate-lactylation in tumor immunotherapy. Additionally, we discuss future research directions, aiming to offer novel insights that could inform the investigation, diagnosis, and treatment of related diseases.",['Zha J; Zhang J; Lu J; Zhang G; Hua M; Guo W; Yang J; Fan G'],2024,"extensive investigations into the intricacies of cancer development have revealed its significant contributions to tumor growth, migration, and invasion. post-translational modifications involving lactate have been widely observed in histone and non-histone proteins. this discovery has greatly enhanced our comprehension of lactic acid's involvement in disease pathogenesis."
Estrogen restores disordered lipid metabolism in visceral fat of prediabetic mice.,"Visceral obesity is increasingly prevalent among adolescents and young adults and is commonly recognized as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Estrogen [17β-estradiol (E2)] is known to offer protection against obesity <i>via</i> diverse me-chanisms, while its specific effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) remain to be fully elucidated. To investigate the impact of E2 on the gene expression profile within VAT of a mouse model of prediabetes. Metabolic parameters were collected, encompassing body weight, weights of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues (VAT and SAT), random blood glucose levels, glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, and overall body composition. The gene expression profiles of VAT were quantified utilizing the Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarray and subsequently analyzed through Agilent Feature Extraction software. Functional and pathway analyses were conducted employing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses, respectively. Feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) moderately increased the weights of both VAT and SAT, but this increase was mitigated by the protective effect of endogenous E2. Conversely, ovariectomy (OVX) led to a significant increase in VAT weight and the VAT/SAT weight ratio, and this increase was also reversed with E2 treatment. Notably, OVX diminished the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism compared to HFD feeding alone, signaling a widespread reduction in lipid metabolic activity, which was completely counteracted by E2 administration. This study provides a comprehensive insight into E2's local and direct protective effects against visceral adiposity in VAT at the gene level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the HFD-induced over-nutritional challenge disrupted the gene expression profile of visceral fat, leading to a universally decreased lipid metabolic status in E2 deficient mice. E2 treatment effectively reversed this condition, shedding light on the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of E2 in combating visceral obesity.",['Liu SH; Shangguan ZS; Maitiaximu P; Li ZP; Chen XX; Li CD'],2024,a mouse model of prediabetes was able to analyse the effects of E2 on the gene expression profile within VAT. ovariectomy (OVX) led to a significant increase in VAT weight and the VAT/SAT weight ratio.

[Impact and intervention of postoperative complications after gastric cancer surgery from a health economics perspective].,"Gastric cancer ranks as the third most prevalent malignant tumor in our nation, imposing a substantial health and economic burden. The occurrence of postoperative complications in gastric cancer not only hinders patient recovery but also significantly increases the medical expenditures of patients, contributing supplementary health economic challenges to both society and healthcare institutions. Conducting health economic analysis on postoperative complications in gastric cancer provides evidence for the formulation of health policies, offers guidance for hospital cost control, and furnishes economic insights for the development of new technologies in the prevention and treatment of complications. This paper, through a thorough review of domestic and international literature, comprehensively examines the impact of complication severity on healthcare expenses, delineates the principal contributors to healthcare costs in patients with postoperative complications, and proposes practical strategies to alleviate the health economic burden resulting from such complications.

[Sexual health and oncology].,"Over the past 20 years, the number of new cancer diagnoses has risen steadily, partly due to the aging of the population. In 2021, 74,998 new diagnoses were recorded in Belgium. At the same time, improved screening techniques and advances in oncology treatments have increased patient survival. As a result, the prevalence of cancer has risen: 4 out of every 100 Belgians are currently living with cancer. In addition to the symptoms caused by the disease, patients have to cope with the side effects of treatments. Quality of life is becoming essential in the care of these patients, and this requires better communication, quality information, and the implementation of appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures. Sexual health is an integral part of overall health, well-being, and quality of life. It must therefore be assessed and integrated into patient care throughout the entire course of treatment.",['Grandjean L; Rahier J; Coucke P'],2024,4 out of every 100 Belgians are currently living with cancer. the prevalence of cancer has risen in the past 20 years.
Transgender health objectives of training for adult Endocrinology and Metabolism programs: Outcomes of a modified-Delphi study.,"Transgender people encounter significant barriers when seeking timely, high-quality healthcare, resulting in unmet medical needs with increased rates of diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and HIV. The paucity of postgraduate medical education to invest in standardization of transgender health training sustains these barriers, leaving physicians feeling unprepared and averse to provide transgender health care. Closing this education gap and improving transgender healthcare necessitates the development of consensus-built transgender health objectives of training (THOOT), particularly in Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. We conducted a two-round modified-Delphi process involving a nationally representative panel of experts, including Adult Endocrinology and Metabolism program directors, physician content experts, residents, and transgender community members, to identify THOOT for inclusion in Canadian Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs. Participants used a 5-point Likert scale to assess THOOT importance for curricular inclusion, with opportunities for written feedback. Data was collected through Qualtrics and analyzed after each round. In the first Delphi round, panelists reviewed and rated 81 literature extracted THOOT, achieving consensus on all objectives. Following panelists' feedback, 5 THOOT were added, 9 removed, 34 consolidated into 12 objectives, and 47 were rephrased or retained. In the second Delphi round, panelists assessed 55 THOOT. Consensus was established for 8 THOOT. Program directors' post-Delphi feedback further consolidated objectives to arrive at 4 THOOT for curriculum inclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first time a consensus-based approach has been used to establish THOOT for any subspecialty postgraduate medicine program across Canada or the United States. Our results lay the foundation towards health equity and social justice in transgender health medical education, offering a blueprint for future innovations.",['Ahmad T; Schreyer L; Fung R; Yu C'],2024,"transgender people encounter significant barriers when seeking timely, high-quality healthcare. the paucity of postgraduate medical education to invest in standardization of transgender health training sustains these barriers. a panel of experts analyzed THOOT for inclusion in Canadian Endocrinology and Metabolism Residency programs."
A bi-directional segmentation method for prostate ultrasound images under semantic constraints.,"Due to the lack of sufficient labeled data for the prostate and the extensive and complex semantic information in ultrasound images, accurately and quickly segmenting the prostate in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images remains a challenging task. In this context, this paper proposes a solution for TRUS image segmentation using an end-to-end bidirectional semantic constraint method, namely the BiSeC model. The experimental results show that compared with classic or popular deep learning methods, this method has better segmentation performance, with the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 96.74% and the Intersection over Union (IoU) of 93.71%. Our model achieves a good balance between actual boundaries and noise areas, reducing costs while ensuring the accuracy and speed of segmentation.",['Li Z; Du W; Shi Y; Li W; Gao C'],2024,"the bidirectional semantic constraint method is a solution for TRUS image segmentation. the results show that compared with traditional deep learning methods, this method has better segmentation performance."
The causal relationship between gut microbiota and lymphoma: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous studies have indicated a potential link between the gut microbiota and lymphoma. However, the exact causal interplay between the two remains an area of ambiguity. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to elucidate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and five types of lymphoma. The research drew upon microbiome data from a research project of 14,306 participants and lymphoma data encompassing 324,650 cases. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were meticulously chosen as instrumental variables according to multiple stringent criteria. Five MR methodologies, including the inverse variance weighted approach, were utilized to assess the direct causal impact between the microbial exposures and lymphoma outcomes. Moreover, sensitivity analyses were carried out to robustly scrutinize and validate the potential presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy, thereby ensuring the reliability and accuracy. We discerned 38 potential causal associations linking genetic predispositions within the gut microbiome to the development of lymphoma. A few of the more significant results are as follows: Genus <i>Coprobacter</i> (OR = 0.619, 95% CI 0.438-0.873, <i>P</i> = 0.006) demonstrated a potentially protective effect against Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Genus <i>Alistipes</i> (OR = 0.473, 95% CI 0.278-0.807, <i>P </i>= 0.006) was a protective factor for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Genus <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (OR = 0.541, 95% CI 0.341-0.857, <i>P </i>= 0.009) exhibited suggestive protective effects against follicular lymphoma. Genus <i>LachnospiraceaeUCG001</i> (OR = 0.354, 95% CI 0.198-0.631, <i>P </i>= 0.0004) showed protective properties against T/NK cell lymphoma. The <i>Q</i> test indicated an absence of heterogeneity, and the MR-Egger test did not show significant horizontal polytropy. Furthermore, the leave-one-out analysis failed to identify any SNP that exerted a substantial influence on the overall results. Our study elucidates a definitive causal link between gut microbiota and lymphoma development, pinpointing specific microbial taxa with potential causative roles in lymphomagenesis, as well as identifying probiotic candidates that may impact disease progression, which provide new ideas for possible therapeutic approaches to lymphoma and clues to the pathogenesis of lymphoma.",['Li B; Han Y; Fu Z; Chai Y; Guo X; Du S; Li C; Wang D'],2024,"a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to elucidate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and five types of lymphoma. the results were based on microbiome data from a research project of 14,306 participants and lymphoma data."
"A comprehensive review on traditional uses, phytochemical, and pharmacological properties of the genus Antidesma L.","The genus Antidesma L. (Phyllanthaceae) consists of 102 species and is distributed throughout the subtropical, temperate, and subpolar regions. Numerous species in this genus are employed in ethnomedical practices to treat a range of ailments including anaemia, diabetes, herpes, skin infections, typhoid, throat and lung diseases, gastrointestinal, jaundice, rheumatic, and many more diseases. This review aimed to highlight the ethnopharmacological uses, phytochemical components, biological activities, and future research opportunities of the genus. A total number of 112 research papers published between the period 1977 and 2023 were considered and reviewed were retrieved from scientific databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, Elsevier Scient Direct, Google Scholar, and PubMed. The literature study revealed that both plant extracts and phytochemicals exhibited a wide range of biological activities including antidiabetes, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammation, and many other activities. Overall, a total number of 236 compounds have been encountered from the different species of Antidesma. These compounds belong to different chemical groups such as alkaloids, flavonoids, fatty acids, lignans, sterols, terpenoids, coumarins, and others. Three compounds such as antidesmone, amentoflavone, and β-sitosterol were found to be possible chemotaxonomic markers for the genus Antisema.

Food Insecurity and Hypoglycemia among Older Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Treated with Insulin or Sulfonylureas: The Diabetes & Aging Study.,"Severe hypoglycemia is a serious adverse drug event associated with hypoglycemia-prone medications; older patients with diabetes are particularly at high risk. Economic food insecurity (food insecurity due to financial limitations) is a known risk factor for hypoglycemia; however, less is known about physical food insecurity (due to difficulty cooking or shopping for food), which may increase with age, and its association with hypoglycemia. Study associations between food insecurity and severe hypoglycemia. Survey based cross-sectional study. Survey responses were collected in 2019 from 1,164 older (≥ 65 years) patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin or sulfonylureas. Risk ratios (RR) for economic and physical food insecurity associated with self-reported severe hypoglycemia (low blood glucose requiring assistance) adjusted for age, financial strain, HbA1c, Charlson comorbidity score and frailty. Self-reported reasons for hypoglycemia endorsed by respondents. Food insecurity was reported by 12.3% of the respondents; of whom 38.4% reported economic food insecurity only, 21.1% physical food insecurity only and 40.5% both. Economic food insecurity and physical food insecurity were strongly associated with severe hypoglycemia (RR = 4.3; p = 0.02 and RR = 4.4; p = 0.002, respectively). Missed meals (""skipped meals, not eating enough or waiting too long to eat"") was the dominant reason (77.5%) given for hypoglycemia.

Association of prediabetes with clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome: a post hoc analysis of the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials.,"There is conflicting evidence whether prediabetes is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. We aimed to assess the effect of prediabetes in patients with chronic coronary syndrome on clinical outcomes. This is a secondary analysis of data from the ISCHEMIA and ISCHEMIA-CKD trials, including patients with chronic coronary syndrome determined by coronary computed tomography angiography or exercise-stress testing. Participants were assigned to the normoglycemia group (HbA1c < 5.7% [< 39 mmol/mol]), prediabetes group (HbA1c 5.7-6.4% [40-47 mmol/mol]), or diabetes group (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% [≥ 48 mmol/mol]). The primary end point of this study was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiovascular events and composites thereof. Overall, the primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 330 (8.4%) of 3910 patients over a median follow-up time of 3.1 years (IQR 2.1-4.1). The primary endpoint all-cause mortality occurred in 37 (5.2%) of 716 patients in the normoglycemia group, in 63 (6.9%) of 911 in the prediabetes group, and in 230 (10.1%) of 2283 in the diabetes group. In the covariate-adjusted Cox model analysis, the estimated adjusted HR (aHR) in the prediabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.45 (95%CI, 0.95-2.20). The aHR in the diabetes group as compared with the normoglycemia group was 1.84 (95%CI, 1.29-2.65). Prediabetes, compared with normoglycemia, was associated with an increased risk of stroke (aHR, 3.44, 95%CI, 1.15-10.25). Subgroup analyses suggested an increased risk of all-cause death associated with prediabetes in males and patients under 65 years.

Body surface area is positively associated with ankle-brachial index.,"Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement is a widely used diagnostic test for lower extremity artery disease. Previously, a larger body surface area (BSA) has been associated with lower blood pressure and lower 2-h post-load glucose concentrations in the oral glucose tolerance test. Our aim was to evaluate whether BSA has an impact on ABI and the prevalence of lower ABI values. ABI measurements were performed on 972 subjects aged 45 to 70 years at high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Subjects with previously diagnosed kidney disease, CVD, and diabetes were excluded. Their BSA was calculated by the Mosteller formula. Study subjects were divided into ﬁve BSA levels corresponding to 12.5<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, and 12.5<sup>th</sup> percentiles of the total distribution. Effect modification by BSA in ABI between sexes was derived from a four-knot restricted cubic splines regression model. After adjustments for age, sex, pulse pressure, glucose regulation, waist circumference, alcohol intake, smoking status, leisure-time physical activity and medication, BSA level had a positive linear relationship with ABI (<i>p</i> for linearity <0.001). When BSA was less than 2.0 m<sup>2</sup>, there was no difference between the sexes, but when BSA was higher than 2.0 m<sup>2</sup>, men had higher ABI. BSA shows a positive linear relationship with ABI in CVD risk subjects without manifested CVD.

Associations between dietary diversity and high sensitive C-reactive protein among Japanese workers: findings of a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.,"To clarify the association between dietary diversity and inflammatory status in Japanese workers. Of 1,460 men and women aged 20-64 years in 2010 (baseline), those who were followed-up at least once between 2011 and 2018 were included in this study; 1,433 participants and 745 participants were included in the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, respectively. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire at baseline, and the dietary diversity score was determined using the Quantitative Index for Dietary Diversity (QUANTIDD). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was taken to indicate inflammatory status at the baseline and follow-up surveys. In the cross-sectional analysis using baseline data, a generalized linear model was used to calculate adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hs-CRP according to the QUANTIDD score. In the longitudinal analysis, generalized estimating equations were used to calculate the adjusted mean (95% CI) for hs-CRP in follow-up according to the QUANTIDD score at baseline. In the cross-sectional analysis, the hs-CRP concentration in male participants was significantly lower in those who had a high QUANTIDD score (adjusted mean [95% CI]: 0.074 [0.009-0.140] mg/dL in the lower group vs. 0.038 [-0.029-0.105] mg/dL in the higher group, p-value = 0.034). In the longitudinal analysis, the hs-CRP concentration of male participants also tended to be lower in those with higher QUANTIDD scores (p-value = 0.103). In both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in women, there was no significant difference between the lower and higher QUANTIDD score groups. These findings suggest that, in male Japanese workers, higher dietary diversity might be important for maintaining a low inflammatory status.",['Nakamoto M; Torami K; Bui TT; Tojyo A; Yamada K; Nakamoto A; Hata A; Aki N; Shikama Y; Bando Y; Ichihara T; Minagawa T; Tamura A; Kuwamura Y; Funaki M; Sakai T'],2024,dietary diversity was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was taken to indicate inflammatory status.
Shorter long-term post-transplant life expectancy may be due to prior chemotherapy for the underlying disease: analysis of 3012 patients with acute myeloid leukemia enrolled on 9 consecutive ECOG-ACRIN trials.,"Several studies reported that patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who remain in long-term remission after allogeneic or autologous transplant have a shorter life expectancy, compared to the general population. However, little is known about the life expectancy of adult long-term survivors of AML who were treated with chemotherapy alone without a transplant and there have been no comparisons with survival among the general population. The current study indicates that the life expectancy of AML patients who achieved and maintained CR for at least 3 years is shorter than expected for age in the US population. This was observed also in patients who did not undergo a transplant including those who have not relapsed during the entire long follow-up period. Thus, late relapse does not explain why patients without transplants have a shortened life expectancy.

Hydroxycitrate delays early mortality in mice and promotes muscle regeneration while inducing a rich hepatic energetic status.,"ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitors have the potential of modulating central processes in protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, which can have relevant physiological consequences in aging and age-related diseases. Here, we show that hepatic phospho-active ACLY correlates with overweight and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score in humans. Wild-type mice treated chronically with the ACLY inhibitor potassium hydroxycitrate exhibited delayed early mortality. In AML12 hepatocyte cultures, the ACLY inhibitors potassium hydroxycitrate, SB-204990, and bempedoic acid fostered lipid accumulation, which was also observed in the liver of healthy-fed mice treated with potassium hydroxycitrate. Analysis of soleus tissue indicated that potassium hydroxycitrate produced the modulation of wound healing processes. In vivo, potassium hydroxycitrate modulated locomotor function toward increased wire hang performance and reduced rotarod performance in healthy-fed mice, and improved locomotion in mice exposed to cardiotoxin-induced muscle atrophy. Our findings implicate ACLY and ACLY inhibitors in different aspects of aging and muscle regeneration.",['Espadas I; Cáliz-Molina MÁ; López-Fernández-Sobrino R; Panadero-Morón C; Sola-García A; Soriano-Navarro M; Martínez-Force E; Venegas-Calerón M; Salas JJ; Martín F; Gauthier BR; Alfaro-Cervelló C; Martí-Aguado D; Capilla-González V; Martín-Montalvo A'],2024,"ATP citrate lyase inhibitors have the potential of modulating central processes in protein, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. hepatic phospho-active ACLY correlates with overweight and model for end-stage liver disease score in humans."
Effects of Metreleptin in Patients with Generalized Lipodystrophy Before vs After the Onset of Severe Metabolic Disease.,"Leptin replacement therapy with metreleptin improves metabolic abnormalities in patients with generalized lipodystrophy (GLD). Determine how timing of metreleptin initiation in the clinical course of GLD affects long-term metabolic health. Retrospective analysis of patients ≥ 6 months old with congenital (n=47) or acquired (n=16) GLD treated with metreleptin at the National Institutes of Health since 2001. Least squares means (LSM) for HbA1c, insulin area under the curve (AUC) from oral glucose tolerance tests, triglycerides, urine protein excretion, platelets, transaminases, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) for early and late treatment groups, defined by baseline metabolic health, were analyzed during median 72 (24, 108) months follow-up. Compared to late groups, early groups based on metabolic status had higher mean±SEM insulin AUC (20831±1 vs 11948±1), lower HbA1c (5.3±0.3 vs 6.8±0.3%), triglycerides (101±1 vs 193±1 mg/dL), urine protein excretion (85±1.5 vs 404±1.4 mg/24 hr), ALT (30±1 vs 53±1 U/L), AST (23±1 vs 40±1 U/L), and APRI (0.22±1.3 vs 0.78±1.3), and higher platelets (257±24 vs 152±28 K/µL) during follow-up (P<0.05). Compared to patients ≥6 years old at baseline, patients <6 years had lower HbA1c (4.5±0.5 vs 6.4±0.2%) and higher AST (40±1vs 23±1 U/L) during follow (P<0.05). Patients with GLD who initiated metreleptin before the onset of severe metabolic complications had better long-term control of diabetes, proteinuria, and hypertriglyceridemia.

"Major Pancreatic Resection Increases Bone Mineral Density Loss, Osteoporosis, and Fractures.","To assess whether long-term survivors of pancreatic surgery show increased risk to develop impaired bone mineral density, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency. Pancreatic resection poses a risk for malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other micronutrients essential for bone mineralization. Here, we evaluated the long-term effects of pancreatic resection on bone mineral density (BMD) and its clinical sequelae. This was a two-pronged analysis of post-pancreatectomy patients with a follow-up period greater than 3 years comprising (1) a large, propensity score-matched, cohort study based on a multinational federated research network (FRN) and (2) a retrospective single institution review of clinical and radiographic patient data. In the FRN analysis, an initial cohort of 8,423 post-pancreatectomy patients were identified and propensity score-matched with normal controls. The primary endpoint was the 10-year risk of developing osteoporotic pathological fractures and secondary endpoints included diagnosis of osteoporosis, vitamin-D deficiency, and related therapies. The single institution retrospective analysis identified 224 patients who underwent pancreatic resection between 2005 and 2019. BMD was quantified in CT images acquired before and after surgery. BMD trends and related factors were assessed in a time-series mixed effect linear regression model. A total of 8,080 propensity score-matched pairs were included in the FRN analysis. The analysis revealed a 2.4-fold increase in pathological fractures (P<0.0001) and 1.4-1.5 fold increase in osteoporosis/osteomalacia (P<0.0001) and vitamin-D deficiency (P<0.0001) in post-pancreatectomy patients. Vitamin-D supplements were more common in the pancreatectomy group (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.28-1.53, P<0.0001), as were specific osteoporosis/osteomalacia treatments such as calcitonin, denosumab, romosozumab, abaloparatide, and teriparatide (OR 2.24, 95%CI 1.69-2.95, P<0.0001). Retrospective analysis of CT imaging revealed that BMD declined more rapidly following pancreatic resection compared to normal historical controls (P=0.015). Older age, pancreatic cancer, and pancreaticoduodenectomy were associated with increased rates of BMD loss (P<0.05, each). After pancreatic resection, patients are at higher risk for BMD loss and subsequent fractures. As the cohort of pancreatic resection survivorship grows, attention will need to be paid to focused prevention efforts to reduce BMD loss, osteoporosis, and fractures in these vulnerable patients, with specific attention to the pancreatic cancer population.",['Khalilieh S; Iyer A; Hammelef E; Zohar N; Gorgov E; Yeo TP; Lavu H; Bowne W; Yeo CJ; Nevler A'],2024,pancreatic resection poses a risk for malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. this was a two-pronged analysis of post-pancreatectomy patients. the primary endpoint was the 10-year risk of developing osteoporotic pathological fractures.
Outcomes and Recurrence Rate of Esophageal Varices after Endoscopic Treatment in Patients with Alcoholic Cirrhosis and Viral Cirrhosis.,"The incidence of alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is increasing. However, few reports have focused on ALC-derived esophageal varices (EV). We retrospectively examined differences in overall survival (OS) and EV recurrence rate in patients after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) for ALC and hepatic B/C virus liver cirrhosis (B/C-LC). We analyzed data from 215 patients (B/C-LC, 147; ALC, 68) who underwent EIS. The primary endpoints were OS and EV recurrence in patients with unsuccessful abstinence ALC and those with uncontrolled B/C-LC, before and after propensity score matching (PSM) to unify the patients' background. The secondary endpoints were predictors associated with these factors, as determined by multivariate analysis. The observation period was 1,430 ± 1,363 days. In the analysis of all patients, OS was significantly higher in the ALC group than in the B/C-LC group (p = 0.039); however, there was no difference in EV recurrence rate (p = 0.502). Ascites and history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (p = 0.019 and p < 0.001, respectively) predicted OS, whereas age and EV size predicted recurrence (p = 0.011 and 0.024, respectively). In total, 96 patients without an HCC history were matched by PSM, and there was no significant difference in OS or EV recurrence rate (p = 0.508 and 0.246, respectively). When limited to patients without a history of HCC, OS and the EV recurrence rate were comparable in patients with ALC who continued to consume alcohol and those with B/C-LC without viral control.",['Furuichi Y; Nishiguchi R; Shimakawa T; Fujiwara T; Sato K; Kato H'],2024,esophageal varices (EV) are the most common causes of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. the esophageal varices (EV) are the most common causes of alcoholic liver cirrhosis.
Local intralesional talimogene laherparepvec therapy with complete local response in oral palatine mucosal melanoma: a case report.,"Mucosal melanoma, an aggressive type of malignancy different from the cutaneous melanomas commonly seen in the head and neck region, represents < 1% of all malignant melanomas. The pathogenesis of mucosal melanoma is unknown. Targetable mutations commonly seen in cutaneous melanoma, such as in the BRAF and NRAS genes, have a lower incidence in mucosal melanoma. Mucosal melanoma carries a distinct mutational pattern from cutaneous melanoma. Surgery with negative margins is the first-line treatment for mucosal melanoma, and systemic therapy is not well defined. Talimogene laherparepvec, an oncolytic viral immunotherapy, is United States Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of advanced malignant cutaneous melanoma, with local therapeutic benefits. Mucosal melanoma was initially excluded from talimogene laherparepvec's initial phase III clinical trial. We present the case of a white female patient in her 40s with past medical history of systemic lupus erythematous, scleroderma, and estrogen-receptor-positive invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Following a bilateral mastectomy, the patient was found to have BRAF-negative mucosal melanoma of her hard palate with a soft palate skip lesion. Owing to the presence of a skip mucosal lesion as well as the anticipated defect and need for free-flap reconstructive surgery, nonsurgical management was considered. The patient was referred to medical oncology, where-based on the patient's complicated medical history and the risk of immunotherapy possibly worsening her prior autoimmune diseases-local talimogene laherparepvec injections were chosen as the primary therapy for her mucosal lesions. Though talimogene laherparepvec is approved for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma, there are limited data available on the use of talimogene laherparepvec in mucosal melanomas. The patient had a complete local tumor response at both the primary lesion as well as the skip lesion with the local injections.

Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Thyroid Has a Molecular Genetic Profile Distinct From That of Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma: A Whole Exome Sequencing and Gene Expression Profiling Study.,"Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thyroid and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) show significant clinical and histologic overlap. Their biological behaviors are so similar that the fifth WHO updates SCC as a morphologic pattern of ATC rather than a separate entity. However, molecular genomic evidence that determines them as the same histologic type is limited. We aimed to explore whether they belong to the same classification from a molecular-typing perspective. A cohort enrolled 15 SCCs and 15 ATCs was collected. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-sequencing were performed to analyze molecular genetic and gene-expression profiles. Significantly differential-mutant genes were BRAF, DPCR1, PCYOX1L, BRSK2, NRG1, PRR14L, TET1, VAMP4 suggesting differences in mutation level, as well as differences in high-frequency mutated genes, and SCC had a much lower tumor mutation burden than ATC. Mutational co-occurrence and mutual exclusion were less frequent in SCC than in ATC. 2047 differential-express genes were screened, indicating differences in gene expression were extremely strong. In principal component analysis, ATC and SCC could be notably clustered together, respectively, meanwhile they could be explicitly distinguished. Unsupervised clustering analysis validated they can indeed be clearly separated from each other which demonstrated that they may be two distinctive entities. It is controversial yet SCC is classified as a morphologic pattern of ATC. We revealed that SCC exhibited molecular genetic characteristics distinct from ATC. Although the fifth WHO categorizes them together, this study may provide strong molecular genetic evidence for the next edition of WHO classification that may allow for the separation of thyroid SCC from ATC.",['Ye M; Guo Z; Xu J; Jin Y; He X; Ge M'],2024,primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thyroid and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) show significant clinical and histologic overlap. the fifth WHO updates SCC as a morphologic pattern of ATC rather than a separate entity.
Career adaptability among new oncology nurses: A longitudinal exploration.,"This study aims to explore the longitudinal predictive effect of self-awareness on career adaptability in new nurses at a tumor specialty hospital and the mediating mechanisms of work readiness and transition shock. Career adaptability is crucial for the personal development of nurses and also intricately linked to the retention rates among newcomers in oncology nursing. Inadequate career adaptability contributes to higher turnover, which in turn exacerbates the shortage of qualified nursing personnel in this field. There is a pressing need for dedicated research and interventions that support new nurses, especially in specialized areas like oncology, to promote their well-being and career advancement. Comprehending these challenges is essential for devising effective strategies that will retain nursing talent and ensure the sustainability of a robust healthcare workforce. Longitudinal data from four follow-up surveys were collected from 248 new clinical nurses at the National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, and Peking Union Medical College. Mediation analyses using R 4.1.2 were conducted to examine the pathways between self-awareness, work readiness, transition shock, and career adaptability. Self-awareness not only directly predicts career adaptability but also influences it through the bidirectional and chained mediating pathways of work readiness and transition shock. These findings equip nursing managers with flexible strategies to foster and enhance nurses' career adaptability, providing targeted support as nurses assimilate into their clinical roles. This not only strengthens workforce stability but also mitigates turnover, ultimately reinforcing the healthcare workforce.",['Liu M; Liu L; Lv Z; Mao Y; Liu Y'],2024,"study aims to explore longitudinal predictive effect of self-awareness on career adaptability in new nurses at a tumor specialty hospital. inadequate career adaptability contributes to higher turnover, which in turn exacerbates the shortage of qualified nursing personnel in this field."
A retrospective study of an irradiation-based conditioning regimen and chidamide maintenance therapy in T-ALL/LBL.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) are highly malignant and aggressive hematologic tumors for which there is no standard first-line treatment. Chidamide, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, shows great promise. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an irradiation-containing conditioning regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and post-transplantation chidamide maintenance in patients with T-ALL/LBL. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of six patients with T-ALL/LBL who underwent allo-HSCT with a radiotherapy-containing pretreatment regimen and post-transplant chidamide maintenance therapy. The endpoints were relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant-related mortality (TRM), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). All of the patients had uneventful post-transplant hematopoietic reconstitution, and all achieved complete molecular remission within 30 days. All six patients survived, and two relapsed with a median relapse time of 828.5 (170-1335) days. The 1-year OS rate was 100%, the 2-year PFS rate was 66.7%, and the TRM rate was 0%. After transplantation, two patients developed grade I-II acute GVHD (2/6); grade III-IV acute and chronic GVHD were not observed. The most common AEs following chidamide administration were hematological AEs, which occurred to varying degrees in all patients; liver function abnormalities occurred in two patients (grade 2), and symptoms of malaise occurred in one patient (grade 1). Chidamide maintenance therapy after T-ALL/LBL transplantation is safe, but the efficacy needs to be further investigated.",['Wang X; Deng Y; He G; Lai S; Li Y; Zhang S; He Y; Han Y; Zhang L; Su Y; Liu F; Yi H'],2024,"chidamide is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor. the tumors are highly malignant and aggressive hematologic tumors. the endpoints were relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant-related mortality (TRM), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs)"
Cardioprotective effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in heart failure: Myth or truth?,"Therapy with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists has raised great interest for its beneficial cardiovascular effects in preventing atherosclerosis and heart failure-related outcomes. However, while evidence about atherosclerosis consistently suggests a cardioprotective potential with class effect, controversies remain on its impact on heart failure. GLP1 receptor agonists appear to prevent hospitalization for new-onset heart failure and reduce symptoms in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (as demonstrated by the recent STEP-HFpEF Trial). Still, GLP1 agonism has resulted in neutral or even harmful effects in patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (the LIVE trial). GLP1 receptor agonists benefit the cardiovascular system indirectly through their marked metabolic effects (improved weight management, glycemic control, blood pressure, systemic and tissue inflammation), while direct effects on the heart have been questioned. Nonetheless, weight loss alone achieved through GLP1 receptor agonists has failed in improving left ventricular functions. Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of GLP1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, representing an innovative treatment option in diabetes with a major impact on weight loss and promising cardiovascular benefits. Whether this class of therapies is going to change the history of heart failure is an ongoing debate.",['Nesti L; Trico D'],2024,controversies remain on its impact on heart failure. glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists appear to prevent hospitalization for new-onset heart failure. but controversies remain on its impact on heart failure.
Circulating tumour cells predict recurrences and survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.,"Patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are at a high risk of developing recurrence and secondary cancers. This study evaluates the prognostic and surveillance utilities of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) in HNSCC. A total of 154 HNSCC patients were recruited and followed up for 4.5 years. Blood samples were collected at baseline and follow-up. CTCs were isolated using a spiral microfluid device. Recurrence and death due to cancer were assessed during the follow-up period. In patients with HNSCC, the presence of CTCs at baseline was a predictor of recurrence (OR = 8.40, p < 0.0001) and death (OR= ∞, p < 0.0001). Patients with CTCs at baseline had poor survival outcomes (p < 0.0001). Additionally, our study found that patients with CTCs in a follow-up appointment were 2.5 times more likely to experience recurrence or death from HNSCC (p < 0.05) prior to their next clinical visit. Our study highlights the prognostic and monitoring utilities of CTCs' in HNSCC patients.

Impact of hepatic artery variation on surgical and oncological outcomes in robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"In patients with hepatic artery variation (HAV), feasibility and justification of robotic pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD) for periampullary lesions have been not been well established. A total of 600 patients with periampullary lesions receiving RPD or open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) were identified from our prospectively collected computer database. Surgical outcomes, oncological radicality, and survival outcomes after RPD in HAV ( +) and (-) patients were compared. The incidence of HAV was 16%, including 12.7% in patients with RPD and 23.0% in those with OPD. In the HAV ( +) group, vascular injury rate had no statistical difference between the RPD (3.7%) and OPD (9.1%) patients, P = 0.404. Among the RPD patients, those with HAV ( +) had longer operation time (8.5 ± 2.5 vs. 7.7 ± 2.0 h, P = 0.013) and higher vascular injury (3.8% vs. 0.6%, P = 0.024) when compared with the HAV (-) patients. There was no significant difference between the HAV ( +) and (-) patients with RPD regarding blood loss, open conversion, vascular resection, and surgical mortality and morbidity. There was no survival difference between the HAV ( +) and (-) patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma after RPD. There was no survival difference between RPD and OPD in the HAV ( +) group.

Radiomics analysis for prediction of lymph node metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on pretreatment MRI in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.,"This study aims to develop and validate a pretreatment MRI-based radiomics model to predict lymph node metastasis (LNM) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Patients with LACC who underwent NACT from two centers between 2013 and 2022 were enrolled retrospectively. Based on the lymph node (LN) status determined in the pathology reports after radical hysterectomy, patients were categorized as LN positive or negative. The patients from center 1 were assigned as the training set while those from center 2 formed the validation set. Radiomics features were extracted from pretreatment sagittal T2-weighted imaging (Sag-T2WI), axial diffusion-weighted imaging (Ax-DWI), and the delayed phase of dynamic contrast-enhanced sagittal T1-weighted imaging (Sag-T1C) for each patient. The K-best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were employed to reduce dimensionality, and the radiomics features strongly associated with LNM were selected and used to construct three single-sequence models. Furthermore, clinical variables were incorporated through multivariate regression analysis and fused with the selected radiomics features to construct the clinical-radiomics combined model. The diagnostic performance of the models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The clinical utility of the models was evaluated by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 282 patients were included, comprising 171 patients in the training set, and 111 patients in the validation set. Compared to the Sag-T2WI model (AUC, 95%CI, training set, 0.797, 0.722-0.782; validation set, 0.648, 0.521-0.776) and the Sag-T1C model (AUC, 95%CI, training set, 0.802, 0.723-0.882; validation set, 0.630, 0.505-0.756), the Ax-DWI model exhibited the highest diagnostic performance with AUCs of 0.855 (95%CI, 0.791-0.919) in training set, and 0.753 (95%CI, 0.638-0.867) in validation set, respectively.

"Alterations in regulators of the renal-bone axis, inflammation and iron status in older people with early renal impairment and the effect of vitamin D supplementation.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to alterations in fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and the renal-bone axis. This may be partly driven by altered inflammation and iron status. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce inflammation. Older adults with early CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 30-60 ml/min/1.73 m2; CKDG3a/b; n = 35) or normal renal function (eGFR >90 ml/min/1.73 m2; CKDG1; n = 35) received 12,000, 24,000 or 48,000 IU D3/month for 1 year. Markers of the renal-bone axis, inflammation and iron status were investigated pre- and post-supplementation. Predictors of c-terminal and intact FGF23 (cFGF23; iFGF23) were identified by univariate and multivariate regression. Pre-supplementation, comparing CKDG3a/b to CKDG1, plasma cFGF23, iFGF23, PTH, sclerostin and TNFα were significantly higher and Klotho, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and iron were lower. Post-supplementation, only cFGF23, 25(OH)D and IL6 differed between groups. The response to supplementation differed between eGFR groups. Only in the CKDG1 group, phosphate decreased, cFGF23, iFGF23 and procollagen type I N-propeptide increased. In the CKDG3a/b group, TNFα significantly decreased, and iron increased. Plasma 25(OH)D and IL10 increased, and carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks decreased in both groups. In univariate models cFGF23 and iFGF23 were predicted by eGFR and regulators of calcium and phosphate metabolism at both time points; IL6 predicted cFGF23 (post-supplementation) and iFGF23 (pre-supplementation) in univariate models. Hepcidin predicted post-supplementation cFGF23 in multivariate models with eGFR. Alterations in regulators of the renal-bone axis, inflammation and iron status were found in early CKD.

Associations of meeting 24-hour movement behavior guidelines with social and emotional function in youth with ASD/ADHD.,"The 24-hour movement behavior (24-HMB) guidelines recommend that children and adolescents should limit screen time (ST), get an adequate amount of sleep (SL), and engage in sufficient physical activity (PA) to ensure health and healthy development. Meeting 24-HMB guidelines is associated with positive mental health outcomes (e.g., social and emotional function) in the general population. However, it is unclear whether such findings extend to children and adolescents with comorbid Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Thus, we examined associations of meeting 24-HMB guidelines with social and emotional function in children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD. Data from the 2020-2021 National Survey of Children's Health - a U.S. national, population-based, cross-sectional study - were used. We extracted and analyzed data on children and adolescents (aged between 6 and 17 years) diagnosed with comorbidity of ASD/ADHD. Data on movement behaviors (PA, ST, and SL) and specific outcome variables (social function and emotional function) were collected through caregiver-proxy reports. Logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between meeting 24-HMB guidelines and social and emotional outcomes adjusting for covariates (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity, weight status, birth status, socio-economic status, and receiving medication/behavioral treatment). Among 979 children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD, only 3.8 % met all three 24-HMB guidelines. In total, 45.0 % of participants met at least one guideline, and 25.5 % of those met at least two guidelines. Compared to those who did not meet any 24-HMB guidelines, meeting SL + ST guidelines was significantly associated with lower odds of poorer social function (being bullied: OR = 0.3, 95%CI [0.1-0.7]; arguing: OR = 0.2, 95%CI[0.1-0.4]). Furthermore, meeting PA + ST + SL guidelines was associated with lower odds of poorer emotional function (depression: OR = 0.5, 95%CI[0.3-0.7]). Meeting 24-HMB guidelines was associated with better social and emotional function in U.S. children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD; however, currently very few with comorbid ASD/ADHD meet all 24-HMB guidelines. These results emphasize the importance of promoting adherence to the 24-HMB guidelines among children and adolescents facing the challenges of comorbid ASD/ADHD. These cross-sectional findings point to the need for further empirical evidence from longitudinal studies to support our conclusions.",['Zhao M; Hou M; Herold F; Chen Y; Werneck AO; Block ME; Kramer AF; Taylor A; Cunha PM; Chaput JP; Falck RS; Owen N; Zou L'],2024,meeting 24-HMB guidelines is associated with positive mental health outcomes. it is unclear whether such findings extend to children and adolescents with comorbid ASD/ADHD.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex metabolic disorder driving health and socioeconomic challenges worldwide. It may be characterized by insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This study aims to conduct a review of pomegranate's effects on MetS parameters using a mechanistic approach relying on pre-clinical studies. The peel, juice, roots, bark, seeds, flowers, and leaves of the fruit present several bioactive compounds that are related mainly to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as cardioprotective, antidiabetic, and antiobesity effects. The use of the juice extract can work as a potent inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme activities, consequently regulating blood pressure. The major bioactive compounds found within the fruit are phenolic compounds (hydrolysable tannins and flavonoids) and fatty acids. Alkaloids, punicalagin, ellagitannins, ellagic acid, anthocyanins, tannins, flavonoids, luteolin, and punicic acid are also present. The antihyperglycemia, antihyperlipidemia, and weight loss promoting effects are likely related to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. When considering clinical application, pomegranate extracts are found to be frequently well-tolerated, further supporting its efficacy as a treatment modality. We suggest that pomegranate fruit, extract, or processed products can be used to counteract MetS-related risk factors. This review represents an important step towards exploring potential avenues for further research in this area.",['Laurindo LF; Rodrigues VD; Minniti G; de Carvalho ACA; Zutin TLM; DeLiberto LK; Bishayee A; Barbalho SM'],2024,"pomegranate extracts are found to be well-tolerated. the fruit may be characterized by insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia."
Structure and function of the ROR2 cysteine-rich domain in vertebrate noncanonical WNT5A signaling.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase ROR2 mediates noncanonical WNT5A signaling to orchestrate tissue morphogenetic processes, and dysfunction of the pathway causes Robinow syndrome, Brachydactyly B and metastatic diseases. The domain(s) and mechanisms required for ROR2 function, however, remain unclear. We solved the crystal structure of the extracellular cysteine-rich (CRD) and Kringle (Kr) domains of ROR2 and found that, unlike other CRDs, the ROR2 CRD lacks the signature hydrophobic pocket that binds lipids/lipid-modified proteins, such as WNTs, suggesting a novel mechanism of ligand reception. Functionally, we showed that the ROR2 CRD, but not other domains, is required and minimally sufficient to promote WNT5A signaling, and Robinow mutations in the CRD and the adjacent Kr impair ROR2 secretion and function. Moreover, using function-activating and -perturbing antibodies against the Frizzled (FZ) family of WNT receptors, we demonstrate the involvement of FZ in WNT5A-ROR signaling. Thus, ROR2 acts via its CRD to potentiate the function of a receptor super-complex that includes FZ to transduce WNT5A signals.",['Griffiths SC; Tan J; Wagner A; Blazer LL; Adams JJ; Srinivasan S; Moghisaei S; Sidhu SS; Siebold C; Ho HH'],2024,the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR2 mediates noncanonical WNT5A signaling to orchestrate tissue morphogenetic processes. the receptor tyrosine kinase mediates noncanonical WNT5A signaling to orchestrate tissue morphogenetic processes. the receptor tyrosine kinase ROR2 mediates noncanonical WNT5A signaling to orchestrate tissue morphogenetic processes
Synergistic effects of cognitive frailty and comorbidities on disability: a community-based longitudinal study.,"In this study, we aimed to assess the synergistic effects of cognitive frailty (CF) and comorbidity on disability among older adults. Out of the 1318 participants from the Malaysian Towards Useful Aging (TUA) study, only 400 were included in the five-year follow-up analysis. A comprehensive interview-based questionnaire covering socio-demographic information, health status, biochemical indices, cognitive and physical function, and psychosocial factors was administered. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to estimate the independent and combined odd ratios (ORs). Measures such as the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), the attributable proportion of risk due to the interaction, and the synergy index were used to assess the interaction between CF and comorbidity. Participants with CF (24.1%) were more likely to report disability compared to those without CF (10.3%). Synergistic effects impacting disability were observed between CF and osteoarthritis (OA) (OR: 6.675, 95% CI: 1.057-42.158; RERI: 1.501, 95% CI: 1.400-1.570), CF and heart diseases (HD) (OR: 3.480, 95% CI: 1.378-8.786; RERI: 0.875, 95% CI: 0.831-0.919), CF and depressive symptoms (OR: 3.443, 95% CI: 1.065-11.126; RERI: 0.806, 95% CI: 0.753-0.859), and between CF and diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR: 2.904, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.487-5.671; RERI: 0.607, 95% CI: 0.577-0.637). These findings highlight the synergism between the co-existence of CF and comorbidity, including OA, HD, DM, and depressive symptoms, on disability in older adults. Screening, assessing, and managing comorbidities, especially OA, HD, DM and depressive symptoms, when managing older adults with CF are crucial for reducing the risk of or preventing the development of disability.",['Fatin Malek Rivan N; Murukesu RR; Shahar S; Fadilah Rajab N; Subramaniam P; Choon Ooi T; Zul Amin Kamaruddin M; Singh DKA'],2024,"out of 1318 participants from the study, only 400 were included in the five-year follow-up analysis. a comprehensive interview-based questionnaire was administered."
A bioactive nanocomposite integrated specific TAMs target and synergistic TAMs repolarization for effective cancer immunotherapy.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from photosensitizers exhibit great potential for repolarizing immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the anti-tumor M1 phenotype, representing a promising cancer immunotherapy strategy. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in eliminating solid tumors is generally limited by the instability and inadequate TAMs-specific targeting of photosensitizers. Here, a novel core-shell integrated nano platform is proposed to achieve a coordinated strategy of repolarizing TAMs for potentiating cancer immunotherapy. Colloidal mesoporous silica nanoparticles (CMSN) are fabricated to encapsulate photosensitizer-Indocyanine Green (ICG) to improve their stability. Then ginseng-derived exosome (GsE) was coated on the surface of ICG/CMSN for targeting TAMs, as well as repolarizing TAMs concurrently, named ICG/CMSN@GsE. As expected, with the synergism of ICG and GsE, ICG/CMSN@GsE exhibited better stability, mild generation of ROS, favorable specificity toward M2-like macrophages, enhancing drug retention in tumors and superior TAMs repolarization potency, then exerted a potent antitumor effect. <i>In vivo</i>, experiment results also confirm the synergistic suppression of tumor growth accompanied by the increased presence of anti-tumor M1-like macrophages and maximal tumor damage. Taken together, by integrating the superiorities of TAMs targeting specificity and synergistic TAMs repolarization effect into a single nanoplatform, ICG/CMSN@GsE can readily serve as a safe and high-performance nanoplatform for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.",['Gu W; Guo W; Ren Z; Zhang Y; Han M; Zhao Q; Gao Y; Mao Y; Wang S'],2024,photoensitizers have a promising cancer immunotherapy strategy. a novel core-shell integrated nano platform is proposed to achieve a coordinated strategy of repolarizing TAMs for potentiating cancer immunotherapy.
Triglyceride glucose index and triglyceride HDL ratio as predictors of coronary artery stenosis in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.,"The current study investigated the association between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and triglyceride/HDL-C indices and coronary atherosclerosis extent in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. In this case-control study, 1538 individuals were classified into two groups: diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Each group was further grouped as follows: (1) angiography+ (2) angiography-and (3) subjects without a history of cardiovascular diseases. The TyG and TG/HDL-C indices were compared between the subgroups of the diabetic (n = 407) and non-diabetic (n = 1131) groups. In both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, there was no significant association in TG/HDL-C; and diabetic subjects, angiography+ and angiography-groups had significantly higher TyG (p < 0.05). A high TyG index was associated with a higher risk of angiography+ (OR: 1.883 (1.410-2.514)). The TyG index, but not the TG/HDL-C, was an independent marker for predicting the severity of coronary stenosis in non-diabetic patients.",['Darroudi S; Mahdavizadeh V; Mirzaei AH; Esparham A; Ahmadyar S; Esmaily H; Ferns GA; Moohebati M'],2023,study investigated the association between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and triglyceride/HDL-C indices and coronary atherosclerosis extent in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. each group was further grouped as follows: (1) angiography+ (2) angiography-and (3) subjects without a history of cardiovascular diseases.
Effect of metformin use on graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review protocol.,"Metformin is a first-line antihyperglycaemic agent for type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In addition to glycaemic control, it offers benefits related to cardiovascular health, weight neutrality and metabolic syndrome. However, its benefits in kidney transplant recipients remain unclear as metformin use is controversial in this population due to a lack of evidence and there are recommendations against its use in patients with poor kidney function. Hence, we seek to describe a protocol for a systematic review, which will assess the impact of metformin use on graft survival and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. This protocol was guided by the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols 2015. We will search empirical databases such as MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection for relevant studies conducted in kidney transplant recipients using metformin, which report outcomes related to graft and patient survival. All studies meeting these criteria in adults and published in English from inception to 2023 will be included in our review. We will employ the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 for randomised controlled trials and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Intervention for non-randomised studies. We will present our data and study characteristics in a table format and determine if a meta-analysis can be performed by clinical and methodological heterogeneity, using the I<sup>2</sup> statistics. If a meta-analysis cannot be performed, we will provide a narrative synthesis of included studies using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis Reporting Guideline. Ethical approval will not be required for this review as the data used will be extracted from already published studies with publicly accessible data. As this study will assess the impact of metformin use on graft and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients, evidence gathered through it will be disseminated using traditional approaches that include open-access peer-reviewed publication, scientific presentations and a report. We will also disseminate our findings to appropriate academic bodies in charge of publishing guidelines related to T2DM and transplantation, as well as patient and research centred groups.

Evaluating the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells for diabetic neuropathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical studies.,"Diabetic neuropathy affects nearly half of all diabetics and poses a significant threat to public health. Recent preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may represent a promising solution for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. However, an objective assessment of the preclinical effectiveness of MSCs is still pending. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane library to identify preclinical studies that investigate the effects of MSCs on diabetic neuropathy up until 15 September 2023. Outcome indicators consisted of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, intra-epidermal nerve fiber density, sciatic nerve blood flow, capillary-to-muscle fiber ratio, neurotrophic factors, angiogenic factors and inflammatory cytokines. The literature review and meta-analysis were conducted independently by two researchers. 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this system review for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Pooled analyses indicated that MSCs exhibited an evident benefit in diabetic neuropathy in terms of motor (SMD = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.71-2.61) and sensory nerve conduction velocities (SMD = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.78-4.07), intra-epidermal nerve fiber density (SMD = 3.17, 95% CI: 2.28-4.07), sciatic nerve blood flow (SMD = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.37-2.66), and capillary-to-muscle fiber ratio (SMD = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.55 to 3.01, <i>p</i> < 0.00001). Furthermore, after MSC therapy, the expressions of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors increased significantly in most studies, while the levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced. The relevance of this review relies on the fact that summarizes an extensive body of work entailing substantial preclinical evidence that supports the efficacy of MSCs in mitigating diabetic neuropathy. While MSCs emerge as a promising potential treatment for diabetic neuropathy, further research is essential to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and the best administration strategy for MSCs.",['Li Y; Yue G; Yu S; Cheng X; Cao Y; Wang X'],2024,preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stem cells may be a promising solution for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. but an objective assessment of the preclinical effectiveness of MSCs is still pending.
Association of dietary iron intake with diabetic kidney disease among individuals with diabetes.,"The current study investigated the correlation between dietary iron intake and diabetic kidney disease among diabetic adults. This cross-sectional study enrolled 8118 participants who suffered from diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018. Dietary iron intake was obtained from 24 h recall interviews, and diabetic kidney disease was defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/g. Three weighted logistic regression models were utilized to investigate odd ratio (OR) and 95% CIs for diabetic kidney disease. Stratified analyses were performed by gender, age, BMI, HbA1c, hypertension status, and smoking status, and diabetes types. Among 8118 participants (51.6% male, mean age 61.3 years), 40.7% of participants suffered from diabetic kidney disease. With the adjustment of potential covariates, we found that ≥ 12.59 mg of dietary iron was related to a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.96; OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.98). In stratified analyses, higher iron intake was negatively related to diabetic kidney disease, especially among those who were male, < 60 years, those with hypertension, those with HbA1c < 7.0%, and those who were ex-smokers. The result remained robust in sensitivity analyses. We found that ≥ 12.59 mg of dietary iron is associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease, especially in those who were male, younger, heavier weight, have better blood sugar control, and those who were ex-smokers.",['Wu Y; Xiao M; Chen J; Tao Y; Chen A; Lin H; Xu Y; Li L; Jia H; Xue Y; Jia Y; Zheng Z'],2024,"study enrolled 8118 participants who suffered from diabetes from the national health and nutrition examination survey. the study was conducted by gender, age, BMI, HbA1c, hypertension status, smoking status, and diabetes types."
"Discovery and validation of plasma, saliva and multi-fluid plasma-saliva metabolomic scores predicting insulin resistance and diabetes progression or regression among Puerto Rican adults.","Many studies have examined the relationship between plasma metabolites and type 2 diabetes progression, but few have explored saliva and multi-fluid metabolites. We used LC/MS to measure plasma (n=1051) and saliva (n=635) metabolites among Puerto Rican adults from the San Juan Overweight Adults Longitudinal Study. We used elastic net regression to identify plasma, saliva and multi-fluid plasma-saliva metabolomic scores predicting baseline HOMA-IR in a training set (n=509) and validated these scores in a testing set (n=340). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs for the association of baseline metabolomic scores predicting insulin resistance with incident type 2 diabetes (n=54) and prediabetes (characterised by impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose and/or high HbA<sub>1c</sub>) (n=130) at 3 years, along with regression from prediabetes to normoglycaemia (n=122), adjusting for traditional diabetes-related risk factors. Plasma, saliva and multi-fluid plasma-saliva metabolomic scores predicting insulin resistance included highly weighted metabolites from fructose, tyrosine, lipid and amino acid metabolism. Each SD increase in the plasma (HR 1.99 [95% CI 1.18, 3.38]; p=0.01) and multi-fluid (1.80 [1.06, 3.07]; p=0.03) metabolomic scores was associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes. The saliva metabolomic score was associated with incident prediabetes (1.48 [1.17, 1.86]; p=0.001). All three metabolomic scores were significantly associated with lower likelihood of regressing from prediabetes to normoglycaemia in models adjusting for adiposity (HRs 0.72 for plasma, 0.78 for saliva and 0.72 for multi-fluid), but associations were attenuated when adjusting for lipid and glycaemic measures. The plasma metabolomic score predicting insulin resistance was more strongly associated with incident type 2 diabetes than the saliva metabolomic score. Only the saliva metabolomic score was associated with incident prediabetes.",['Haslam DE; Liang L; Guo K; Martínez-Lozano M; Pérez CM; Lee CH; Morou-Bermudez E; Clish C; Wong DTW; Manson JE; Hu FB; Stampfer MJ; Joshipura K; Bhupathiraju SN'],2024,LC/MS used elastic net regression to measure plasma (n=1051) and saliva (n=635) metabolites. we used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs.
P4HA2 contributes to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma progression and EMT through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be defined as a deadly illness with a dismal prognosis in advanced stages. Therefore, we seek to examine P4HA2 expression and effect in HNSCC, along with the underlying mechanisms. This study utilized integrated bioinformatics analyses to evaluate the P4HA2 expression pattern, prognostic implication, and probable function in HNSCC. The study conducted various in vitro experiments, including colony formation, CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell assays, on the human HNSCC cell line CAL-27 to examine the involvement of P4HA2 in HNSCC progression. Moreover, western blotting was used to investigate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and PI3K/AKT pathway markers to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. P4HA2 expression was significantly enhanced in HNSCC, and its overexpression was correlated to tumor aggressiveness and a poor prognosis in patients. Based on in vitro experiments, the overexpressed P4HA2 enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion, as well as EMT while reducing apoptosis, whereas P4HA2 silencing exhibited the reverse effect. P4HA2 overexpression enhanced PI3K/AKT phosphorylation in HNSCC cells. Moreover, LY294002 was observed to counteract the effects of upregulated P4HA2 on proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in HNSCC. Collectively, we indicated that P4HA2 promoted HNSCC progression and EMT via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.",['Wu YL; Liu W; Zhao T; Jin J'],2024,squamous cell carcinoma can be defined as a deadly illness with a dismal prognosis in advanced stages. we seek to examine P4HA2 expression and effect in HNSCC. the study used integrated bioinformatics analyses to evaluate the involvement of P4HA2 in HNSCC progression.
Association between immune-related adverse events and prognosis in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provides a variety of options for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). After the application of ICIs, the immune system of patients was highly activated, and immune-related adverse events (irAEs) could occur in some organ systems, and irAEs seemed to be associated with the survival prognosis of patients. Therefore, we evaluated the association between survival outcomes and irAEs in NSCLC patients and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted systematic reviews of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases until December 2021. The forest map was constructed by combining the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). I<sup>2</sup> estimated the heterogeneity between studies. A meta-analysis was performed using R 4.2.1 software. Eighteen studies included 4808 patients with advanced NSCLC. In pooled analysis, the occurrence of irAEs was found to be a favorable factor for improved prognosis (PFS: HR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.41-0.55, P <0.01; OS: HR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.42-0.52, P <0.01). In subgroup analyses, cutaneous irAE, gastrointestinal irAE, endocrine irAE and grade ≥3 irAEs were associated with improvements in PFS and OS, but pulmonary and hepatic irAEs were not. Existing evidence suggests that the occurrence of irAEs may be a prognostic biomarker for advanced NSCLC. However, further research is needed to explore the prospect of irAEs as a prognostic biomarker in patients undergoing immunotherapy. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPEROFILES/405333_STRATEGY_20240502.pdf, identifier CRD42023405333.",['Ma S; Nie H; Wei C; Jin C; Wang L'],2024,"emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors provides options for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. after the application of ICIs, the immune system of patients was highly activated. irAEs seemed to be associated with the survival prognosis of patients."
"Medical treatment of functional pituitary adenomas, trials and tribulations.","Functioning pituitary adenomas (FPAs) include most frequently prolactinomas, somatotroph or corticotroph adenomas, while thyrotroph and gonadotroph adenomas are very rare. Despite their benign histological nature (aggressive tumors are rare and malignant ones exceptional), FPAs could cause significant morbidity and increased mortality due to complications associated with hormonal excess syndromes and/or mass effect leading to compression of adjacent structures. This mini review will focus on the increasing role of medical therapy in the multimodal treatment, which also includes transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) and radiotherapy. Most patients with prolactinomas are treated only with medications, but surgery could be considered for some patients in a specialized pituitary center, if higher chances of cure. Dopamine agonists, especially cabergoline, are efficient in reducing tumor size and normalizing prolactin. TSS is the first-line treatment for all other FPAs, but most patients require complex adjuvant treatment, including a combination of therapeutic approaches. Medical therapy is the cornerstone of treatment in all patients after unsuccessful surgery or when surgery cannot be offered and includes somatostatin receptor ligands and dopamine agonists (almost all FPAs), growth hormone receptor antagonists (acromegaly), adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors and glucocorticoid receptor blockers (Cushing's disease). Novel medical treatments, especially for acromegaly and Cushing's disease are under research.

Non-targeted effects of radiation therapy for glioblastoma.,"Radiotherapy is recommended for the treatment of brain tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM) and brain metastases. Various curative and palliative scenarios suggest improved local-regional control. Although the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear, additional therapeutic effects have been described, including proximity and abscopal reactions at the treatment site. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the immune system plays an essential role in regulating the non-targeted effects of radiotherapy for GBM. This article reviews current biological mechanisms for regulating the non-targeted effects caused by external and internal radiotherapy, and how they might be applied in a clinical context. Optimization of therapeutic regimens requires assessment of the complexity of the host immune system on the activity of immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory cells, such as glioma-associated macrophages and microglia. This article also discusses recent preclinical models adapted to post-radiotherapy responses. This narrative review explores and discusses the current status of immune responses both locally <i>via</i> the ""bystander effect"" and remotely <i>via</i> the ""abscopal effect"". Preclinical and clinical observations demonstrate that unirradiated cells, near or far from the irradiation site, can control the tumor response. Nevertheless, previous studies do not address the problem in its global context, and present gaps regarding the link between the role of the immune system in the control of non-targeted effects for different types of radiotherapy and different fractionation schemes applied to GBM. This narrative synthesis of the scientific literature should help to update and critique available preclinical and medical knowledge. Indirectly, it will help formulate new research projects based on the synthesis and interpretation of results from a non-systematic selection of published studies.",['Lerouge L; Ruch A; Pierson J; Thomas N; Barberi-Heyob M'],2024,"radiotherapy is recommended for the treatment of brain tumors such as glioblastoma. additional therapeutic effects have been described, including proximity and abscopal reactions at the treatment site. this article reviews current biological mechanisms for regulating non-targeted effects caused by external and internal radiotherapy."
"Associations of clinical, psychological, and sociodemographic characteristics and ecological momentary assessment completion in the 10-week Hypo-METRICS study: Hypoglycaemia MEasurements ThResholds and ImpaCtS.","Reporting of hypoglycaemia and its impact in clinical studies is often retrospective and subject to recall bias. We developed the Hypo-METRICS app to measure the daily physical, psychological, and social impact of hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes in real-time using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). To help assess its utility, we aimed to determine Hypo-METRICS app completion rates and factors associated with completion. Adults with diabetes recruited into the Hypo-METRICS study were given validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at baseline. Over 10 weeks, they wore a blinded continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and were asked to complete three daily EMAs about hypoglycaemia and aspects of daily functioning, and two weekly sleep and productivity PROMs on the bespoke Hypo-METRICS app. We conducted linear regression to determine factors associated with app engagement, assessed by EMA and PROM completion rates and CGM metrics. In 602 participants (55% men; 54% type 2 diabetes; median(IQR) age 56 (45-66) years; diabetes duration 19 (11-27) years; HbA1c 57 (51-65) mmol/mol), median(IQR) overall app completion rate was 91 (84-96)%, ranging from 90 (81-96)%, 89 (80-94)% and 94(87-97)% for morning, afternoon and evening check-ins, respectively. Older age, routine CGM use, greater time below 3.0 mmol/L, and active sensor time were positively associated with app completion.

FOXS1 acts as an oncogene and induces EMT through FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway by upregulating HILPDA in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a widespread global health concern characterized by elevated rates of occurrence, and there is a need for novel therapeutic targets to enhance patient outcomes. FOXS1 is closely linked to different cancers, but its function in PCa is still unknown. The expression of FOXS1, its prognostic role, clinical significance in PCa, and the potential mechanism by which FOXS1 affects PCa progression were investigated through bioinformatics analysis utilizing public data. The levels of FOXS1 and HILPDA were evaluated in clinical PCa samples using various methods, such as western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. To examine the function and molecular mechanisms of FOXS1 in PCa, a combination of experimental techniques including CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay, Transwell assay, and Co-IP assay were employed. The FOXS1 expression levels were significantly raised in PCa, correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness and an unfavorable prognosis. Regulating FOXS1 expression, whether upregulating or downregulating it, correspondingly enhanced or inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion capabilities of PCa cells. Mechanistically, we detected a direct interaction between FOXS1 and HILPDA, resulting in the pathway activation of FAK/PI3K/AKT and facilitation EMT in PCa cells. FOXS1 collaborates with HILPDA to initiate EMT, thereby facilitating the PCa progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway activation.",['Ren R; Wang H; Xu Y; Wu J; Ma D; Guan W'],2024,"FOXS1 is closely linked to different cancers, but its function in PCa is still unknown. the levels of FOXS1 and HILPDA were evaluated in clinical PCa samples. the levels of FOXS1 and HILPDA were significantly raised in PCa."
"The effects of diabetes, hypertension and subsequent health control behavior on the survival of a Taiwan cohort aged over 50 years.","This study used the Taiwan Longitudinal Study in Aging from 1996 to 2011 to investigate the effects of diabetes, hypertension, and healthy living behaviors of those aged over 50 years on the survival status in Taiwan. Among the 5,131 participants aged 50 years and above in the 1996 survey were included in this study. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to examine the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and related mortality risk in those aged over 50 years. After adjusting for age, gender, education level, diabetes, hypertension, health behavior, and leisure activity, results from the Cox model show that the elderly without diabetes have a lower mortality risk than those with diabetes. Regular exercise was associated with a lower risk of mortality. The hazard ratios of elderly with regular exercise were 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.64-0.96) for two times a week or less, 0.81 (95 % CI: 0.69-0.96) for 3-5 times a week, and 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.77-0.93) for 6 + times a week, respectively. On the other hand, leisure activity positively reduces mortality risk. For example, the hazard ratios of the elderly with watching TV and reading were 0.63 (95 % CI: 0.55-0.72) and 0.80 (95 % CI: 0.72-0.89), respectively.

Goodness-of-fit tests for modified Poisson regression possibly producing fitted values exceeding one in binary outcome analysis.,"Modified Poisson regression, which estimates the regression parameters in the log-binomial regression model using the Poisson quasi-likelihood estimating equation and robust variance, is a useful tool for estimating the adjusted risk and prevalence ratio in binary outcome analysis. Although several goodness-of-fit tests have been developed for other binary regressions, few goodness-of-fit tests are available for modified Poisson regression. In this study, we proposed several goodness-of-fit tests for modified Poisson regression, including the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test with empirical variance, Tsiatis test, normalized Pearson chi-square tests with binomial variance and Poisson variance, and normalized residual sum of squares test. The original Hosmer-Lemeshow test and normalized Pearson chi-square test with binomial variance are inappropriate for the modified Poisson regression, which can produce a fitted value exceeding 1 owing to the unconstrained parameter space. A simulation study revealed that the normalized residual sum of squares test performed well regarding the type I error probability and the power for a wrong link function. We applied the proposed goodness-of-fit tests to the analysis of cross-sectional data of patients with cancer. We recommend the normalized residual sum of squares test as a goodness-of-fit test in the modified Poisson regression.",['Hagiwara Y; Matsuyama Y'],2024,"modified Poisson regression estimates the regression parameters in the log-binomial regression model. the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test with empirical variance, the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test with binomial variance and the normalized Pearson chi-square test with binomial variance are inappropriate for the modified Poisson regression."
Assessing Muscular Pain and Ergonomics Among Robotic Surgeons in China: A Validation.,"Robotic surgery has transformed minimally invasive procedures, offering precision and efficiency. However, the ergonomic aspects of robotic consoles and their impact on surgeon health remain understudied. This review investigates the burden of ergonomics and muscle fatigue among robotic surgeons in China, comparing the findings to a multinational study. A literature review identified themes related to physical discomfort in robotic surgery. A questionnaire was administered to Chinese robotic surgeons, yielding 40 responses. The study assessed demographic characteristics, surgeon experience, ergonomic practices, reported discomfort, and pain-relief mechanisms. The study revealed that most surgeons experienced shoulder and neck pain, with mixed opinions on whether robotic surgery was the primary cause. Stretching exercises were commonly used for pain relief. Surgeons believed that case volume and surgery duration contributed to discomfort. Comparisons with a multinational study suggested potential demographic and experience-related differences. While the study has limitations, including a small sample size and potential translation issues, it underscores the importance of addressing ergonomic concerns and providing proper training to robotic surgeons to ensure their well-being and longevity in the field. Further research with larger cohorts and platform-specific analyses is warranted.",['Saikali S; Patel E; Mascarenhas A; Jaber A; Gamal A; Moschovas MC; Cui L; Li X; Patel V'],2024,"study assessed demographic characteristics, surgeon experience, ergonomic practices, reported discomfort, and pain-relief mechanisms. most surgeons experienced shoulder and neck pain, with mixed opinions on whether robotic surgery was the primary cause."
Unveiling novel metabolic alterations in postmenopausal osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus through NMR-based metabolomics: A pioneering approach for identifying early diagnostic markers.,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently coexist in postmenopausal women. The study aimed to explore metabolic variations linked to these circumstances and their simultaneous presence through proton nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (<sup>1</sup>H NMR). Serum samples from 80 postmenopausal women, including 20 PMO individuals, 20 T2DM, 20 T2DM + PMO, and 20 healthy postmenopausal women, were analyzed using <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy. Our study revealed significant metabolic profile differences among the four groups. Notably, the T2DM + PMO group showed elevated levels of alanine, pyruvate, glutamate, lactate, and aspartate, indicating their involvement in lipid metabolism, energy, and amino acids. Importantly, our multivariate statistical analysis identified a metabolite set that accurately distinguished the groups, suggesting its potential as an early diagnostic marker. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolomics approach uncovered metabolic biomarkers intricately linked to postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and their concurrent presence. Among these biomarkers, alanine emerged as a pivotal player, showing its significant role in the metabolic landscape associated with PMO and T2DM. These findings shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions and underscore alanine's potential as a diagnostic biomarker.",['Kaur S; Kumari P; Singh G; Joshi N; Kaur T; Dhiman V; Singh G; Sachdeva N; Kumar D; Barnwal RP; Bhadada SK'],2024,"postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) frequently coexist in postmenopausal women. alanine emerged as a pivotal player, showing its significant role in the metabolic landscape associated with PMO and T2DM."
Tweaking the NRF2 signaling cascade in human myelogenous leukemia cells by artificial nano-organelles.,"NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2) is a key regulator of genes involved in the cell's protective response to oxidative stress. Upon activation by disturbed redox homeostasis, NRF2 promotes the expression of metabolic enzymes to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cell internalization of peroxisome-like artificial organelles that harbor redox-regulating enzymes was previously shown to reduce ROS-induced stress and thus cell death. However, if and to which extent ROS degradation by such nanocompartments interferes with redox signaling pathways is largely unknown. Here, we advance the design of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-degrading artificial nano-organelles (AnOs) that exposed surface-attached cell penetrating peptides (CPP) for enhanced uptake and were equipped with a fluorescent moiety for rapid visualization within cells. To investigate how such AnOs integrate in cellular redox signaling, we engineered leukemic K562 cells that report on NRF2 activation by increased mCherry expression. Once internalized, ROS-metabolizing AnOs dampen intracellular NRF2 signaling upon oxidative injury by degrading H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, intracellular AnOs conferred protection against ROSinduced cell death in conditions when endogenous ROS-protection mechanisms have been compromised by depletion of glutathione or knockdown of NRF2. We demonstrate CPP-facilitated AnO uptake and AnO-mediated protection against ROS insults also in the T lymphocyte population of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Overall, our data suggest that intracellular AnOs alleviated cellular stress by the on-site reduction of ROS.",['Wolf KMP; Maffeis V; Schoenenberger CA; Zünd T; Bar-Peled L; Palivan CG; Vogel V'],2024,"a key regulator of genes involved in the cell's protective response to oxidative stress is NRF2. a cell internalization of artificial organelles was previously shown to reduce ROS-induced stress and thus cell death. however, if and to which extent ROS degradation by such nanocompartments interferes with redox signaling pathways is largely unknown."
A dynamic probabilistic model of the onset and interaction of cardio-metabolic comorbidities on an ageing adult population.,"Comorbidity is widespread in the ageing population, implying multiple and complex medical needs for individuals and a public health burden. Determining risk factors and predicting comorbidity development can help identify at-risk subjects and design prevention strategies. Using socio-demographic and clinical data from approximately 11,000 subjects monitored over 11 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities, namely type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and heart problems. The DBN allows us to identify risk factors for developing each morbidity, simulate ageing progression over time, and stratify the population based on the risk of outcome occurrence. By applying hierarchical agglomerative clustering to the simulated, dynamic risk of experiencing morbidities, we identified patients with similar risk patterns and the variables contributing to their discrimination. The network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time, such as the impact of fasting glucose, HbA1c, and BMI on T2D development. Mediated cross-relationships between comorbidities also emerge, showcasing the interconnected nature of these health issues. The model presents good calibration and discrimination ability, particularly in predicting the onset of T2D (iAUC-ROC = 0.828, iAUC-PR = 0.294) and survival (iAUC-ROC = 0.827, iAUC-PR = 0.311). Stratification analysis unveils two distinct clusters for all comorbidities, effectively discriminated by variables like HbA1c for T2D and age at baseline for heart problems. The developed DBN constitutes an effective, highly-explainable predictive risk tool for simulating and stratifying the dynamic risk of developing cardio-metabolic comorbidities. Its use could help identify the effects of risk factors and develop health policies that prevent the occurrence of comorbidities.",['Roversi C; Tavazzi E; Vettoretti M; Di Camillo B'],2024,a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is developed to model the onset and interaction of three cardio-metabolic comorbidities. the network reveals a direct joint effect of biomarkers and lifestyle on outcomes over time.

"The complexity of glucose time series is associated with short- and long-term mortality in critically ill adults: a multi-center, prospective, observational study.","The wealth of data taken from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) remains to be fully used. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between a promising new CGM metric, complexity of glucose time series index (CGI), and mortality in critically ill patients. A total of 293 patients admitted to mixed medical/surgical intensive care units from 5 medical centers in Shanghai were prospectively included between May 2020 and November 2021. CGI was assessed using intermittently scanned CGM, with a median monitoring period of 12.0 days. Outcome measures included short- and long-term mortality. During a median follow-up period of 1.7 years, a total of 139 (47.4%) deaths were identified, of which 73 (24.9%) occurred within the first 30 days after ICU admission, and 103 (35.2%) within 90 days. The multivariable-adjusted HRs for 30-day mortality across ascending tertiles of CGI were 1.00 (reference), 0.68 (95% CI 0.38-1.22) and 0.36 (95% CI 0.19-0.70), respectively. For per 1-SD increase in CGI, the risk of 30-day mortality was decreased by 51% (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35-0.69). Further adjustment for HbA1c, mean glucose during hospitalization and glucose variability partially attenuated these associations, although the link between CGI and 30-day mortality remained significant (per 1-SD increase: HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40-0.83). Similar results were observed when 90-day mortality was considered as the outcome. Furthermore, CGI was also significantly and independently associated with long-term mortality (per 1-SD increase: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.97).

Endometrial Cancer Survival in Populations of African Descent.,"To examine whether the endometrial cancer (EC) survival disadvantage among Black populations is US-specific, a comparison between African descent populations from different countries with a high development index is warranted. We analyzed 28,213 EC cases from cancer registries in Florida (2005-2018) and Martinique (2005-2018)/Guadeloupe (2008-2018), French Caribbean islands. Kaplan-Meier and all-cause Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare survival. Models were stratified by EC histology type and the main predictor examined was race/ethnicity [non-Hispanic White (NHW) and Black (NHB) women in the US versus Black women residing in the Caribbean]. For endometrioid and non-endometrioid EC, after adjusting for age, histology, stage at diagnosis, receipt of surgery, period of diagnosis, and poverty level, US NHB women and Caribbean Blacks had a higher risk of death relative to US NHWs. There was no difference between US NHBs and Caribbean Blacks (HR 1.07, 95% CI: 0.88-1.30) with endometrioid EC. However, Caribbean Black women with non-endometrioid carcinomas had a 40% (HR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.13-1.74) higher risk of death than US NHBs. The low EC survival among US Black women extends to foreign populations of African descent.

Understanding the link between different types of maternal diabetes and the onset of autism spectrum disorders.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) encompass a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders that exhibit impaired social interactions and repetitive stereotypic behaviors. Although the exact cause of these disorders remains unknown, it is widely accepted that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to their onset and progression. Recent studies have highlighted the potential negative impact of maternal diabetes on embryonic neurodevelopment, suggesting that intrauterine hyperglycemia could pose an additional risk to early brain development and contribute to the development of ASD. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the current research on the relationship between various forms of maternal diabetes, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes mellitus, and the likelihood of ASD in offspring. The study elucidates the potential mechanisms through which maternal hyperglycemia affects fetal development, involving metabolic hormones, immune dysregulation, heightened oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations. The findings of this review offer valuable insights for potential preventive measures and evidence-based interventions targeting ASD.",['Shao W; Su Y; Liu J; Liu YL; Zhao J; Fan X'],2024,autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include a collection of disorders that exhibit impaired social interactions and repetitive stereotypic behaviors. both genetic and environmental factors contribute to their onset and progression. recent studies have highlighted potential negative impact of maternal diabetes on embryonic neurodevelopment.
"Effect of a Theory-Based Narrative Video on Colorectal Cancer Screening Intention, Knowledge, and Psychosocial Variables Among a Predominantly Hispanic Population.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third leading cause of cancer death in the USA. Latinx adults are overrepresented in late-stage CRC diagnosis as CRC screening utilization remains low among Latinx-identifying individuals. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a theory-based narrative video following a culturally appropriate storyline on CRC screening intention, knowledge, and psychosocial variables along the U.S.-Mexico border. We designed and analyzed a non-randomized pre-posttest evaluation of a narrative, culturally tailored video embedded within a community program. The study is set in the U.S.-Mexico border community. Outreach provided a link or QR code to access the survey. In all, 458 participants started the survey, and 304 completed the survey. Participants were recruited through flyers distributed throughout various community events by the program's community health workers and via social media. The intervention evaluated changes in participant's knowledge, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and perceived benefits and intention to screen. Participants were a mean age of 39 and identified mainly as female (72.7%) and Hispanic/Latinx (88.49%). After viewing the narrative video, participants had significantly improved perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy, and benefits, while perceived barriers and sense of fatalism significantly decreased. Paradoxically, this was associated with a significant decrease in knowledge scores. Results from this intervention suggest that a theory-based narrative video following a culturally appropriate storyline effectively improves psychosocial variables and intention to carry out CRC screening in a predominantly Hispanic border population.",['Okopie T; Calderon-Mora J; Shokar N; Molokwu J'],2024,"colorectal cancer remains the third leading cause of cancer death in the united states. the study aims to evaluate the effect of a theory-based narrative video following a culturally appropriate storyline on CRC screening intention, knowledge, and psychosocial variables along the border."
"Communication between Caregivers of Adults with Cancer and Healthcare Professionals: a Review of Communication Experiences, Associated Factors, Outcomes, and Interventions.","Family/unpaid caregivers play an important role in cancer care. This review aims to summarize caregiver communication experiences with healthcare professionals (HCPs). The Caregiver-Centered Communication model defines five core functions that HCPs should achieve when interacting with caregivers, including fostering relationships, exchanging information, recognizing and responding to caregiver emotions, aiding in decision making, and assisting in patient care management. The literature shows that caregivers have both positive and negative communication experiences with HCPs with respect to these five core functions. Factors at the caregiver (e.g., demographic characteristics, information sources, caregiving duration, health status), patient (e.g., demographic and clinical characteristics), and HCP levels (e.g., time constraints in clinical settings, communication skills) are associated with caregiver-HCP communication quality. Studies further show that these communication experiences may affect caregiver outcomes, including quality of life, mental health, resilience, and satisfaction with cancer care. Moreover, poor quality caregiver-HCP communication is associated with patient readmission to the hospital and unmet care needs. Interventions for caregivers or patient-caregiver dyads have been shown to enhance caregiver confidence and increase their engagement in communication with HCPs. Interventions for HCPs have shown efficacy in improving their communication skills, particularly in involving caregivers in decision-making discussions. Given time constraints during medical visits, we suggest conducting a caregiver assessment by navigators prior to visits to understand their communication needs. Additionally, reimbursing HCPs for time spent communicating with caregivers during visits could be beneficial. More research is needed to better understand how to enhance caregiver-HCP communication quality.",['Wang Y; Seplaki CL; Norton SA; Williams AM; Kadambi S; Loh KP'],2024,caregiver communication experiences with healthcare professionals (HCPs) are key functions in cancer care. caregivers have positive and negative communication experiences with HCPs.
Rechallenge with Anti-EGFR Treatment in RAS/BRAF wt Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) in Real Clinical Practice: Experience of the GITuD Group.,"There are few third- and fourth-line therapeutic options for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In RAS/BRAF wild-type (wt) mCRC previously treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) (first-line) and relapsed after a good response, retreatment with anti-EGFR (rechallenge) emerges as a therapeutic alternative. The aim was to show the activity and safety of anti-EGFR rechallenge in RAS/BRAF wt mCRC in real-world practice. A multicenter, retrospective, observational study (six hospitals of the Galician Group of Research in Digestive Tumors) was conducted. Adult patients with RAS/BRAF wt mCRC, evaluated by liquid biopsy, were included. They received anti-EGFR rechallenge (cetuximab, panitumumab) as monotherapy, or combined with chemotherapy, in third- or subsequent lines. Efficacy (overall response rate [ORR], disease control rate [DCR], overall survival [OS], and progression-free survival [PFS]) and safety (incidence of adverse events [AEs]) were assessed. Thirty-one patients were analyzed. Rechallenge (median 6 cycles [range 1-27], mainly cetuximab [80.7%]), started at a median anti-EGFR-free time of 18.4 months (1.7-37.5 months) after two (38.7%) or more (61.3%) lines of treatment; 64.5% of patients received a full dose. Median OS and PFS were 9.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.2-11.4) and 2.6 months (95% CI 1.7-3.4), respectively. ORR was 10%, and DCR was 30%.

[Analysis of predictive factors for non-adherence to organized screening for colorectal and breast cancers in the pre-pandemic period (2018-2019) in Lombardy Region (Northern Italy)].,"according to the International Agency for Cancer Research on Cancer, in 2022, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the Italian population, followed by colorectal cancer. Oncological screenings represent an effective secondary prevention strategy to counteract colorectal and breast cancers, significantly reducing mortality. In Lombardy Region (Northern Italy), screening programmes have been active since 2007, but adherence, especially in specific population subgroups, remains lower than expected. to analyse potential predictors of non-adherence to colorectal and breast cancer screening in the Lombardy Region during the pre-pandemic period of 2018-2019. a retrospective cohort study aimed at investigating the role of sociodemographic variables, health status, and access to the healthcare system on non-adherence to colorectal and breast cancer screening. Statistical analyses were conducted separately by each Agency for Health Protection (ATS). The results of the models were synthesized across the Lombardy region through random-effects meta-analysis. residents within the territory of each ATS in Lombardy as of 01.01.2018 and aged between 49 and 69 years at the beginning of the follow-up. adherence to colorectal and breast cancer screenings. during the study period, across the Lombardy Region, 2,820,138 individuals were eligible to participate in colorectal cancer screening, and 1,357,344 women were eligible to participate in breast cancer screening, with an invitation coverage of 87% and 86%, respectively.For breast cancer screening, older age, cardiopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), autoimmune diseases, and presence of a rare disease are associated with a reduced risk of non-adherence. Conversely, foreign citizenship, oncological diagnosis, transplant, chronic kidney disease/dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, arterial or cerebral vasculopathy, and presence of a neurological diagnosis are associated with significant excess risks of non-participation. For colorectal cancer screening, factors favouring adherence include female gender, older age, cardiopathy, COPD, autoimmune diseases, and having access/utilization of primary care. Non-adherence is associated with foreign citizenship, transplant, chronic kidney disease/dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, arterial or cerebral vasculopathy, IBD, neurological diseases, residence in assisted living facilities, use of integrated home care, and presence of disability. this is the first study conducted in the Lombardy Region which explores the theme of equity of access to organized screenings. This analysis highlights how sociodemographic determinants, chronic conditions, and access to the healthcare and social healthcare system constitute significant risk factors for non-adherence to screening programmes. Based on the results of this analysis, communication and/or organizational change interventions will be developed to counteract inequalities in access to effective prevention procedures.","[""Russo AG; Murtas R; Ballotari P; Cavalieri d'Oro L; Gambino ML; Fanetti AC; Maifredi G; Manzoni F; Sampietro G; Leoni O; Celata C; Cereda D; Deandrea S""]",2024,"in 2022, breast cancer is the most common cancer in the italian population. in the Lombardy region, screening programmes have been active since 2007. adherence remains lower than expected."

Association of combined healthy lifestyle factors with incident osteoporosis in patients with and without type 2 diabetes.,"The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), lifestyle factors, and the risk of osteoporosis (OP) is well-established. However, the impact of a healthy lifestyle on diabetes-related osteoporosis needs further investigation. Our objective was to explore if a combination of healthy lifestyle factors could mitigate the risk of OP in individuals with type 2 diabetes. This longitudinal analysis included 237,725 middle-aged and older participants. An overall lifestyle score, ranging from 0 to 7, was calculated by assigning a point for each of the seven healthy lifestyle factors, including no current smoking, non-excessive alcohol consumption, regular physical activity, healthy diet, adequate sleep duration, less sedentary behavior, and adequate sunshine exposure. During a median follow-up 12.21 years, 5760 OP cases were documented. Participants with T2DM showed a higher risk of OP than those without diabetes. Compared with participants without diabetes who had a lifestyle score of 6-7, the hazard ratios (HRs) for OP were 1.58 (95% CI 1.23-2.03), 1.62 (95% CI 1.16-2.25), and 2.58 (95% CI 1.64-4.05) for participants with T2DM who had a lifestyle score of 4, 3, and 0-2, respectively. There was a graded association between higher lifestyle scores and lower risks of incident OP among participants without diabetes as well as among those with T2DM.

Mild Autonomous Cortisol Secretion (MACS) - Related Osteoporosis.,"Mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) has thus far been associated with several comorbidities, among which osteoporosis and fractures appear to be highly prevalent. Recent guidelines for adrenal incidentalomas have updated the definition of MACS, currently formulated on serum cortisol after a 1-mg dexamethasone test above 1.8 µg/dL or 50 nmol/L. Previous studies on bone health in adrenal incidentalomas had adopted different definitions of MACS, which produced heterogenous results in terms of fracture prevalence.

Tracking Plasma Membrane Damage Using a Ruthenium(II) Complex Phosphorescent Indicator Paired with Cholesterol.,"Long-term in situ plasma membrane-targeted imaging is highly significant for investigating specific biological processes and functions, especially for the imaging and tracking of apoptosis processes of cells. However, currently developed membrane probes are rarely utilized to monitor the in situ damage of the plasma membrane. Herein, a transition-metal complex phosphorescent indicator, <b>Ru-Chol</b>, effectively paired with cholesterol, exhibits excellent properties on staining the plasma membrane, with excellent antipermeability, good photostability, large Stokes shift, and long luminescence lifetime. In addition, <b>Ru-Chol</b> not only has the potential to differentiate cancerous cells from normal cells but also tracks in real time the entire progression of cisplatin-induced plasma membrane damage and cell apoptosis. Therefore, <b>Ru-Chol</b> can serve as an efficient tool for the monitoring of morphological and physiological changes in the plasma membrane, providing assistance for drug screening and early diagnosis and treatment of diseases, such as immunodeficiency, diabetes, cirrhosis, and tumors.",['Fa Q; Gao X; Zhang W; Ren J; Song B; Yuan J'],2024,membrane probes are rarely used to monitor in situ damage of plasma membrane. b>Ru-Chol/b> can also track apoptosis and cisplatin damage.
Continuous Glucose Monitoring Is Associated with Lower Risk of Diabetic Retinopathy.,"According to this study: In adults with type 1 diabetes, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was associated with lower odds of developing diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.No associations were found between CGM use, insulin pump use, or the use of both CGM and an insulin pump with progression of diabetic retinopathy.",['Rosenberg K'],2024,"continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was associated with lower odds of developing diabetic retinopathy. no association was found between CGM use, insulin pump use or the use of both CGM and an insulin pump with progression of diabetic retinopathy."
Enhanced synthesis of antibody-functionalized gold nanoparticles for multiplexed exosome detection via mass signal amplification in LDI-TOF MS.,"We present a novel method for sensitive exosomal protein detection using organic matrix-free laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF MS) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with mass tags for signal amplification (Am-tags). Target exosomes were captured by specific antibodies on AuNPs and a biochip, where the antibody-presenting AuNPs (Ab/Am-tag@AuNPs) contained excess Am-tags. LDI-TOF MS analysis revealed the mass signal of Am-tags on Ab/Am-tag@AuNPs, indicating the presence of target exosomes. Thus, the target signal was amplified by a large number of Am-tags, resulting in enhanced sensitivity. We optimized the protocol to prepare stable Ab/Am-tag@AuNPs, focusing on parameters such as the concentration and ratio of thiol molecules for AuNP functionalization, suitable solvents for the coupling reaction, and amount of antibodies conjugated to the AuNPs. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of our method to detect exosomes isolated from three cell lines, NIH3T3, MCF7, and HeLa, using an anti-Rab5 immobilized gold chip and anti-CD63/Am-tag@AuNPs with LDI-TOF MS analysis. Calibration curves constructed for the three cell lines showed a linear relationship with an excellent limit of detection. Finally, we emphasized the versatility of our method for the quantitative detection of exosomal proteins CD63 and mucin 1 (MUC1) using two types of Am-tags. LDI-TOF MS analysis revealed the presence of CD63 and MUC1 at different expression levels in HeLa and MCF7 cancer cells. Our findings clearly indicate the potential of Ab/Am-tag@AuNPs as a sensitive and reliable approach for identifying biomarkers in exosomes, providing valuable insights into their utility in biomedical research and clinical settings.",['Jo G; Yeo WS'],2024,LDI-TOF MS analysis revealed mass signal of target exosomes. target exosomes were captured by specific antibodies on AuNPs.

Atovaquone-Proguanil: A Promising Therapy for Persistent Relapsing Babesiosis.,"We report a challenging case of persistent relapsing babesiosis in an immunocompromised host that was successfully managed with atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone). Malignant B-cell transformation and immunosuppressants, such as rituximab, deplete normal B-cells which normally produce antibodies to combat Babesia infection. Treatment can be prolonged and challenging in immunocompromised hosts. Atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) is a novel therapy that can be used as part of a salvage regimen in case antimicrobial resistance or failure exists. Weighing the risks and benefits of continuing cancer therapy treatment or reducing the level of immunosuppression may aid in treatment. These are just as important as the choice of antimicrobial therapy for effective treatment and eradication of Babesia infection, especially in immunocompromised hosts.",['Shahid M; Wechsler B; Parameswaran V; Diaz MA'],2024,atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone) is a novel therapy that can be used as part of a salvage regimen in case antimicrobial resistance exists.
The association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and urinary incontinence among adult females in the United States.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and urinary incontinence (UI) are both highly prevalent and age-related diseases. Nevertheless, the link between NAFLD and UI is unclear. Hence, the study was designed to evaluate the association between the NAFLD and UI (including UI types) in a nationally representative sample of United States (US) female adults. We conducted this study used data from U.S. female adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-March 2020 (pre-pandemic) cycles. The diagnosis of NAFLD is based on Vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and absence of know liver diseases and significant alcohol consumption. The diagnosis and types of UI were assessment using a self-report questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between NALFD and UI. Stratified analyses based on age, obesity, race, educational level, married status, PIR, and smoking status were conducted. Of the 2149 participants, the mean (95% CI) age was 53.9 (52.7-55.0), 686 (61.1%) were Non-Hispanic White. UI was significantly more common in participants with NAFLD [490 (64.7%)] than those without NAFLD [552 (44.9%)]. Adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational level, family poverty income ratio (PIR) status, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), smoking status, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and insulin resistance (IR) in a multivariable logistic regression model, NALFD were associated with UI [OR: 1.93, 95%CI 1.23-3.02, P = 0.01] and urge UI [OR: 1.55, 95%CI 1.03-2.33, P = 0.03], while patients with NAFLD did not show an increased odds in stress UI and mixed UI when compared with those without NAFLD subject (P > 0.05). In the subgroup analyses, NAFLD remained significantly associated with UI, particularly among those participants without obesity (OR: 2.69, 95% CI 1.84-4.00) and aged ≥ 60 years (OR: 2.20, 95% CI 1.38-3.51). Among US female adults, NAFLD has a strong positive correlation with UI. Given that NAFLD is a modifiable disease, these results may help clinicians to target female patients with NAFLD for treatments and interventions that may help prevent the occurrence of UI and reduce the symptoms of UI.",['Li X; Zhou W; Hu G'],2024,the link between the NAFLD and UI is unclear. the study was designed to evaluate the association between the NAFLD and UI. the diagnosis of NAFLD is based on Vibration controlled transient elastography.
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and early diabetic kidney disease exhibit lower computed tomography-measured skeletal muscle attenuation values: a propensity score-matched study.,"To investigate the association between computed tomography (CT)-measured quality characteristics of skeletal muscle (SM) and early diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with T2DM, with and without early DKD, between January 2019 and December 2021. To reduce potential bias, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed. The area and CT attenuation values for SM and different abdominal adipose depots were measured. After PSM, logistic and multiple linear regression analyse were performed to analyse risk factors for early DKD. A total of 267 patients were enrolled (mean age, 61.67 years ±10.87; 155 men) and divided into two groups: T2DM with early DKD (n=133); and T2DM without DKD (n=134). After PSM, 230 patients were matched (T2DM with early DKD [n=115]; and T2DM without DKD [n=115]), with no statistical differences in general characteristics between the two groups (P>0.05). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (odds ratio [OR] 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.49; P=0.002), uric acid (OR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.01; P=0.006), and SM attenuation value (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.90-0.98; P=0.003) were independent risk factors for early DKD. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant correlations between SM attenuation value and cystatin C (β=-0.39, P=0.004), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (β=-0.26, P=0.026), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (β=0.31 P=0.009) after adjustment for confounders. T2DM patients with lower SM attenuation values may exhibit a higher risk for early DKD than those with higher values, which provides a potential imaging biomarker for early DKD diagnosis.",['Fan J; Zuo L; Li F; Wang B; An Y; Yu D'],2024,"retrospective study included patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between January 2019 and December 2021. to reduce potential bias, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed."
Characteristics and quality of clinical practice guidelines for diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review.,"To assess the quality of Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) in the context of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and determine whether any factors affect the quality. We searched eight databases along with five international and national organizations to develop or archive guidelines from their inception to July 2023, with an additional search of medlive.cn. And the authoritative organizations related to nephrology. CPGs and consensus statements created using direct differential diagnosis or therapy for DKD were included without language restrictions. Their quality was evaluated by four reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Ⅱ (AGREE Ⅱ) instrument. Along with the item and domain scores, the guideline was also allocated an overall quality score, which ranged from 1 (lowest possible quality) to 7 (highest possible quality). Moreover, an overall recommendation for use was also assigned (""recommended"", ""recommended with modifications"" or ""not recommended""). A total of 16 CPGs were included, of which 14 were from Asia and the remaining two from Europe. These two CPGs were updated in the third version. Six CPGs were recommended for use because their primary domains scored in the medium or high category. Furthermore, five CPGs were recommended with modifications as the stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence domains were evaluated as low categories. In all domains, the lowest average score was for rigour of development (33%), followed by application (36%), and stakeholder involvement (51%). The highest average score was for scope and purpose (79%), followed by clarity of presentation (75%). None of the CPGs considered the patient's viewpoint, and six of 16 CPGs did not use any grading system to translate the evidence into recommendations. Additionally, only three of 16 CPGs shared search strategy, and eight of 16 CPGs did not declare a funding source. According to the AGREE II evaluation, more than one in four CPGs for DKD had poor methodological quality. Enhanced efforts are needed to advance the rigour of development, application, and editorial independence of DKD guideline panels for most guidelines. Stakeholders, CPG developers, and CPG users should consider methodological quality while choosing CPGs, and interpret and implement their issued suggestions.",['Yuhuang W; Le Z; Zhengshan Z; Zhi Y; Xiyao LI; Luying S; Xing L'],2024,medlive.cn and five international and national organizations developed or archived guidelines. the guidelines were evaluated by four reviewers using the AGREE II instrument. the guidelines were also allocated an overall quality score.

Choosing Wisely in oncology in Latin America: what SLACOM does not recommend in the care of cancer patients in Latin America: Ten essential recommendations to avoid harmful onclogy procedures in Latin America.,"Choosing Wisely is an initiative by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) and ABIM Foundation to deter unnecessary medical treatments and procedures. Faced with the burden of modern technologies and treatments, it is crucial to identify practices lacking value in daily care. The Latin American and Caribbean Society (SLACOM), comprising cancer control experts, deems it vital to tailor this initiative for enhancing cancer care in the region. Through a modified DELPHI methodology involving two rounds of electronic questionnaires and a hybrid meeting to discuss key points of contention, ten essential recommendations were identified and prioritised to avoid harmful oncology procedures in our region.

Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and formation of migrasome increases in the glioma cells induced by the adipokinetic hormone.,"It has been previously shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor is linked with various types of cancer. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is found to be highly expressed in multiple human cancers and associated with tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Adipokinetic hormones are functionally related to the vertebrate glucagon, as they have similar functionalities that manage the nutrient-dependent secretion of these two hormones. Migrasomes are new organelles that contain numerous small vesicles, which aid in transmitting signals between the migrating cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Anax imperator adipokinetic hormone on brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and ultrastructure of cells in the C6 glioma cell line. The rat C6 glioma cells were treated with concentrations of 5 and 10 Anax imperator adipokinetic hormone for 24 h. The effects of the Anax imperator adipokinetic hormone on the migrasome formation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression were analyzed using immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscope. The rat C6 glioma cells of the 5 and 10 μM Anax imperator adipokinetic hormone groups showed significantly high expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and migrasomes numbers, compared with the control group. A positive correlation was found between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression level and the formation of migrasome, which indicates that the increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and the number of migrasomes may be involved to metastasis of the rat C6 glioma cell line induced by the Anax imperator adipokinetic hormone. Therefore, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and migrasome formation may be promising targets for preventing tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in glioma.",['Köktürk S; Doğan S; Yılmaz CE; Cetinkol Y; Mutlu O'],2024,"brain-derived neurotrophic factor is highly expressed in multiple human cancers. it is associated with tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. adipokinetic hormones are functionally related to the vertebrate glucagon."
Comparative safety and cardiovascular effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in nursing homes.,"Studies examining the safety and effectiveness of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) among community-dwelling adults may not generalize to nursing home (NH) residents, who are typically older and more multimorbid. We compared the safety and cardiovascular effectiveness of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs among US NH residents. Eligible individuals were aged ≥66 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and initiated an SGLT2i or GLP-1RA in an NH between 2013 and 2018. Safety outcomes included fall-related injuries, hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), urinary tract infection or genital infection, and acute kidney injury in the year following treatment initiation. Cardiovascular effectiveness outcomes included death, major adverse cardiovascular events and hospitalization for heart failure. Per-protocol adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using stabilized inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted cause-specific hazard regression models accounting for 127 covariates. The study population included 7710 residents (31.08% SGLT2i, 68.92% GLP-1RA). Compared with GLP-1RA initiators, SGLT2i initiators had higher rates of DKA (HR 1.95, 95% confidence limits 1.27, 2.99) and death (HR 1.18, 95% confidence limits 1.02, 1.36). Rates of urinary tract infection or genital infection, acute kidney injury, major adverse cardiovascular events, and heart failure were also elevated, while rates of fall-related injuries and hypoglycaemia were reduced, but all estimates were imprecise and highly compatible with no difference. SGLT2is do not have superior, and may have inferior, effectiveness compared with GLP-1RAs for cardiovascular and mortality outcomes in NH residents. Residents initiating SGLT2is should be monitored closely for DKA.",['Riester MR; Zullo AR; Joshi R; Daiello LA; Hayes KN; Ko D; Kim DH; Munshi M; Berry SD'],2024,"study population included 7710 residents (31.08% SGLT2i, 68.92% GLP-1RA) compared safety and cardiovascular effectiveness of SGLT2is and peptide-1 receptor agonists. compared with SGLT2i initiators, SGLT2i initiators had higher rates of DKA and death."
Cardiovascular risk factors and aortic valve stenosis: towards 10-year absolute risk charts for primary prevention.,"Due to aging populations the incidence of aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is increasing steeply. Since no medical therapy is available but only surgical interventions, it is highly warranted to identify modifiable risk factors for early prevention. The aim of the study was to investigate the associations of cardiovascular risk factors with AVS and to create 10-year absolute risk scores for use in primary prevention. In the Copenhagen General Population Study (N=93,979) lifestyle data, biochemical measures, and confounders were assessed at baseline. Risk factors with the strongest association with aortic valve stenosis from Cox regression analyses were included in ten-year risk prediction models. Ten-year absolute risk scores were conducted using the method of Fine-Gray proportional sub-hazards models, accounting for competing events. 1,132 individuals developed AVS during follow-up. Of well-known cardiovascular risk factors, those that associated with AVS included increasing levels of remnant cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), systolic blood pressure, and body mass index, low adherence to Danish dietary guidelines, current smoking, high alcohol consumption, lipid-lowering therapy and diabetes mellitus. Ten-year absolute risk scores increased when compiling the most important risk factors for AVS; age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, lipoprotein(a), and diabetes. Ten-year absolute risk increased from <1% to 19%. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors is associated with AVS, supporting that this disease, at least partly, may be modifiable through lifestyle changes. Risk charts combining cardiovascular risk factors have the potential to identify high-risk individuals, offering opportunities for preventive strategies. (Word count 245).",['Kjeldsen EW; Thomassen JQ; Rasmussen KL; Nordestgaard BG; Tybjærg-Hansen A; Frikke-Schmidt R'],2024,aortic valve stenosis is a common cause of aging populations. ten-year absolute risk scores were created for use in primary prevention.
Effect of thymoquinone on acetic acid-induced visceral nociception in rats: role of central cannabinoid and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors.,"Thymoquinone (TQ) is the main biologically active substance of <i>Nigella sativa</i> (black seeds). It has anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidative and anti-nociceptive properties. This study was aimed to explore the effect of TQ on acetic acid-induced visceral nociception. The central mechanisms of the effect of TQ were investigated using cannabinergic (AM251) and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic (yohimbine [Yoh]) antagonists. The lateral ventricle of the brain was cannulated for intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections. Visceral nociception was induced by intra-peritoneal (IP) injection of acetic acid (1.00% in a volume of 1.00 mL). Measuring the latency time to the first writhing appearance and counting the number of writhing in 5-min intervals for a period of 60 min were performed. Locomotor activity was determined using an open-field test. Oral administration (PO) of 2.50 and 10.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> TQ increased the latency time to the first writhing appearance and decreased the number of writhing. The AM251 (5.00 µg <i>per</i> rat; ICV) and Yoh (5.00 µg <i>per</i> rat; ICV) partially prevented TQ (10.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>; PO)-induced anti-nociception. Locomotor activity was not altered by these treatments. The results of the present study showed that TQ had the ability to reduce visceral nociception caused by IP injection of acetic acid.

Risk factors for Peri-Implantitis: An Umbrella Review of Meta-Analyses of Observational Studies and Assessment of Biases.,"To perform a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of the findings from previously published meta-analyses and to assess existing biases. A search was conducted for meta-analyses of observational studies investigating the association between any risk factor and peri-implantitis in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Epistemonikos, from inception until October 2023 (PROSPERO: CRD42024512408). From a total of 5002 publications, 51 full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility, and 12 articles that described 41 unique meta-analyses evaluating the association between risk factors and periimplantitis were selected. Among 41 associations, 24 associations were significant. None of the associations were graded as convincing evidence. Two associations, presence of periodontitis (OR=3.84 [95% CI 2.58,5.72]) and cigarette smoking (RR=2.07 [95% CI 1.41,3.04]) were graded as highly suggestive. Eight associations, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, lack of prophylaxis, history of chronic periodontal disease, ongoing or history of periodontal disease, implants located in the anterior region of the jaw (maxillary and mandibular), osteoprotegerin (OPG) gene polymorphisms, and lack of keratinized mucosal width were graded as suggestive evidence. Periodontitis and cigarette smoking are highly suggestive risk factors for peri-implantitis. The remaining risk factors which are suggestive require more high-quality studies to be performed to upgrade the level of evidence. The highly suggestive and suggestive risk factors for peri-implantitis summarized in this umbrella review should be rigorously assessed, monitored and managed by clinicians to reduce the risk peri-implantitis, as well as to form part of the preoperative consent process.",['Giok KC; Veettil SK; Menon RK'],2024,a search was conducted for meta-analyses of observational studies. a total of 5002 publications were evaluated for eligibility. 24 associations were significant.
"The effect of calcaneus and metatarsal head offloading insoles on healthy subjects' gait kinematics, kinetics, asymmetry, and the implications for plantar pressure management: A pilot study.","The global number of people with diabetes is estimated to reach 643 million by 2030 of whom 19-34% will present with diabetic foot ulceration. Insoles which offload high-risk ulcerative regions on the foot, by removing insole material, are the main contemporary conservative treatment to maintain mobility and reduce the likelihood of ulceration. However, their effect on the rest of the foot and relationship with key gait propulsive and balance kinematics and kinetics has not been well researched. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of offloading insoles on gait kinematics, kinetics, and plantar pressure throughout the gait cycle. 10 healthy subjects were recruited for this experiment to walk in 6 different insole conditions. Subjects walked at three speeds on a treadmill for 10 minutes while both plantar pressure and gait kinematics, kinetics were measured using an in-shoe pressure measurement insole and motion capture system/force plates. Average peak plantar pressure, pressure time integrals, gait kinematics and centre of force were analysed. The average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integrals changed by -30% (-68% to 3%) and -36% (-75% to -1%) at the region of interest when applying offloading insoles, whereas the heel strike and toe-off velocity changed by 15% (-6% to 32%) and 12% (-2% to 19%) whilst walking at three speeds. The study found that offloading insoles reduced plantar pressure in the region of interest with loading transferred to surrounding regions increasing the risk of higher pressure time integrals in these locations. Heel strike and toe-off velocities were increased under certain configurations of offloading insoles which may explain the higher plantar pressures and supporting the potential of integrating kinematic gait variables within a more optimal therapeutic approach. However, there was inter-individual variability in responses for all variables measured supporting individualised prescription.",['Shuang J; Haron A; Massey G; Mansoubi M; Dawes H; Bowling FL; Reeves ND; Weightman A; Cooper G'],2024,the global number of people with diabetes is estimated to reach 643 million by 2030. the global number of people with diabetes is estimated to reach 643 million by 2030. the study found offloading insoles reduced plantar pressure in the region of interest.
Surface plasmon resonance microscopy identifies glycan heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer cells that influences mucin-4 binding interactions.,"Membrane proteins are the main targets of therapeutic drugs and most of them are glycosylated. Glycans play pivotal roles in several biological processes, and glycosylation changes are a well-established hallmark of several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer, that contribute to tumor growth. Mucin-4 (MUC-4) is a membrane glycoprotein which is associated with pancreatic cancer and metastasis, and it has been targeted as a promising vaccine candidate. In this study, Surface Plasmon Resonance Microscopy (SPRM) was implemented to study complex influences of the native N-glycan cellular environment on binding interactions to the MUC-4 receptor as this is currently the only commercially available label-free technique with high enough sensitivity and resolution to measure binding kinetics and heterogeneity on single cells. Such unique capability enables for a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" binding interactions on human cancer cells without disrupting the native environment of the target MUC-4 receptor. Removal of N-linked glycans in pancreatic cancer cells using PNGase F exposed heterogeneity in Concanavalin (Con A) binding by revealing three new binding populations with higher affinities than the glycosylated control cells. Anti-MUC-4 binding interactions of enzymatically N-linked deglycosylated pancreatic cancer cells produced a 25x faster association and 37x higher affinity relative to the glycosylated control cells. Lastly, four interaction modes were observed for Helix Pomatia Agglutinin (HPA) binding to the glycosylated control cells, but shifted and increased in activity upon removal of N-linked glycans. These results identified predominant interaction modes of glycan and MUC-4 in pancreatic cancer cells, the kinetics of their binding interactions were quantified, and the influence of N-linked glycans in MUC-4 binding interactions was revealed.",['Aguilar Díaz de León JS; Thirumurty M; Ly N'],2024,membrane glycoproteins are the main targets of therapeutic drugs. membrane glycoproteins are associated with pancreatic cancer. a promising vaccine candidate has been targeted.
Genome-wide analyses reveals an association between invasive urothelial carcinoma in the Shetland sheepdog and NIPAL1.,"Naturally occurring canine invasive urinary carcinoma (iUC) closely resembles human muscle invasive bladder cancer in terms of histopathology, metastases, response to therapy, and low survival rate. The heterogeneous nature of the disease has led to the association of large numbers of risk loci in humans, however most are of small effect. There exists a need for new and accurate animal models of invasive bladder cancer. In dogs, distinct breeds show markedly different rates of iUC, thus presenting an opportunity to identify additional risk factors and overcome the locus heterogeneity encountered in human mapping studies. In the association study presented here, inclusive of 100 Shetland sheepdogs and 58 dogs of other breeds, we identify a homozygous protein altering point mutation within the NIPAL1 gene which increases risk by eight-fold (OR = 8.42, CI = 3.12-22.71), accounting for nearly 30% of iUC risk in the Shetland sheepdog. Inclusion of six additional loci accounts for most of the disease risk in the breed and explains nearly 75% of the phenotypes in this study. When combined with sequence data from tumors, we show that variation in the MAPK signaling pathway is an overarching cause of iUC susceptibility in dogs.",['Parker HG; Harris AC; Plassais J; Dhawan D; Kim EM; Knapp DW; Ostrander EA'],2024,naturally occurring canine invasive urinary carcinoma (iUC) closely resembles human muscle invasive bladder cancer. heterogeneous nature of disease has led to the association of large numbers of risk loci in humans.
Nutritional Challenges and Treatment After Bariatric Surgery.,"Bariatric surgery is an important weight loss tool in individuals with severe obesity. It is currently the most effective long-term weight loss treatment that lowers obesity-related comorbidities. It also has significant physiological and nutritional consequences that can result in gastrointestinal complications and micronutrient deficiencies. After gastric bypass, common clinical events that negatively affect nutritional status include malabsorption, dumping syndrome, kidney stones, altered intestinal bile acid availability, bowel obstruction, ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux, and bacterial overgrowth. Risk factors for poor nutritional status and excessive loss of lean body mass and bone include reduced dietary quality and inadequate intake, altered nutrient absorption, and poor patient compliance with nutrient supplementation.

Enlightenment of robotic gastrectomy from 527 patients with gastric cancer in the minimally invasive era: 5 years of optimizing surgical performance in a high-volume center - a retrospective cohort study.,"Learning curves have been used in the field of RG. However, it should be noted that the previous study did not comprehensively investigate all changes related to the learning curve.This study aims to establish a learning curve for radical robotic gastrectomy (RG) and evaluate its effect on the short-term outcomes of patients with gastric cancer. The clinicopathological data of 527 patients who underwent RG between August 2016 and June 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Learning curves related to the operation time and postoperative hospital stay were determined separately using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Then, the impact of the learning curve on surgical efficacy was analyzed. Combining the CUSUM curve break points and technical optimization time points, the entire cohort was divided into three phases (patients 1-100, 101-250, and 251-527). The postoperative complication rate and postoperative recovery time tended to decrease significantly with phase advancement (P<0.05). More extraperigastric examined lymph nodes (LN) were retrieved in phase III than in phase I (I vs. III, 15.12±6.90 vs. 17.40±7.05, P=0.005). The rate of LN noncompliance decreased with phase advancement. Textbook outcome (TO) analysis showed that the learning phase was an independent factor in TO attainment (P<0.05). With learning phase advancement, the short-term outcomes were significantly improved. It is possible that our optimization of surgical procedures could have contributed to this improvement. The findings of this study facilitate the safe dissemination of RG in the minimally invasive era.",['Xue Z; Lu J; Lin J; Xu KX; Xu BB; Wu D; Zheng HL; Xie JW; Wang JB; Lin JX; Chen QY; Li P; Huang CM; Zheng CH'],2024,study aims to establish a learning curve for radical robotic gastrectomy. study aims to evaluate its effect on short-term outcomes of patients with gastric cancer.
Electrochemical Sensor for the Detection and Accurate Early Diagnosis of Ovarian Cancer.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality rate among malignant tumors, primarily because it is difficult to diagnose early. Exosomes, a type of extracellular vesicle rich in parental information, have garnered significant attention in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment. They play an important regulatory role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of OC. Consequently, exosomes have emerged as noninvasive biomarkers for early cancer detection. Therefore, identifying cancer-derived exosomes may offer a novel biomarker for the early detection of OC. In this study, we developed a metal-organic frameworks assembled ""double hook""-type aptamer electrochemical sensor, which enables accurate early diagnosis of OC. Under optimal experimental conditions, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technology demonstrated a good linear relationship within the concentration range of 31-3.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> particles per microliter, with a detection limit as low as 12 particles per microliter. The universal exosome detection platform is constructed, and this platform can not only differentiate between high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients and healthy individuals but also distinguish between HGSOC patients and nonhigh-grade serous OC (non-HGSOC). Consequently, it provides a novel strategy for the early diagnosis of OC and holds great significance in clinical differential diagnosis.",['Ge F; Ding W; Han C; Zhang L; Liu Q; Zhao J; Luo Z; Jia C; Qu P; Zhang L'],2024,"exosomes have emerged as noninvasive biomarkers for early detection. they are a type of extracellular vesicle rich in parental information. they play an important regulatory role in the occurrence, development, and metastasis of OC."
Serum cytokines and creatinine/cystatin C ratio as prognostic biomarkers in advanced cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), specifically targeting the programmed cell death protein-1 or its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1), have been extensively used in the treatment of a spectrum of malignancies, although the predictive biomarkers remain to be elucidated. This study aims to investigate the association between baseline circulating levels of cytokines and the creatinine/cystatin C ratio (CCR) with the treatment outcomes of ICIs in patients with advanced cancer. The pre-treatment circulating levels of 10 cytokines (PD-L1, CTLA4, CXCL10, LAG3, HGF, CCL2, MIG, GRANB, IL-18, and IL-6) were measured via automated capillary-based immunoassay platform in the serum of 65 advanced cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1-based systemic therapy and 10 healthy volunteers. The levels of cytokines and CCR were quantified and categorized into high and low groups based on the median value. The associations of serum cytokines and CCR with response to treatment, survival, and immune-related adverse events were assessed. Elevated circulating levels of 6 cytokines (PD-L1, CXCL10, HGF, CCL2, MIG, and IL-6) were observed in cancer patients compared with that in healthy volunteers. The correlation coefficients between cytokines, CCR and nutritional risk index were also calculated. In the cancer cohort (N = 65), low circulating HGF (P = 0.023, P = 0.029), low IL-6 (P = 0.002, P < 0.001), and high CCR (P = 0.031, P = 0.008) were associated with significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Multi-variable COX analyses adjusted for clinicopathological factors revealed that low HGF, low IL-6, and high CCR were independent favorable prognostic factors for PFS (P = 0.028, P = 0.010, and P = 0.015, respectively) and OS (P = 0.043, P = 0.003, and P = 0.026, respectively). Grade 2 irAEs occurred more frequently in patients with low levels of circulating CCL2 and LAG3. Pre-treatment circulating levels of serum IL-6, HGF, and CCR may serve as independent predictive and prognostic biomarkers in advanced cancer patients treated with ICIs-based systemic therapy. These findings might help to identify potential patients who would benefit from these therapies.",['Jin SX; Liu BN; Ji HJ; Wu JR; Li BL; Gao XL; Li N; Zheng ZD; Du C'],2024,ICIs targeting the programmed cell death protein-1 or its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) have been extensively used in the treatment of a spectrum of malignancies. the predictive biomarkers remain to be elucidated.
Clonal hematopoiesis and bone marrow infiltration in patients with follicular helper T-cell lymphoma of angioimmunoblastic type.,"Follicular helper T-cell (TFH) lymphoma harbors recurrent mutations of RHOA<sup>G17V</sup>, IDH2<sup>R172</sup>, TET2 and DNMT3A. TET2 and DNMT3A mutations are the most frequently affected genes in clonal hematopoiesis (CH). The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency of CH in bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of TFH/angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (TFH-AITL) patients and its association with myeloid neoplasms. A total of 29 BMB from 22 patients with a diagnosis of TFH-AITL were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a custom panel. Morphologically, 5 BMB revealed TFH-AITL infiltrates of >5% of BM cellularity confirmed in 4 cases by NGS-based T-cell clonality. IDH2<sup>R172</sup> was demonstrated only in 1/29 (3%), and RHOA<sup>G17V</sup> in 2/29 (7%) samples. TET2 and DNMT3A were identified in 24/29 (83%) and17/29 (59%) BMB, respectively. In the parallel lymph node (LN) the frequencies of mutations were 27% (IDH2<sup>R172</sup>), 64% (RHOA<sup>G17V</sup>), 86% (TET2), and 50% (DNMT3A). TET2 and/or DNMT3A mutations identical in LN and BMB were present in 18/22 (82%) patients, regardless of BM infiltration. In 3 cases the CH mutations were detected 13, 41, and 145 months before TFH-AITL diagnosis. Cases with TET2/DNMT3A mutations and BM variant allele frequencies (VAF) >40% (7/18, 39%) showed lower blood counts. However, only low platelet count was statistically significant (p = 0.024). Myeloid neoplasms and/or MDS-related mutations were identified in 4 cases (4/22; 18%); all with high TET2 VAFs (>40%; p = 0.0114). In conclusion, CH is present in 82% of TFH-AITL and can be demonstrated up to 145 months before TFH-AITL diagnosis. NGS T-cell clonality analysis is an excellent tool to confirm TFH-AITL BM infiltration. Concurrent myeloid neoplasms were identified in 18% of the cases and were associated with TET2 mutations with high allelic burden (>40%). We demonstrate that myeloid neoplasms might occur simultaneously or precede the diagnosis of TFH lymphoma.",['Harland L; Borgmann V; Otto F; Overkamp M; Bonzheim I; Fend F; Quintanilla-Martinez L; Nann D'],2024,"TFH lymphoma harbors recurrent mutations of RHOAsup>G17V/sup>, IDH2sup>R172/sup>, TET2 and DNMT3A. a total of 29 BMB from 22 patients with a diagnosis of TFH-AITL were analyzed by next-generation sequencing."
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on type 2 diabetes care and factors associated with care disruption in Kenya and Tanzania.,"The COVID-19 pandemic affected healthcare delivery globally, impacting care access and delivery of essential services. We investigated the pandemic's impact on care for patients with type 2 diabetes and factors associated with care disruption in Kenya and Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults diagnosed with diabetes pre-COVID-19. Data were collected in February-April 2022 reflecting experiences at two time-points, three months before and the three months most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire captured data on blood glucose testing, changes in medication prescription and access, and healthcare provider access. We recruited 1000 participants (500/country). Diabetes care was disrupted in both countries, with 34.8% and 32.8% of the participants reporting change in place and frequency of testing in Kenya, respectively. In Tanzania, 12.4% and 17.8% reported changes in location and frequency of glucose testing, respectively. The number of health facility visits declined, 14.4% (<i>p</i> < 0.001) in Kenya and 5.6% (<i>p</i> = 0.001) in Tanzania. In Kenya, there was a higher likelihood of severe care disruption among insured patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI][1.05-2.34]; <i>p</i> = 0.029) and a lower likelihood among patients residing in rural areas (aOR, 0.35[95%CI, 0.22-0.58]; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Tanzania had a lower likelihood of severe disruption among insured patients (aOR, 0.51[95%CI, 0.33-0.79]; <i>p</i> = 0.003) but higher likelihood among patients with low economic status (aOR, 1.81[95%CI, 1.14-2.88]; <i>p</i> = 0.011).

"The Effects of a Red-Light Controllable Nitric Oxide Donor, NORD-1, on Erectile Dysfunction in Rats with Streptozotocin Induced Diabetes Mellitus.","Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) often exhibit refractory erectile dysfunction (ED). Red-light-controllable nitric oxide donor (NORD-1) and red-light irradiation have successfully enhanced erectile function in intact rats. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of NORD-1 and red-light irradiation effectively treated ED in streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats with DM. Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. Rats in the DM and sham groups received intravenous STZ (50 mg/kg) and saline, respectively. One week after treatment, the blood glucose level of rats in the DM group was >250 mg/dL. Five weeks after the treatment, we performed a functional study by measuring intracavernous pressure (ICP) under cavernous nerve stimulation before and after NORD-1 treatment with and without light irradiation. Additionally, we performed an isometric tension study using the corpus cavernosum of rats treated with NORD-1 or the control compound, SiR650. The ICP/mean arterial pressure (MAP) ratio was significantly lower in the DM group than in the sham group before and after NORD-1 treatment without light irradiation (both p<0.05). After NORD-1 treatment with light irradiation, the ICP/MAP ratio in the sham and DM groups was significantly enhanced than before and after NORD-1 treatment without light irradiation (all p<0.05). The ICP/MAP ratio in the DM group after NORD-1 with light irradiation was similar to that in the sham group under normal conditions before NORD-1 treatment. Moreover, the systemic blood pressure was not affected by NORD-1 or light irradiation. In the tension study, the corpus cavernosum of rats treated with SiR650 was not changed by red light in the sham or DM groups. However, the rats treated with NORD-1 were strongly relaxed by red light in both groups. NORD-1 and red-light irradiation could improve ED in the presence of DM without lowering blood pressure.",['Hotta Y; Oyama K; Yoshida T; Ieda N; Mori T; Horita Y; Kataoka T; Furukawa-Hibi Y; Ohya S; Nakagawa H; Kimura K'],2024,"red-light-controllable nitric oxide donor (NORD-1) and red-light irradiation have successfully enhanced erectile function in intact rats. rats in the DM and sham groups received intravenous STZ (50 mg/kg) and saline, respectively."
Effect of Race and Insurance Status on Treatment and Outcomes in Diabetic Retinopathy: Analysis of 43 274 Eyes Using the IRIS Registry.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To examine disparities in visual acuity (VA) outcomes 1 year and 2 years after initiation of diabetic retinopathy (DR) or diabetic macular edema (DME) treatment in patients based on race/ethnicity and insurance status, accounting for disease severity. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective analysis used the IRIS Registry and included DR patients older than 18 years with documented antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment and VA data for at least 2 years. International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to determine the severity of DR and DME presence. VA outcomes were assessed using multivariable linear regressions and anti-VEGF drug use by multivariable logistic regressions, with race and insurance status as independent variables. Main outcome measures comprised the mean VA change at 1 year and 2 years and percentage of patients treated with bevacizumab. <b>Results:</b> The study included 43 274 eyes. White patients presented with a higher mean VA and lower mean DR severity than Black patients and Hispanic patients. Multivariable logistic regression showed Hispanic patients were significantly more likely to be treated with bevacizumab than White patients across all insurance types, controlling for disease severity and VA. After 1 year, the letter improvement was 1.73, 1.33, and 1.13 in White patients, Black patients, and Hispanic patients, respectively. Multivariable linear regression suggested that across races, Medicaid-insured patients had significantly smaller gains in VA than privately insured patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> Race-based and insurance-based differences in 1-year and 2-year outcomes after anti-VEGF treatment for DR and anti-VEGF treatment patterns suggest a need to ensure earlier and more effective treatment of minority and underserved patients in the United States.",['Maturi J; Maturi V; Scott AW; Carson KA; Ciulla T; Maturi R'],2024,DR patients over 18 years with documented anti-VEGF treatment.

ChIP-seq and RNA-seq Reveal the Involvement of Histone Lactylation Modification in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Lactylation is a novel post-translational modification of proteins. Although the histone lactylation modification has been reported to be involved in glucose metabolism, its role and molecular pathways in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are still unclear. This study aims to elucidate the histone lactylation modification landscapes of GDM patients and explore lactylation-modification-related genes involved in GDM. We employed a combination of RNA-seq analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis to identify upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with hyperhistone lactylation modification in GDM. We demonstrated that the levels of lactate and histone lactylation were significantly elevated in GDM patients. DEGs were involved in diabetes-related pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway. ChIP-seq analysis indicated that histone lactylation modification in the promoter regions of the GDM group was significantly changed. By integrating the results of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis, we found that CACNA2D1 is a key gene for histone lactylation modification and is involved in the progression of GDM by promoting cell vitality and proliferation. In conclusion, we identified the key gene CACNA2D1, which upregulated and exhibited hypermodification of histone lactylation in GDM. These findings establish a theoretical groundwork for the targeted therapy of GDM.",['Huang X; Yip K; Nie H; Chen R; Wang X; Wang Y; Lin W; Li R'],2024,lactylation is a novel post-translational modification of proteins. it has been reported to be involved in glucose metabolism. but its role and molecular pathways in gestational diabetes mellitus are still unclear.
Pre-operative lung ablation prediction using deep learning.,"Microwave lung ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive and inexpensive alternative cancer treatment for patients who are not candidates for surgery/radiotherapy. However, a major challenge for MWA is its relatively high tumor recurrence rates, due to incomplete treatment as a result of inaccurate planning. We introduce a patient-specific, deep-learning model to accurately predict post-treatment ablation zones to aid planning and enable effective treatments. Our IRB-approved retrospective study consisted of ablations with a single applicator/burn/vendor between 01/2015 and 01/2019. The input data included pre-procedure computerized tomography (CT), ablation power/time, and applicator position. The ground truth ablation zone was segmented from follow-up CT post-treatment. Novel deformable image registration optimized for ablation scans and an applicator-centric co-ordinate system for data analysis were applied. Our prediction model was based on the U-net architecture. The registrations were evaluated using target registration error (TRE) and predictions using Bland-Altman plots, Dice co-efficient, precision, and recall, compared against the applicator vendor's estimates. The data included 113 unique ablations from 72 patients (median age 57, interquartile range (IQR) (49-67); 41 women). We obtained a TRE ≤ 2 mm on 52 ablations. Our prediction had no bias from ground truth ablation volumes (p = 0.169) unlike the vendor's estimate (p < 0.001) and had smaller limits of agreement (p < 0.001). An 11% improvement was achieved in the Dice score. The ability to account for patient-specific in-vivo anatomical effects due to vessels, chest wall, heart, lung boundaries, and fissures was shown. We demonstrated a patient-specific deep-learning model to predict the ablation treatment effect prior to the procedure, with the potential for improved planning, achieving complete treatments, and reduce tumor recurrence. Our method addresses the current lack of reliable tools to estimate ablation extents, required for ensuring successful ablation treatments. The potential clinical implications include improved treatment planning, ensuring complete treatments, and reducing tumor recurrence.",['Keshavamurthy KN; Eickhoff C; Ziv E'],2024,"microwave lung ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive alternative cancer treatment. but a major challenge for MWA is its relatively high tumor recurrence rates. we introduce a patient-specific, deep-learning model to accurately predict post-treatment ablation zones."
ESR Essentials: using the right scoring system in prostate MRI-practice recommendations by ESUR.,"MRI has gained prominence in the diagnostic workup of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) being widely used for cancer detection. Beyond PI-RADS, other MRI-based scoring tools have emerged to address broader aspects within the PCa domain. However, the multitude of available MRI-based grading systems has led to inconsistencies in their application within clinical workflows. The Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) assesses the likelihood of clinically significant radiological changes of PCa during active surveillance, and the Prostate Imaging for Local Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) scoring system evaluates the risk of local recurrence after whole-gland therapies with curative intent. Underlying any system is the requirement to assess image quality using the Prostate Imaging Quality Scoring System (PI-QUAL). This article offers practicing radiologists a comprehensive overview of currently available scoring systems with clinical evidence supporting their use for managing PCa patients to enhance consistency in interpretation and facilitate effective communication with referring clinicians. KEY POINTS: Assessing image quality is essential for all prostate MRI interpretations and the PI-QUAL score represents  the standardized tool for this purpose. Current urological clinical guidelines for prostate cancer diagnosis and localization recommend adhering to the PI-RADS recommendations. The PRECISE and PI-RR scoring systems can be used for assessing radiological changes of prostate cancer during active surveillance and the likelihood of local recurrence after radical treatments respectively.",['Ponsiglione A; Brembilla G; Cuocolo R; Gutierrez P; Moreira AS; Pecoraro M; Zawaideh J; Barentsz J; Giganti F; Padhani AR; Panebianco V; Puech P; Villeirs G'],2024,MRI has gained prominence in the diagnostic workup of prostate cancer patients. the PI-RADS scoring system is widely used for cancer detection. the PI-RR scoring system is used to assess image quality.
Challenges and pitfalls of youth-onset type 2 diabetes.,"The incidence and prevalence of youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing. The rise in frequency and severity of childhood obesity, inclination to sedentary lifestyle, and epigenetic risks related to prenatal hyperglycemia exposure are important drivers of the youth-onset T2DM epidemic and might as well be responsible for the early onset of diabetes complications. Indeed, youth-onset T2DM has a more extreme metabolic phenotype than adult-onset T2DM, with greater insulin resistance and more rapid deterioration of beta cell function. Therefore, intermediate complications such as microalbuminuria develop in late childhood or early adulthood, while end-stage complications develop in mid-life. Due to the lack of efficacy and safety data, several drugs available for the treatment of adults with T2DM have not been approved in youth, reducing the pharmacological treatment options. In this mini review, we will try to address the present challenges and pitfalls related to youth-onset T2DM and summarize the available interventions to mitigate the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.",['La Grasta Sabolic L; Marusic S; Cigrovski Berkovic M'],2024,"youth-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing. the rise in frequency and severity of childhood obesity, inclination to sedentary lifestyle, and epigenetic risks are important drivers of the youth-onset T2DM epidemic."
Dendritic Cell Immune Modulation <i>via</i> Polyphenol Membrane Coatings.,"Cellular hitchhiking is an emerging strategy for the <i>in vivo</i> control of adoptively transferred immune cells. Hitchhiking approaches are primarily mediated by adhesion of nano and microparticles to the cell membrane, which conveys an ability to modulate transferred cells <i>via</i> local drug delivery. Although T cell therapies employing this strategy have progressed into the clinic, phagocytic cells including dendritic cells (DCs) are much more challenging to engineer. DC vaccines hold great potential for a spectrum of diseases, and the combination drug delivery is an attractive strategy to manipulate their function and overcome <i>in vivo</i> plasticity. However, DCs are not compatible with current hitchhiking approaches due to their broad phagocytic capacity. In this work, we developed and validated META (membrane engineering using tannic acid) to enable DC cellular hitchhiking for the first time. META employs the polyphenol tannic acid (TA) to facilitate supramolecular assembly of protein drug cargoes on the cell membrane, enabling the creation of cell surface-bound formulations for local drug delivery to carrier DCs. We optimized META formulations to incorporate and release protein cargoes with varying physical properties alone and in combination and to preserve DC viability and critical functions such as migration. We further show that META loaded with either a pro- or anti-inflammatory cargo can influence the carrier cell phenotype, thus demonstrating the flexibility of the approach for applications from cancer to autoimmune disease. Overall, this approach illustrates a new platform for the local control of phagocytic immune cells as a next step to advance DC therapies in the clinic.",['Janes ME; Park KS; Gottlieb AP; Curreri A; Adebowale K; Kim J; Mitragotri S'],2024,cellular hitchhiking is an emerging strategy for the i>in vivo/i> control of adoptively transferred immune cells. phagocytic cells including dendritic cells (DCs) are more challenging to engineer.
Regional Disparities in Prehospital Delay of Acute Ischemic Stroke: The Korean Stroke Registry.,"Late hospital arrival keeps patients with stroke from receiving recanalization therapy and is associated with poor outcomes. This study used a nationwide acute stroke registry to investigate the trends and regional disparities in prehospital delay and analyze the significant factors associated with late arrivals. Patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack between January 2012 and December 2021 were included. The prehospital delay was identified, and its regional disparity was evaluated using the Gini coefficient for nine administrative regions. Multivariate models were used to identify factors significantly associated with prehospital delays of >4.5 h. A total of 144,014 patients from 61 hospitals were included. The median prehospital delay was 460 min (interquartile range, 116-1912), and only 36.8% of patients arrived at hospitals within 4.5 h. Long prehospital delays and high regional inequality (Gini coefficient > 0.3) persisted throughout the observation period.

Enhancing clinical utility: deep learning-based embryo scoring model for non-invasive aneuploidy prediction.,"The best method for selecting embryos ploidy is preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A). However, it takes more labour, money, and experience. As such, more approachable, non- invasive techniques were still needed. Analyses driven by artificial intelligence have been presented recently to automate and objectify picture assessments. In present retrospective study, a total of 3448 biopsied blastocysts from 979 Time-lapse (TL)-PGT cycles were retrospectively analyzed. The ""intelligent data analysis (iDA) Score"" as a deep learning algorithm was used in TL incubators and assigned each blastocyst with a score between 1.0 and 9.9. Significant differences were observed in iDAScore among blastocysts with different ploidy. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher scores were significantly correlated with euploidy (p < 0.001). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of iDAScore alone for predicting euploidy embryo is 0.612, but rose to 0.688 by adding clinical and embryonic characteristics. This study provided additional information to strengthen the clinical applicability of iDAScore. This may provide a non-invasive and inexpensive alternative for patients who have no available blastocyst for biopsy or who are economically disadvantaged. However, the accuracy of embryo ploidy is still dependent on the results of next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) analysis.",['Ma BX; Zhao GN; Yi ZF; Yang YL; Jin L; Huang B'],2024,"a total of 3448 biopsied blastocysts from 979 Time-lapse cycles were retrospectively analyzed. the ""intelligent data analysis (iDA) Score"" was used in TL incubators."
RedCDR: Dual Relation Distillation for Cancer Drug Response Prediction.,"Based on multi-omics data and drug information, predicting the response of cancer cell lines to drugs is a crucial area of research in modern oncology, as it can promote the development of personalized treatments. Despite the promising performance achieved by existing models, most of them overlook the variations among different omics and lack effective integration of multi-omics data. Moreover, the explicit modeling of cell line/drug attribute and cell line-drug association has not been thoroughly investigated in existing approaches. To address these issues, we propose RedCDR, a dual relation distillation model for cancer drug response (CDR) prediction. Specifically, a parallel dual-branch architecture is designed to enable both the independent learning and interactive fusion feasible for cell line/drug attribute and cell line-drug association information. To facilitate the adaptive interacting integration of multi-omics data, the proposed multi-omics encoder introduces the multiple similarity relations between cell lines and takes the importance of different omics data into account. To accomplish knowledge transfer from the two independent attribute and association branches to their fusion, a dual relation distillation mechanism consisting of representation distillation and prediction distillation is presented. Experiments conducted on the GDSC and CCLE datasets show that RedCDR outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in CDR prediction. The source code is available at https://github.com/mhxu1998/RedCDR.",['Xu M; Zhu Z; Zhao Y; He K; Huang Q; Zhao Y'],2024,a dual relation distillation model for cancer drug response (CDR) prediction is proposed. the proposed multi-omics encoder introduces multiple similarity relations between cell lines.
PDLIM1 Inhibits Chemoresistance by Blocking DNA Damage Repair in Gastric Cancer.,"Current cisplatin (CDDP) resistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. To address the issue of drug resistance, we explored the regulatory functions of PDZ and LIM structural domain protein 1 (PDLIM1) in CDDP chemotherapy for gastric cancer. In this study, we analyzed PDLIM1 expression and prognosis using bioinformatics on publicly available data. PDLIM1 expression in a gastric mucosal epithelial cell line (GSE-1), CDDP- sensitive (SGC7901, BGC823) and CDDP-resistant gastric cancer cells was detected by RTqPCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferative capacity was assessed by knockdown of PDLIM1 and overexpression of PDLIM1 in cells administered in combination with cisplatin, and apoptotic levels were measured by CCK-8 and colony formation assay and by flow cytometry. Expression of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and γH2AX was determined by Western blotting or immunofluorescence staining. Downregulation of PDLIM1 was found in tumor tissues and cells, which was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Knockdown of PDLIM1 enhanced proliferation and attenuated apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. In addition, the therapeutic effects of CDDP on proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair were attenuated by PDLIM1 deletion.PDLIM1 expression was downregulated in CDDP-resistant tumor cells. Overexpression of PDLIM1 overcomes CDDP resistance in tumor cells as BRCA1 expression decreases and γH2AX expression increases. Our findings demonstrate that PDLIM1 enables to alleviate gastric cancer progression and resistance to cisplatin via impeding DNA damage repair.",['Chen Y; Yang X; Li Q'],2024,PDZ and LIM structural domain protein 1 (PDLIM1) were regulatory functions in CDDP chemotherapy for gastric cancer.

Effect of Akkermansia muciniphila on pancreatic islet β-cell function in rats with prediabetes mellitus induced by a high-fat diet.,"Prediabetes is an important stage in the development of diabetes. It is necessary to find a safe, effective and sustainable way to delay and reverse the progression of prediabetes. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) is one of the key bacteria associated with glucose metabolism. Recent studies mainly focus on the effect of A. muciniphila on obesity and insulin resistance, but there is no research on the effect of A. muciniphila on pancreatic β-cell function and its mechanism in prediabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of A. muciniphila on β-cell function, apoptosis and differentiation, as well as its effects on the gut microbiome, intestinal barrier, metaflammation and the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetic rat model. The effect of A. muciniphila was compared with dietary intervention. The results showed both A. muciniphila treatment and dietary intervention can reduce metaflammation by repairing the intestinal barrier in rats with prediabetes induced by an HFD and improve β-cell secretory function, apoptosis and differentiation through signaling pathways mediated by TLR2 and TLR4. Additionally, A. muciniphila can further elevate β-cell secretion, attenuate apoptosis and improve differentiation and the TLR signaling pathway on the basis of diet.",['Yan S; Chen L; Li N; Wei X; Wang J; Dong W; Wang Y; Shi J; Ding X; Peng Y'],2024,"prediabetes is an important stage in the development of diabetes. it is necessary to find a safe, effective and sustainable way to delay and reverse the progression of prediabetes."
Metabolic profiling reveals the nutraceutical effect of Gongolaria abies-marina and Rosmarinus officinalis extracts in a type 1 diabetes animal model.,"Nutraceuticals have gained increasing interest, prompting the need to investigate plant extracts for their beneficial properties and potential side effects. This study aimed to assess the nutraceutical effects of environmentally clean extracts from Rosmarinus officinalis and Gongolaria abies-marina (formerly Cystoseira abies-marina (Phaeophyceae)) on the metabolic profile of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We conducted untargeted LC-QTOF-MS metabolic profiling on six groups of rats: three diabetic groups receiving either a placebo, R. officinalis, or G. abies-marina extracts, and three corresponding control groups. The metabolic analysis revealed significant alterations in the levels of various glycerophospholipids, sterol lipids, and fatty acyls. Both extracts influenced the metabolic profile, partially mitigating diabetes-induced changes. Notably, G. abies-marina extract had a more pronounced impact on the animals' metabolic profiles compared to R. officinalis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that environmentally clean extracts from R. officinalis and G. abies-marina possess nutraceutical potential, as they were able to modulate the metabolic profile in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. G. abies-marina extract exhibited a more substantial effect on metabolic alterations induced by diabetes compared to R. officinalis. These results warrant further exploration of these plant extracts for their potential in managing diabetes-related metabolic disturbances.",['Godzien J; Jablonowski K; Ruperez FJ; Kretowski A; Ciborowski M; Kalaska B'],2024,a study aimed to assess the nutraceutical effects of environmentally clean extracts from a group of rats. the results suggest that environmentally clean extracts from a group of rats have nutraceutical potential.
Replication stress as a driver of cellular senescence and aging.,"Replication stress refers to slowing or stalling of replication fork progression during DNA synthesis that disrupts faithful copying of the genome. While long considered a nexus for DNA damage, the role of replication stress in aging is under-appreciated. The consequential role of replication stress in promotion of organismal aging phenotypes is evidenced by an extensive list of hereditary accelerated aging disorders marked by molecular defects in factors that promote replication fork progression and operate uniquely in the replication stress response. Additionally, recent studies have revealed cellular pathways and phenotypes elicited by replication stress that align with designated hallmarks of aging. Here we review recent advances demonstrating the role of replication stress as an ultimate driver of cellular senescence and aging. We discuss clinical implications of the intriguing links between cellular senescence and aging including application of senotherapeutic approaches in the context of replication stress.",['Herr LM; Schaffer ED; Fuchs KF; Datta A; Brosh RM'],2024,replication stress is a key driver of cellular senescence and aging. it refers to slowing or stalling of replication fork progression during DNA synthesis. this is a nexus for DNA damage but the role of replication stress in aging is under-appreciated.
Survival and Toxicity in Patients With Unresectable or Inoperable Biliary Tract Cancers With Ablative Radiation Therapy Versus Nonablative Chemoradiation.,"Conventional chemoradiation (CCRT) is inadequately effective for the treatment of unresectable or inoperable biliary tract cancers (UIBC). Ablative radiation therapy (AR), typically defined as a biologically effective dose (BED) ≥80.5 Gy, has shown some promise in terms of local control and survival in these patients. We compare the efficacy and toxicity of AR to non-AR in UIBC patients. Patients with UIBC treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT; n = 18) or CCRT (n = 28) between 2006 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The associations of treatment, BED groups, selected characteristics with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and local control were estimated separately using Cox proportional hazards regression. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Median dose fractionation was 60 Gy in 5 fractions (median BED, 127 Gy) for SBRT and 50 Gy in 25 fractions (median BED, 64 Gy) for CCRT. The median follow-up of the entire cohort was 11.5 months. The 1-year OS rate was 62% for BED <80.5 versus 66% for BED ≥80.5 (<i>P</i> = .069). The 1-year PFS rate was 24% for BED <80.5 and 29% for BED ≥80.5 (<i>P</i> = .050). The 1-year local control rate was 20% for BED <80.5 and 41% for BED ≥80.5 (<i>P</i> = .097). BED as a continuous variable (<i>P</i> = .013), BED ≥100 Gy (<i>P</i> = .044), and race (white versus nonwhite) (<i>P</i> = .037) were associated with improved overall mortality. BED ≥80.5 Gy (<i>P</i> = .046), smaller tumor size (<5 cm; <i>P</i> = .038) and N0 disease (<i>P</i> <.0001) were associated with improved disease progression rates. Local control was improved in patients with N0 disease compared with N1 disease (<i>P</i> <.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated; there was no difference in acute and late toxicity between AR and non-AR. In this review, there was improved PFS with BED ≥80.5 Gy with a trend toward OS benefit. BED ≥80.5 Gy was achieved mostly through SBRT and was well tolerated. AR could be considered a more effective treatment modality than CCRT in patients with UIBC.",['Yankey H; Ruth KJ; Dotan E; Reddy S; Meyer JE'],2024,CCRT is inadequately effective for treatment of unresectable or inoperable biliary tract cancers. compared efficacy and toxicity of AR to non-AR in UIBC patients.
LC3A-mediated autophagy elicits PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 axis activation and mitochondrial dysfunction: Exposing vulnerability in aggresome positive cancer cells.,"The unfolded protein response pathways (UPR), autophagy, and compartmentalization of misfolded proteins into inclusion bodies are critical components of the protein quality control network. Among inclusion bodies, aggresomes are particularly intriguing due to their association with cellular survival, drug resistance, and cancer-aggressive behavior. Aggresomes are molecular condensates formed when collapsed vimentin cages encircle misfolded proteins before final removal by autophagy. Yet significant gaps persist in the mechanisms governing aggresome formation and elimination in cancer cells. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial, especially considering the involvement of LC3A, a member of the MAP1LC3 family, which plays a unique role in autophagy regulation and has been reported to be epigenetically silenced in many cancers. Herein, we utilized tetracycline-inducible expression of LC3A to investigate its role in choroid plexus carcinoma cells, which inherently exhibit the presence of aggresomes. Live cell imaging was employed to demonstrate the effect of LC3A expression on aggresome-positive cells, while SILAC-based proteomics identified LC3A-induced protein and pathway alterations. Our findings demonstrate that extended expression of LC3A is associated with cellular senescence. However, the obstruction of lysosomal degradation in this context has a deleterious effect on cellular viability. In response to LC3A-induced autophagy, we observed significant alterations in mitochondrial morphology, reflected by mitochondrial dysfunction and increased ROS production. Furthermore, LC3A expression elicited the activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 axis of the UPR, underscoring a significant change in protein quality control network. In conclusion, our results elucidate that LC3A-mediated autophagy alters the protein quality control network, exposing a vulnerability in aggresome-positive cancer cells.",['Amer N; Hesham D; Al-Shehaby N; Elshoky HA; Amer M; Magdeldin S; Mansour M; Abou-Aisha K; El-Naggar S'],2024,LC3A plays a unique role in autophagy regulation and has been reported to be epigenetically silenced in many cancers. tetracycline-inducible expression of LC3A is associated with cellular senescence.

Preoperative cancer antigen-125 levels as a predictor of recurrence in early-stage endometrial cancer.,"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in developed countries, with a majority of cases being low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer. Identifying risk factors for disease recurrence and poor prognosis is critical. This study aimed to assess the correlation between preoperative cancer antigen-125 levels and disease recurrence in early-stage endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. The study was a retrospective analysis of 217 patients diagnosed with endometrioid endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital between 2016 and 2022. Patients were divided into two groups based on their preoperative cancer antigen-125 levels and compared with clinicopathological findings and disease recurrence. Disease-free survival rates were calculated, and logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent factors affecting disease-free survival. The mean age of patients was 61.59±0.75 years, and the mean follow-up time was 36.95±1.18 months. The mean cancer antigen-125 level was 27.80±37.81 IU/mL. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group with elevated cancer antigen-125 levels (p=0.025). Disease-free survival was lower in patients with elevated cancer antigen-125 compared with those with normal levels (p=0.005). Logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated cancer antigen-125 levels were associated with disease recurrence (OR: 3.43, 95%CI 1.13-10.37, p=0.029). The findings of this study suggest that preoperative cancer antigen-125 levels can be used as a predictor of disease recurrence in early-stage endometrioid endometrial cancer patients. cancer antigen-125 levels may be a useful tool for risk stratification and patient management in endometrial cancer.",['Erturk A; Korkmaz E; Arslantas Z; Bekdemir S; Erturk NK'],2024,endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in developed countries. a majority of cases are low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer. a retrospective analysis of 217 patients diagnosed with endometrioid endometrial cancer between 2016 and 2022.
Racial and ethnic differences in epithelial ovarian cancer risk: an analysis from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium.,"Limited estimates exist on risk factors for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Asian, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (NHPI) women. Participants included 1734 Asian (785 cases, 949 controls), 266 NHPI (99 cases, 167 controls), 1149 Hispanic (505 cases, 644 controls), and 24,189 White (9,981 cases, 14,208 controls) women from 11 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk associations by race and ethnicity. Heterogeneity in EOC risk associations by race and ethnicity (p ≤ 0.02) was observed for oral contraceptive (OC) use, parity, tubal ligation and smoking. We observed inverse associations with EOC risk for OC use and parity across all groups; associations were strongest in NHPI and Asian women. The inverse association for tubal ligation with risk was most pronounced for NHPI participants (OR=0.25, 95% CI 0.13-0.48), versus Asian and White participants, respectively (OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.90; OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.73-0.85).

Development and validation of a model for predicting upstage in minimally invasive lung adenocarcinoma in Chinese people.,"Sublobar resection for ground-glass opacity became a recommend surgery choice supported by the JCOG0804/JCOG0802/JCOG1211 results. Sublobar resection includes segmentectomy and wedge resection, wedge resection is suitable for non-invasive lesions, but in clinical practice, when pathologists are uncertain about the intraoperative frozen diagnosis of invasive lesions, difficulty in choosing the appropriate operation occurs. The purpose of this study was to analyze how to select invasive lesions with clinic-pathological characters. A retrospective study was conducted on 134 cases of pulmonary nodules diagnosed with minimally invasive adenocarcinoma by intraoperative freezing examination. The patients were divided into two groups according to intraoperative frozen results: the minimally invasive adenocarcinoma group and the at least minimally invasive adenocarcinoma group. A variety of clinical features were collected. Chi-square tests and multiple regression logistic analysis were used to screen out independent risk factors related to pathological upstage, and then ROC curves were established. In addition, an independent validation set included 1164 cases was collected. Independent risk factors related to pathological upstage were CT value, maximum tumor diameter, and frozen result of AL-MIA. The AUC of diagnostic mode was 71.1% [95%CI: 60.8-81.3%]. The independent validation included 1164 patients, 417 (35.8%) patients had paraffin-based pathology of invasive adenocarcinoma. The AUC of diagnostic mode was 75.7% [95%CI: 72.9-78.4%]. The intraoperative frozen diagnosis was AL-MIA, maximum tumor diameter larger than 15 mm and CT value is more than - 450Hu, highly suggesting that the lung GGO was invasive adenocarcinoma which represent a higher risk to recurrence.

"Prevalence of dyslipidemia, hypertension and diabetes among tribal and rural population in a south Indian forested region.","While NCDs are in rise globally, tribal and rural populations residing near to reserve forests with limited exposure to modern lifestyles may bear a unique burden. This study investigates the prevalence and risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among these communities. We conducted a cross-sectional study between 2018 and 2020 in the forest-dwelling population of Chamarajanagar, India. Using multistage stratified sampling based on caste and remoteness, we enrolled 608 participants aged over 18 years, including 259 non-tribal and 349 tribal individuals. Data collection includes the administration of STEPS questionnaire and measurement of fasting blood sugar, lipid levels, and blood pressure. The prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 4.6%, 28.8%, and 85.7%, respectively, among the study population. We also found abnormal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), Triglycerides (TGA), Total cholesterol (TC), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)in 4.9%, 82.4%, 22.7%, 5.8%, and 7.4% of participants, respectively. Significant differences were observed in diabetes, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, VLDL abnormality, and TC abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, or HDL abnormality, across the Socio Geographic Discrimination Index. We found a significant difference in diabetes and HDL abnormality, but not in hypertension, dyslipidemia, LDL abnormality, TGA abnormality, TC abnormality, or VLDL abnormality, between tribal and non-tribal populations living in the forest-dwelling area. Waist circumference was a significant independent predictor of diabetes among tribal participants, while wealth index, age, and waist circumference were significant predictors of hypertension. There were no significant predictors for dyslipidemia among tribal participants. Our study suggests that tribal population living in a remote area are at a lower risk of developing diabetes compared to non-tribal populations living in the same geographic area. However, the prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia among tribal populations remains high and comparable to that of the general population.",['Mallikarjuna Majgi S; Channa Basappa Y; Belagihalli Manjegowda S; Nageshappa S; Suresh H; Babu GR; Srinivas PN'],2024,"study enrolled 608 participants aged over 18 years. prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was 4.6%, 28.8%, and 85.7%."
"NKX2‑1 copy number alterations are associated with oncogenic, immunological and prognostic remodeling in non‑small cell lung cancer.","NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1) copy number alterations (CNAs) are frequently observed in lung cancer. However, little is known about the complete landscape of focal alterations in NKX2-1 copy number (CN), their clinical significance and their therapeutic implications in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The correlations between NKX2-1 expression and EGFR driver mutations and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) co-expression were studied using immunohistochemistry and PCR from the tumors of recruited Filipino patients (n=45). Clinical features of NSCLC with NKX2-1 CNAs were resolved at the tumor and clonal levels using the molecular profiles of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n=1,130), and deconvoluted single-cell RNA-seq data from the Bivona project (n=1,654), respectively. Despite a significant and positive correlation between expression and CN (r=0.264; P<0.001), NKX2-1 CNAs exerted a stronger influence on the combined EGFR and PD-L1 status of NSCLC tumors than expression. NKX2-1 CN gain was prognostic of favorable survival (P=0.018) and a better response to targeted therapy. NKX2-1 CN loss predicted a worse survival (P=0.041). Mutational architecture in the Y-chromosome differentiated the two prognostic groups. There were 19,941 synonymous mutations and 1,408 genome-wide CN perturbations associated with NKX2-1 CNAs. Tumors with NKX2-1 CN gain expressed lymphocyte markers more heterogeneously than those with CN loss. Higher expression of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte gene signatures in CN gain was prognostic of longer disease-free survival (P=0.005). Tumors with NKX2-1 CN gain had higher B-cell (P<0.001) and total T-cell estimates (P=0.003). NKX2-1 CN loss was associated with immunologically colder tumors due to higher M2 macrophage infiltrates (P=0.011) and higher expression of immune checkpoint proteins, CD274 (P=0.025), VTCN1 (P<0.001) and LGALS9 (P=0.002).

[Clinical effect of acupuncture combined with medication on diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its influence on serum lipid metabolism].,"To observe the clinical effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) treated with acupuncture combined with medication and explore its effect mechanism. Sixty-two patients of DPN were randomly divided into a combined therapy group (31 cases) and a medication group (31 cases, 2 cases dropped out); besides, 20 healthy subjects were recruited as a normal group. On the base of routine intervention, in the medication group, thioctic acid capsules were administrated orally, 0.2 g each time, 3 times a day. In the combined therapy group, besides the medication as the medication group, acupuncture was performed on bilateral Quchi (LI 11), Waiguan (TE 5), Hegu (LI 4), Tianshu (ST 25), Zusanli (ST 36), Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Taichong (LR 3) and the needles were retained for 30 min, acupuncture was delivered once daily, 6 times a week. The duration of treatment was 4 weeks in the two groups. The score of Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS), the nerve conduction velocity of median nerve (MN) and common peroneal nerve (CPN) were observed before and after treatment in the two intervention groups; and the serum lipid metabolism was detected before and after treatment in the two intervention groups and the normal group. Compared with that before treatment, the scores of TCSS were reduced in the combined therapy group and the medication group (<i>P</i><0.05) after treatment, and the score decrease in the combined therapy group was larger than that of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). The motor nerve conduction velocity and the sensory nerve conductive velocity of MN and CPN after treatment all increased in the combined therapy group and the medication group compared with those before treatment (<i>P</i><0.05), and the improvements in the combined therapy group were larger than those of the medication group (<i>P</i><0.001). Before treatment DPN patients had 365 differential lipid metabolites, including sphingosine (SPH, d18:0), involved in the inositol phosphate metabolism, compared with the subjects of the normal group. There were 103 differential lipid metabolites in the medication group before and after treatment, including lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LPE, 18:1/0:0), participated in glycerophospholipid metabolism.

The RhoA guanine exchange factor ABR: a glucose-sensitive mediator of actin reorganization in feto-placental arterial endothelial cells altered by gestational diabetes mellitus.,"In utero exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) programs the fetus, increasing offspring risk for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease later in life. Hyperglycaemia is widely recognized as the driving force of diabetes-induced programming. We have previously shown that GDM exposure alters DNA methylation and gene expression associated with actin remodelling in primary feto-placental arterial endothelial cells (fpEC). Thus, we hypothesized that hyperglycaemic insults underlie programmed changes in fpEC morphology and actin organization by GDM. Therefore, arterial fpECs isolated after normal and GDM pregnancy, as well as normal fpECs that were exposed to hyperglycaemia in vitro, were analysed for the effect of GDM and hyperglycaemia on actin organization and network formation. Integration of gene expression and DNA methylation data identified the RhoA activator active BCR-related (ABR) as programmed by GDM and altered by in vitro hyperglycaemia. ABR silencing in GDM-exposed cells reduced RhoA activity by 34 ± 26% (P = 0.033) and restored normal fpEC phenotype. In fact, in vitro hyperglycaemia induced a similar fpEC phenotype as intrauterine exposure to GDM, i.e. round morphology and increased network formation on Matrigel by 34 ± 33% (P = 0.022) vs. 22 ± 20% for GDM (P = 0.004). Thus, we identified ABR as a novel glucose sensitive regulator of actin organization and cell shape, programmed by GDM and upregulated by hyperglycaemia. Identification of mechanisms induced by hyperglycaemia and affecting endothelial function in the long term will contribute to understanding GDM-induced programming of offspring endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Future studies could focus on investigating the prevention or reversal of such malprogramming. KEY POINTS: In utero exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects future health of the offspring, with an increased risk for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in later life. GDM alters DNA methylation and expression of ABR in feto-placental arterial endothelial cells (fpEC), a model for endothelial cells exposed to the intrauterine environment of the fetus. GDM phenotype of fpECs is also induced by hyperglycaemia in vitro, and is characterized by altered actin organization and cell shape, which can be restored by ABR silencing. Revealing the cellular mechanisms induced by GDM and hyperglycaemia is important for understanding the mechanisms of how these conditions disturb endothelial function in the offspring.",['Tokic S; Novakovic B; Leopold-Posch B; Mühlberger M; Hoch D; Lögl J; Bernhart EM; Saffery R; Desoye G; Hiden U'],2024,hyperglycaemia is widely recognized as driving force of diabetes-induced programming. hyperglycaemia is widely recognized as driving force of diabetes-induced programming. hyperglycaemia is widely recognized as driving force of diabetes-induced programming.
"Coaches Activating, Reaching, and Engaging Patients to Engage in Advance Care Planning: A Randomized Clinical Trial.","Advance care planning (ACP) remains low among patients with advanced cancer. Multilevel interventions compared with clinician-level interventions may be more effective in improving ACP. To evaluate whether a multilevel intervention could improve clinician-documented ACP compared with a clinician-level intervention alone. This randomized clinical trial, performed from September 12, 2019, through May 12, 2021, included adults with advanced genitourinary cancers at an academic, tertiary hospital. Data analysis was performed by intention to treat from May 1 to August 10, 2023. Participants were randomized 1:1 to a 6-month patient-level lay health worker structured ACP education along with a clinician-level intervention composed of 3-hour ACP training and integration of a structured electronic health record documentation template (intervention group) or to the clinician-level intervention alone (control group). The primary outcome was ACP documentation in the electronic health record by the oncology clinician within 12 months after randomization. Secondary, exploratory outcomes included shared decision-making, palliative care use, hospice use, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations within 12 months after randomization. Among 402 participants enrolled in the study, median age was 71 years (range, 21-102 years); 361 (89.8%) identified as male. More intervention group participants had oncology clinician-documented ACP than control group participants (82 [37.8%] vs 40 [21.6%]; odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% CI, 1.44-3.64). At 12-month follow-up, more intervention than control group participants had palliative care (72 [33.2%] vs 25 [13.5%]; OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.91-5.28) and hospice use (49 [22.6%] vs 19 [10.3%]; OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.44-4.51). There were no differences in the proportion of participants between groups with an emergency department visit (65 [30.0%] vs 61 [33.0%]; OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.57-1.33) or hospitalization (89 [41.0%] vs 85 [46.0%]; OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55-1.22).

Effectiveness of a nurse-led management intervention on systolic blood pressure among type 2 diabetes patients in Uganda: a cluster randomized trial.,"Hypertension (HT) is an orchestrator of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in people living with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Control of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HT as a whole is suboptimal in diabetes, partly due to the scarcity of doctors. While nurse-led interventions are pragmatic and cost-effective in the control of HT in primary health care, their effectiveness on SBP control among patients with T2D in Uganda is scantly known. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nurse-led management intervention on SBP among T2D patients with a high ASCVD risk in Uganda. A two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial compared the nurse-led management intervention with usual doctor-led care. The intervention involved training nurses to provide structured health education, protocol-based HT/CVD management, 24-h phone calls, and 2-monthly text messages for 6 months. The primary outcome was the mean difference in SBP change among patients with T2D with a high ASCVD risk in the intervention and control groups after 6 months. The secondary outcome was the absolute difference in the number of patients at target for SBP, total cholesterol (TC), fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG), and body mass index (BMI) after the intervention. The study was analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess intra-cluster effect modifiers. Statistical significance was set at 0.05 for all analyses. Eight clinics (n = 388 patients) were included (intervention 4 clinics; n = 192; control 4 clinics; n = 196). A nurse-led intervention reduced SBP by -11.21 ± 16.02 mmHg with a mean difference between the groups of -13.75 mmHg (95% CI -16.48 to -11.02, p < 0.001). An increase in SBP of 2.54 ± 10.95 mmHg was observed in the control group. Diastolic blood pressure was reduced by -6.80 ± 9.48 mmHg with a mean difference between groups of -7.20 mmHg (95% C1 -8.87 to -5.48, p < 0.001). The mean differences in the change in ASCVD score and glycated hemoglobin were -4.73% (95% CI -5.95 to -3.51, p = 0.006) and -0.82% (95% CI -1.30 to -0.35, p = 0.001), respectively. There were significant absolute differences in the number of patients at target in SBP (p = 0.001), DBP (p = 0.003), and TC (p = 0.008).

Oral administration of CXCL12-expressing <i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> improves colitis by local immunomodulatory actions in preclinical models.,"Treatments of colitis, inflammation of the intestine, is today relying on induction of immune suppression associated with systemic adverse events including recurrent infections. This treatment strategy is specifically problematic in the increasing population of cancer patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced colitis, as immune suppression also interferes with the ICI-treatment response. Thus, there is a need for local-acting treatments which reduce inflammation and enhance intestinal healing. Here, we investigated the effect and safety of bacterial delivery of short-lived immunomodulating chemokines to the inflamed intestine in mice with colitis. Colitis was induced by DSS alone or in combination with ICI (anti-PD1, anti-CTLA-4) and <i>L. reuteri</i> R2LC genetically modified to express the chemokine CXCL12-1α (R2LC_CXCL12, emilimogene sigulactibac) was given perorally. In addition, pharmacology and safety of the formulated drug candidate, ILP100-Oral, was evaluated in rabbits. Peroral CXCL12-producing <i>L. reuteri</i> R2LC significantly improved colitis symptoms already after 2 days in mice with overt DSS and ICI-induced colitis, which in benchmarking experiments was demonstrated to be superior to treatments with anti-TNF-α, anti-α4ꞵ7 and corticosteroids. The mechanism of action involved chemokine delivery to Peyer´s Patches (PPs), confirmed by local CXCR4 signaling, and increased numbers of colonic, regulatory immune cells expressing IL-10 and TGF-β1. No systemic exposure or engraftment could be detected in mice, and product feasibility, pharmacology and safety were confirmed in rabbits. In conclusion, peroral CXCL12-producing <i>L. reuteri</i> R2LC efficiently ameliorates colitis and enhances mucosal healing, and has a favorable safety profile.",['Öhnstedt E; Doñas C; Parv K; Pang Y; Lofton Tomenius H; Carrasco López M; Gannavarapu VR; Choi J; Ovezik M; Frank P; Jorvid M; Roos S; Vågesjö E; Phillipson M'],2024,"colitis is induced by ICI-induced colitis, which is a common cause of inflammation. reuteri/i> R2LC was given perorally and improved colitis symptoms. chemokine delivery to peter saxosis was shown to be superior to anti-TNF-, anti-47 and corticosteroids."
Postoperative sarcopenia increases both gastric cancer and other-cause mortality in older adults undergoing radical gastrectomy for cancer.,"Preoperative sarcopenia in gastric cancer is associated with increased postoperative complications and reduced long-term survival. However, the association between postoperative sarcopenia and long-term outcomes remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the association between sarcopenia after gastrectomy for gastric cancer and survival outcomes. This retrospective study included 1512 patients aged ≥65 who underwent curative gastric resection for clinical stage I-III primary gastric cancer during 2008-2018. Sarcopenia was assessed preoperatively by measuring arm muscle area and grip strength, which was repeated 1 month after surgery. We compared the clinical characteristics, surgical treatments, and long-term outcomes between the postoperative normal and sarcopenia groups. Sarcopenia was observed in 173 and 305 patients pre- and postoperatively, respectively. Factors increasing the risk of postoperative sarcopenia included age of ≥75, lower preoperative body mass index, diabetes, and clinical stage II/III gastric cancer. Patients with postoperative sarcopenia after surgery had a significantly lower overall survival rate (hazard ratio [HR] 2.596, p < 0.001). Furthermore, postoperative sarcopenia was linked to decreased overall survival in patients with (HR 2.813, p = 0.002) and without (HR 1.925, p < 0.001) preoperative sarcopenia. Cumulative incidence showed significantly higher rates of deaths due to gastric cancer (HR 1.928, p < 0.001) and other causes (HR 2.736, p < 0.001) in the postoperative sarcopenia group. Postoperative sarcopenia in gastric cancer is linked to an increased risk of death due to cancer and other causes, underscoring the importance of perioperative sarcopenia management strategies.",['Fujiya K; Kodato T; Koseki Y; Furukawa K; Tanizawa Y; Terashima M; Bando E'],2024,"sarcopenia in gastric cancer is associated with increased postoperative complications. postoperative sarcopenia was linked to decreased overall survival in patients with (HR 2.813, p = 0.002) and without (HR 1.925, p  0.001) preoperative sarcopenia was linked to decreased overall survival in patients with (HR 1.928, p  0.001)"
Quantitative assessment of daratumumab in serum <i>via</i> intact light chain measurement using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry: a method suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Daratumumab, a pivotal treatment for multiple myeloma, exhibits considerable inter-patient variability in pharmacological clinical outcomes, likely attributed to serum concentration that may underscore the need for its therapeutic drug monitoring. This study aims to develop and validate a straightforward analytical method for quantifying daratumumab in serum, focusing on intact light chain determination, using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. The sample preparation involved immunoglobulin enrichment using Melon gel followed by a reduction step to dissociate the light from the heavy chains of immunoglobulins. The latter were then separated using a MabPac RP 2.1 × 50 mm chromatographic column and the intact light chains were detected and quantified using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer operating in ESI-positive ion mode at 17 500 resolution. The method demonstrated excellent linearity (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> > 0.992) across a serum concentration range of 100 to 2000 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> and good precision and accuracy: intra- and interday relative errors ranged from -5.1% to 6.5%, with a relative standard deviation of less than 5.8%. Clinical suitability was confirmed by analyzing 80 clinical samples from multiple myeloma patients treated with 1800 mg of daratumumab. 99% of the samples fell within the analytical range with a mean daratumumab concentration evaluated before the next administration (<i>C</i><sub>trough</sub>) of 398 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>. These findings highlighted that intact light chain monoclonal antibody quantification could be a valid and robust alternative to either immunoassays or to LC-MS/MS targeting peptides for measuring daratumumab in clinical samples, positioning it as a suitable method for therapeutic drug monitoring applications.",['Canil G; Miolo G; Simula M; Rupolo M; Steffan A; Corona G'],2024,daratumumab is a pivotal treatment for multiple myeloma. it exhibits significant inter-patient variability in clinical outcomes. the study aims to develop and validate a straightforward analytical method.
Identification of Potential Drug Targets of Calix[4]arene by Reverse Docking.,"Calixarenes are displaying great potential for the development of new drug delivery systems, diagnostic imaging, biosensing devices and inhibitors of biological processes. In particular, calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes and function as inhibitors. By screening of the potential drug target database (PDTD) with a reverse docking procedure, we identify and discuss a selection of 100 proteins that interact strongly with calix[4]arene. We also discover that leucine (23.5%), isoleucine (11.3%), phenylalanines (11.3%) and valine (9.5%) are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines and aromatic histidines, tyrosines and tryptophanes. Top binders are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors that already are targeted by commercial drugs, demonstrating the practical interest in calix[4]arene. Nuclear receptors, potassium channel, several carrier proteins, a variety of cancer-related proteins and viral proteins are prominent in the list. It is concluded that calix[4]arene, which is characterized by facile access, well-defined conformational characteristics, and ease of functionalization at both the lower and higher rims, could be a potential lead compound for the development of enzyme inhibitors and theranostic platforms.",['Giugliano G; Gajo M; Marforio TD; Zerbetto F; Mattioli EJ; Calvaresi M'],2024,"calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes. leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanines and valine are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines."
Nucleosomal asymmetry: a novel mechanism to regulate nucleosome function.,"Nucleosomes constitute the fundamental building blocks of chromatin. They are comprised of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer formed of two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Nucleosomal histones undergo a plethora of posttranslational modifications that regulate gene expression and other chromatin-templated processes by altering chromatin structure or by recruiting effector proteins. Given their symmetric arrangement, the sister histones within a nucleosome have commonly been considered to be equivalent and to carry the same modifications. However, it is now clear that nucleosomes can exhibit asymmetry, combining differentially modified sister histones or different variants of the same histone within a single nucleosome. Enabled by the development of novel tools that allow generating asymmetrically modified nucleosomes, recent biochemical and cell-based studies have begun to shed light on the origins and functional consequences of nucleosomal asymmetry. These studies indicate that nucleosomal asymmetry represents a novel regulatory mechanism in the establishment and functional readout of chromatin states. Asymmetry expands the combinatorial space available for setting up complex sets of histone marks at individual nucleosomes, regulating multivalent interactions with histone modifiers and readers. The resulting functional consequences of asymmetry regulate transcription, poising of developmental gene expression by bivalent chromatin, and the mechanisms by which oncohistones deregulate chromatin states in cancer. Here, we review recent progress and current challenges in uncovering the mechanisms and biological functions of nucleosomal asymmetry.",['Valsakumar D; Voigt P'],2024,nucleosomes undergo a plethora of posttranslational modifications. they regulate gene expression and other chromatin-templated processes. asymmetry is a novel regulatory mechanism in the establishment and readout of chromatin states.
Pacidusin B isolated from Phyllanthus acidus triggers ferroptotic cell death in HT1080 cells.,"Cancer cells generally exhibit 'iron addiction' phenotypes, which contribute to their vulnerability to ferroptosis inducers. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. In the present study, pacidusin B, a dichapetalin-type triterpenoid from Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels (Euphorbiaceae), induces ferroptosis in the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line. Cells treated with pacidusin B exhibited the morphological characteristic 'ballooning' phenotype of ferroptosis. The biochemical hallmarks of ferroptosis were also observed in pacidusin B-treated cells. Both oxidative stress and ER stress play significant roles in pacidusin B-induced ferroptosis. The activation of the PERK-Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway led to iron overload, while inhibition of GPX4 further sensitized cancer cells to ferroptosis. Furthermore, the molecular docking study showed that pacidusin B docked in the same pocket in xCT as the ferroptosis inducer erastin. These results revealed that pacidusin B exerts anticancer effects via inducing ER-mediated ferroptotic cell death.",['Zhu G; Luo D; Zhao Y; Xiang Z; Chen C; Li N; Hao X; Ding X; Zhang Y; Zhao Y'],2024,ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of programmed cell death caused by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. pacidusin B induces ferroptosis in the HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line. both oxidative stress and ER stress play significant roles in pacidusin B-induced ferroptosis.
Dietary restriction rescues 5-fluorouracil-induced lethal intestinal toxicity in old mice by blocking translocation of opportunistic pathogens.,"Chemotherapy remains a major treatment for malignant tumors, yet the application of standard dose intensity chemotherapy is limited due to the side effects of cytotoxic drugs, especially in old populations. The underlying mechanisms of cytotoxicity and strategies to increase the safety and tolerance of chemotherapy remain to be explored. Using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a cornerstone chemotherapeutic drug, we demonstrate that the main cause of death in <i>ad libitum</i> (AL) fed mice after 5-FU chemotherapy was infection caused by translocation of intestinal opportunistic pathogens. We show that these opportunistic pathogens greatly increase in the intestine after chemotherapy, which was closely related to loss of intestinal lysozyme. Of note, two weeks of dietary restriction (DR) prior to chemotherapy significantly protected the loss of lysozyme and increased the content of the beneficial <i>Lactobacillus</i> genera, resulting in a substantial inhibition of intestinal opportunistic pathogens and their translocation. The rescue effect of DR could be mimicked by Lysozyme or <i>Lactobacillus</i> gavage. Our study provides the first evidence that DR achieved a comprehensive protection of the intestinal physical, biological and chemical barriers, which significantly improved the overall survival of 5-FU-treated mice. Importantly, the above findings were more prominent in old mice. Furthermore, we show that patients over 65 years old have enriched opportunistic pathogens in their gut microbiota, especially after 5-FU based chemotherapy. Our study reveals important mechanisms for the poor chemotherapy tolerance of the elderly population, which can be significantly improved by short-term DR. This study generates new insights into methods for improving the chemotherapeutic prognosis by increasing the chemotherapy tolerance and safety of patients with malignant tumors.",['Tang D; Qiu R; Qiu X; Sun M; Su M; Tao Z; Zhang L; Tao S'],2024,chemotherapy remains a major treatment for malignant tumors. but the application of standard dose intensity chemotherapy is limited due to the side effects of cytotoxic drugs. underlying mechanisms of cytotoxicity and strategies to increase tolerance of chemotherapy remain to be explored.
Benign hepatic schwannoma in a patient with chronic hepatitis B infection: A case report.,"A primary benign hepatic schwannoma is an extremely rare disease with a good prognosis. A 55-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B was referred to our hospital because of jaundice, weight loss, and a hepatic lesion found during an ultrasound examination. Magnetic resonance image revealed a 55 × 120 mm solid mass lesion in the segment V and VIII of the liver. The mass extended directly to the segmental biliary ducts and common hepatic duct, causing obstruction of the biliary duct and upstream dilatation, particularly in the left liver lobe. Following the insertion of a percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, a biopsy was performed under ultrasound guidance. Histological examination confirmed a benign schwannoma, identified by characteristic pathological findings and positive immunoreactions with S-100 protein, but negative for c-kit, CD117, or CD34. The patient's tumor was removed and upon examination, it was discovered to be a mass filled with pinkish-yellow fluid, measuring 12 × 5 × 5 cm. This is the first known case of a benign schwannoma in the liver parenchyma of a patient with chronic hepatitis B.

Evolving or immutable - phase I solid tumor trials in the era of precision oncology.,"In the era of precision oncology (PO), systemic therapies for patients (pts) with solid tumors have shifted from chemotherapy (CT) to targeted therapy (TT) and immunotherapy (IO). This systematic survey describes features of trials enrolling between 2010 and 2020, focusing on inclusion criteria, type of dose escalation scheme (DES) utilized, and use of expansion cohorts (ECs). A literature search identified phase I studies in adults with solid tumors published January 1, 2000- December 31, 2020 from 12 journals. We included only studies enrolling between 2010 and 2020 to better capture the PO era. Two reviewers abstracted data; a third established concordance. Of 10,744 studies, 10,195 were non-topical or enrolled prior to 2010; 437 studies were included. The most common drug classes were TT (47.6%), IO (22%), and CT (6.9%). In studies which reported race, patients were predominantly white (61.7%) or Asian (25.7%), followed by black (6.5%) or other (6.1%). Heterogeneity was observed in the reporting and specification of study inclusion criteria. Only 40.1% of studies utilized ECs, and among the studies which used ECS, 46.6% were defined by genomic selection. Rule-based DES were used in 89% of trials; a 3+3 design was used in 80.5%. Of all drugs tested, 37.5% advanced to phase II, while 10.3% garnered regulatory licensure (for an indication tested in phase I). In the era of PO, TT and IO have emerged as the most studied agents in phase I trials. Rule-based DES, which are more relevant for escalating CT, are still chiefly utilized.",['Stockton SS; Ayers GD; Lee C; Laferriere H; Das S; Berlin J'],2024,systematic survey describes features of trials enrolling between 2010 and 2020.

"Association of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor use with risk of osteoporotic fracture among older women: A nationwide, population-based cohort study.","We investigated the relationship between sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and fracture in elderly women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and newly prescribed antidiabetic medications (ADMs). We used the population-based cohort study data from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea (2013-2020). Women ≥65 years old with T2DM, who were newly prescribed ADMs other than glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and thiazolidinedione, and who had comprehensive health check-up data were included. A total of 1,333 SGLT2i users were matched in a 1:2 ratio with 2,626 non-SGLT2i users.

The association of preoperative hematologic parameters with short-term clinical outcomes in rectal cancer: A feature importance analysis.,"Various hematologic parameters have been proposed as prognostic factors in rectal cancer management, but data are conflicting and unclear. This study is designed to investigate the prognostic factor capability of preoperative hematologic parameters with postoperative morbidities and mortality in rectal cancer patients undergoing curative resection. All 200 consecutive rectal cancer patients diagnosed at Ghaem University Hospital from 2017 to 2022 were retrospectively evaluated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and machine learning (ML) algorithms of Random Forest, Recursive Feature Elimination, simulated annealing, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting were administered to investigate the role of preoperative hematologic parameters accompanied by baseline characteristics on three clinical outcomes including surgical infectious complications, recurrence, and death. The frequency of infectious complications was correlated with the surgical procedure, while tumor recurrence was significantly influenced by T stage and N stage. In terms of mortality, alongside T and N stage, the status of resection margin involvement was significantly correlated. Based on the ROC analysis, the NLR >2.69, MPV ≤9 fL, and PDW ≤10.5 fL were more classified patients to mortality status.

Oligo-Adenine and Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular DNA-Based Hydrogels Exhibiting Acid-Resistance and Physiological pH-Responsiveness.,"Expanding the functions and applications of DNA by integrating noncanonical bases and structures into biopolymers is a continuous scientific effort. An adenine-rich strand (A-strand) is introduced as functional scaffold revealing, in the presence of the low-molecular-weight cofactor cyanuric acid (CA, p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 6.9), supramolecular hydrogel-forming efficacies demonstrating multiple pH-responsiveness. At pH 1.2, the A-strand transforms into a parallel A-motif duplex hydrogel cross-linked by AH<sup>+</sup>-H<sup>+</sup>A units due to the protonation of adenine (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> 3.5). At pH 5.2, and in the presence of coadded CA, a helicene-like configuration is formed between adenine and protonated CA, generating a parallel A-CA triplex cross-linked hydrogel. At pH 8.0, the hydrogel undergoes transition into a liquid state by deprotonation of CA cofactor units and disassembly of A-CA triplex into its constituent components. Density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations, supporting the structural reconfigurations of A-strand in the presence of CA, are performed. The sequential pH-stimulated hydrogel states are rheometrically characterized. The hydrogel framework is loaded with fluorescein-labeled insulin, and the pH-stimulated release of insulin from the hydrogel across the pH barriers present in the gastrointestinal tract is demonstrated.

The role of peripheral white blood cell counts in the association between central adiposity and glycemic status.,"Although central adiposity is a well-known risk factor for diabetes, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the potential mediation role of circulating WBC counts in the association between central adiposity and the risk of diabetes. A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the Fuqing cohort study, which included 6,613 participants aged 35-75 years. Logistic regression analysis and Spearman's rank correlation analysis were used to examine the relationships between waist-to-hip ratio, WBC counts and glycemic status. Both simple and parallel multiple mediation models were used to explore the potential mediation effects of WBCs on the association of waist-to-hip ratio with diabetes. The study revealed a positive relationship between waist-to-hip ratio and risk of prediabetes (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.74) and diabetes (OR = 2.89; 95% CI, 2.45 to 3.40). Moreover, elevated peripheral WBC counts were associated with both central adiposity and worsening glycemic status (P < 0.05). The mediation analysis with single mediators demonstrated that there is a significant indirect effect of central adiposity on prediabetes risk through total WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and monocyte count; the proportions mediated were 9.92%, 6.98%, 6.07%, and 3.84%, respectively. Additionally, total WBC count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count and basophil count mediated 11.79%, 11.51%, 6.29%, 4.78%, and 1.76%, respectively, of the association between central adiposity and diabetes. In the parallel multiple mediation model using all five types of WBC as mediators simultaneously, a significant indirect effect (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.14) were observed, with a mediated proportion of 12.77%.

Insulin overdose with fatal outcome?: Two forensic cases.,"Intentional overdose with insulin preparations is rare. However, fatal consequences due to severe hypoglycemia could occur. Postmortem toxicology screening of insulin is a challenge, given the chemical characteristics of this protein and the difficulty of distinguishing between endogenous and exogenous insulin in blood. Here, we describe two cases of patients with diabetes using insulin and oral anti-diabetics. The main question in both cases was whether or not disturbance in glucose metabolism contributed to death. In case A, there was strong evidence that self-poisoning with insulin and subsequent hypoglycemia caused the death. However, this could not be confirmed due to lack of adequate forensic toxicology tests. In case B, no hypoglycemia was observed. Though, compared with case A, additional forensic examination was performed to investigate whether glycemic disturbances could have contributed to the death. In this report, we focus on the most appropriate analytical methods for the detection of exogenous insulin in the human body and give recommendations for toxicology testing of glucose levels and insulin in postmortem specimens.",['Embaby A; Balai M; Franssen EJF'],2024,"postmortem toxicology screening of insulin is a challenge. the main question in both cases was whether or not disturbance in glucose metabolism contributed to death. in case B, no hypoglycemia was observed."
Feasibility and acceptability of a tailored health coaching intervention to improve type 2 diabetes self-management in Saudi Arabia: a mixed-methods randomised feasibility trial.,"Around one-third of the population of Saudi Arabia have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, a condition often requiring lifestyle changes.

We aim to explore the feasibility and acceptability of tailored health coaching in Saudi Arabia, in order to help those with type 2 diabetes to more effectively manage their condition. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research involved a randomised controlled trial with 30 Saudi adults who have type 2 diabetes. They were randomly allocated into either the intervention or control arm for 12 weeks. The Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour framework was used to guide the intervention implementation along with the Behaviour Change Techniques Taxonomy V.1. The primary goal was to assess the suitability and duration of the intervention, recruitment, retention and completion rates. The secondary outcome focused on the preliminary efficacy of the health coaching measured by the glycaemic index, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, weight, patient self-efficacy and diabetes self-management. The results showed high rates of eligibility, recruitment and retention (a screening rate of 90%, a recruiting rate of 79% and a retention rate of 97%). Notable improvements were observed in the health coaching group across five outcomes: haemoglobin A1c, BMI, waist circumference, patient self-efficacy and diabetes self-care. Qualitative findings highlighted the participants' perceived benefits from the intervention, including enhanced motivation, better understanding of diabetes management and a supportive coaching relationship. Participants expressed high satisfaction with the intervention and advocated for its expansion. The findings demonstrated positive outcomes, supporting the need for a larger randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of health coaching in improving diabetes self-management among individuals with type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia.",['Almulhim AN; Alhowaish A; Madani A; AlQaddan M; Altuwalah AS; Goyder E'],2024,one-third of the population of Saudi Arabia have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. the strategy is designed to help individuals with type 2 diabetes manage their condition. the study involved a randomised controlled trial with 30 adults who have type 2 diabetes.
Comprehensive data mining reveals RTK/RAS signaling pathway as a promoter of prostate cancer lineage plasticity through transcription factors and CNV.,"Prostate cancer lineage plasticity is a key driver in the transition to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), and the RTK/RAS signaling pathway is a well-established cancer pathway. Nevertheless, the comprehensive link between the RTK/RAS signaling pathway and lineage plasticity has received limited investigation. In particular, the intricate regulatory network governing the interplay between RTK/RAS and lineage plasticity remains largely unexplored. The multi-omics data were clustered with the coefficient of argument and neighbor joining algorithm. Subsequently, the clustered results were analyzed utilizing the GSEA, gene sets related to stemness, multi-lineage state datasets, and canonical cancer pathway gene sets. Finally, a comprehensive exploration of the data based on the ssGSEA, WGCNA, GSEA, VIPER, prostate cancer scRNA-seq data, and the GPSAdb database was conducted. Among the six modules in the clustering results, there are 300 overlapping genes, including 3 previously unreported prostate cancer genes that were validated to be upregulated in prostate cancer through RT-qPCR. Function Module 6 shows a positive correlation with prostate cancer cell stemness, multi-lineage states, and the RTK/RAS signaling pathway. Additionally, the 19 leading-edge genes of the RTK/RAS signaling pathway promote prostate cancer lineage plasticity through a complex network of transcriptional regulation and copy number variations. In the transcriptional regulation network, TP63 and FOXO1 act as suppressors of prostate cancer lineage plasticity, whereas RORC exerts a promoting effect. This study provides a comprehensive perspective on the role of the RTK/RAS pathway in prostate cancer lineage plasticity and offers new clues for the treatment of NEPC.",['Wei G; Zhang X; Liu S; Hou W; Dai Z'],2024,"the complex regulatory network governing interplay between the RTK/RAS signaling pathway and lineage plasticity remains unexplored. the multi-omics data were clustered with the coefficient of argument and neighbor joining algorithm. among the six modules in the clustering results, there are 300 overlapping genes, including 3 previously unreported prostate cancer genes that were validated to be upregulated in prostate cancer through RT-qPCR."
"The oral nucleoside prodrug GS-5245 is efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic, epidemic, and enzootic coronaviruses.","Despite the wide availability of several safe and effective vaccines that prevent severe COVID-19, the persistent emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) that can evade vaccine-elicited immunity remains a global health concern. In addition, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that can evade therapeutic monoclonal antibodies underscores the need for additional, variant-resistant treatment strategies. Here, we characterize the antiviral activity of GS-5245, obeldesivir (ODV), an oral prodrug of the parent nucleoside GS-441524, which targets the highly conserved viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We show that GS-5245 is broadly potent in vitro against alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-related bat-CoV RsSHC014, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 WA/1, and the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 BA.1 Omicron variant. Moreover, in mouse models of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (WA/1 and Omicron B1.1.529), MERS-CoV, and bat-CoV RsSHC014 pathogenesis, we observed a dose-dependent reduction in viral replication, body weight loss, acute lung injury, and pulmonary function with GS-5245 therapy. Last, we demonstrate that a combination of GS-5245 and main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) inhibitor nirmatrelvir improved outcomes in vivo against SARS-CoV-2 compared with the single agents. Together, our data support the clinical evaluation of GS-5245 against coronaviruses that cause or have the potential to cause human disease.",['Martinez DR; Moreira FR; Catanzaro NJ; Diefenbacher MV; Zweigart MR; Gully KL; De la Cruz G; Brown AJ; Adams LE; Yount B; Baric TJ; Mallory ML; Conrad H; May SR; Dong S; Scobey DT; Nguyen C; Montgomery SA; Perry JK; Babusis D; Barrett KT; Nguyen AH; Nguyen AQ; Kalla R; Bannister R; Feng JY; Cihlar T; Baric RS; Mackman RL; Bilello JP; Schäfer A; Sheahan TP'],2024,"emergence of obeldesivir (ODV) variants of concern.

The mediating role of kynurenine pathway metabolites on the relationship between inflammation and muscle mass in oldest-old men.,"Tryptophan (TRP) metabolites along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway (KP) have been found to influence muscle. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to stimulate the degradation of TRP down the KP. Given that both inflammation and KP metabolites have been connected with loss of muscle, we assessed the potential mediating role of KP metabolites on inflammation and muscle mass in older men. 505 men (85.0±4.2yrs) from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men cohort study with measured D3-creatine dilution (D3Cr) muscle mass, KP metabolites, and inflammation markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and a subsample (n=305) with interleukin (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-17A) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)) were included in the analysis. KP metabolites and inflammatory markers were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and immunoassays, respectively. 23-92% of the inverse relationship between inflammatory markers and D3Cr muscle mass was mediated by KP metabolites (indirect effect p<0.05). 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), quinolinic acid (QA), TRP, xanthurenic acid (XA), KYN/TRP, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK)/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA, and nicotinamide (NAM)/QA mediated the AGP relationship. 3-HAA, QA, KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, HKr ratio, 3-HK/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA, and NAM/QA mediated the CRP. KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, and NAM/QA explained the relationship for IL-6 and 3-HK/XA and QA/3-HAA for TNF-α. No mediation effect was observed for the other cytokines (indirect effect p>0.05). KP metabolites, particularly higher ratios of KYN/TRP, 3-HK/XA, 3-HK/3-HAA, QA/3-HAA and a lower ratio of NAM/QA, mediated the relationship between inflammation and low muscle mass. Our preliminary cross-sectional data suggest that interventions to alter D3Cr muscle mass may focus on KP metabolites rather than inflammation per se.",['Hetherington-Rauth M; Johnson E; Migliavacca E; Langsetmo L; Hepple RT; Ryan TE; Ferrucci L; Breuillé D; Corthesy J; Lane NE; Feige JN; Napoli N; Tramontana F; Orwoll ES; Cawthon PM'],2024,tryptophan (TRP) metabolites along the kynurenine pathway (KP) have been found to influence muscle. pro-inflammatory cytokines are known to stimulate the degradation of TRP down the KP.
Machine learning designs new GCGR/GLP-1R dual agonists with enhanced biological potency.,"Several peptide dual agonists of the human glucagon receptor (GCGR) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity and their associated complications. Candidates must have high potency at both receptors, but it is unclear whether the limited experimental data available can be used to train models that accurately predict the activity at both receptors of new peptide variants. Here we use peptide sequence data labelled with in vitro potency at human GCGR and GLP-1R to train several models, including a deep multi-task neural-network model using multiple loss optimization. Model-guided sequence optimization was used to design three groups of peptide variants, with distinct ranges of predicted dual activity. We found that three of the model-designed sequences are potent dual agonists with superior biological activity. With our designs we were able to achieve up to sevenfold potency improvement at both receptors simultaneously compared to the best dual-agonist in the training set.",['Puszkarska AM; Taddese B; Revell J; Davies G; Field J; Hornigold DC; Buchanan A; Vaughan TJ; Colwell LJ'],2024,"peptide dual agonists of the human glucagon receptor (GCGR) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) are in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity and their associated complications."
Novel insights into the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer grading system for lung adenocarcinoma.,"The new grading system for lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) defines prognostic subgroups based on histologic patterns observed on surgical specimens. This study seeks to provide novel insights into the IASLC grading system, with a particular focus on recurrence-specific survival (RSS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) among patients with stage I ADC. Under the IASLC grading system, tumors were classified as grade 1 (lepidic predominant with <20% high-grade patterns [micropapillary, solid, complex glandular]), grade 2 (acinar or papillary predominant with <20% high-grade patterns), or grade 3 (≥20% high-grade patterns). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, pathologic features, and genomic profiles were investigated for patients whose disease was reclassified to a higher grade under the IASLC grading system on the basis of the hypothesis that they would strongly resemble patients with predominant high-grade tumors. Overall, 423 of 1443 patients (29%) with grade 1 or 2 tumors by the predominant pattern-based grading system had their tumors upgraded to grade 3 by the IASLC grading system. The RSS curves for patients with upgraded tumors were significantly different from those for patients with grade 1 or 2 tumors (log-rank p<0.001) but not from those for patients with predominant high-grade patterns (p=0.3). Patients with upgraded tumors had a similar incidence of visceral pleural invasion and spread of tumor through air spaces as patients with predominant high-grade patterns. In multivariable models, the IASLC grading system remained significantly associated with RSS and LCSS after adjustment for aggressive pathologic features such as visceral pleural invasion and spread of tumor through air spaces. The IASLC grading system outperforms the predominant pattern-based grading system and appropriately reclassifies tumors into higher grades with worse prognosis, even after other pathologic features of aggressiveness are considered.",['Tan KS; Reiner A; Emoto K; Eguchi T; Takahashi Y; Aly RG; Rekhtman N; Adusumilli PS; Travis WD'],2024,the new grading system for lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) is proposed by the international association for the study of lung cancer. the study seeks to provide novel insights into the IASLC grading system. tumors were classified as grade 1 (lepidic predominant with 20% high-grade patterns) and grade 2 (acinar or papillary predominant with 20% high-grade patterns)
Living with diabetes in Northeast India: An exploration of psychosocial factors in management.,"India is the 'Diabetes Capital of the World' and accounts for one in seven adults living with diabetes worldwide. Psychosocial, economic, and cultural correlates of disease have important implications for disease management but are rarely explored in India. The purpose of this study is to address psychosocial and cultural factors in diabetes management in the northeastern region of India which has a high disease burden. This study attempts to explore the psychosocial and lived experience of diabetes in the northeastern state of Meghalaya. The sample was selected from individuals attending an outpatient facility of a multi-speciality clinic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 individuals (13 women and 12 men), above the age of 40 years, who had been diagnosed with diabetes for at least 6 months. The narratives were analysed using thematic analysis. Using the social cognitive framework, themes were organized in terms of a thematic map linking knowledge of diabetes to the perception of diabetes as 'a silent killer', to coping, leading to self-efficacy. However high self-efficacy, over time, may lead to complacency, disrupting health behaviours and requiring re-establishment of those behaviours. Adequate knowledge along with cognitive adaptation and self-efficacy were important constructs that contributed to behaviour change and maintenance. Elements of the cultural context were observed in the spiritual aspects of adaptation, the socially isolating consequences of diabetes, as well as gender differences in social support and management. Understanding the lived experiences of patients contributes to planning more effective interventions keeping the social and cultural context in mind for more effective management of diabetes. Additionally, acknowledging and supporting women's needs in diabetes management is called for.",['Kharsati N; Kulkarni M'],2024,study attempts to explore the psychosocial and lived experience of diabetes in northeastern state of meghalaya. the sample was selected from individuals attending an outpatient facility of a multi-speciality clinic.
Mesenchymal stem cells-macrophages crosstalk and myeloid malignancy.,"As major components of the tumor microenvironment, both mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages can be remodelled and exhibit different phenotypes and functions during tumor initiation and progression. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a crucial role in the growth, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance of hematological malignancies, and are associated with poor prognosis. Consequently, TAMs have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. Notably, MSCs exert a profound influence on modulating immune cell functions such as macrophages and granulocytes, thereby playing a crucial role in shaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding tumors. However, in hematological malignancies, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between MSCs and macrophages have not been clearly elucidated. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of TAMs in various common hematological malignancies, and discuss the latest advances in understanding the interaction between MSCs and macrophages in disease progression. Additionally, potential therapeutic approaches targeting this relationship are outlined.",['Li K; Nie H; Jin R; Wu X'],2024,tumor-associated macrophages play a crucial role in tumor initiation and progression. hematological malignancies are associated with poor prognosis. hematological malignancies are associated with poor prognosis.
Cellular landscape of adrenocortical carcinoma at single-nuclei resolution.,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare yet devastating tumour of the adrenal gland with a molecular pathology that remains incompletely understood. To gain novel insights into the cellular landscape of ACC, we generated single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data sets from twelve ACC tumour samples and analysed these alongside snRNA-seq data sets from normal adrenal glands (NAGs). We find the ACC tumour microenvironment to be relatively devoid of immune cells compared to NAG tissues, consistent with known high tumour purity values for ACC as an immunologically ""cold"" tumour. Our analysis identifies three separate groups of ACC samples that are characterised by different relative compositions of adrenocortical cell types. These include cell populations that are specifically enriched in the most clinically aggressive and hormonally active tumours, displaying hallmarks of reorganised cell mechanobiology and dysregulated steroidogenesis, respectively. We also identified and validated a population of mitotically active adrenocortical cells that strongly overexpress genes POLQ, DIAPH3 and EZH2 to support tumour expansion alongside an LGR4+ progenitor-like or cell-of-origin candidate for adrenocortical carcinogenesis. Trajectory inference suggests the fate adopted by malignant adrenocortical cells upon differentiation is associated with the copy number or allelic balance state of the imprinted DLK1/MEG3 genomic locus, which we verified by assessing bulk tumour DNA methylation status. In conclusion, our results therefore provide new insights into the clinical and cellular heterogeneity of ACC, revealing how genetic perturbations to healthy adrenocortical renewal and zonation provide a molecular basis for disease pathogenesis.",['Tourigny DS; Altieri B; Secener KA; Sbiera S; Schauer MP; Arampatzi P; Herterich S; Sauer S; Fassnacht M; Ronchi CL'],2024,ACC is a rare yet devastating tumour of the adrenal gland. the tumour microenvironment is relatively devoid of immune cells.

Comparative Analysis of Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate and TNF-Alpha Inhibitors in Mitigating Cisplatin-Induced Pancreatic Damage Through Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis Pathways.,"Oxidative stress and inflammation caused by cisplatin, which is frequently used in the treatment of many cancers, damage healthy tissues as well as cancer cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and infliximab (INF) administration on pancreatic endocrine cells in rats treated with systemic cisplatin (CDDP). The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: group 1 (control group), group 2 (EGCG group), group 3 (CDDP group), group 4 (EGCG + CDDP group), group 5 (CDDP + INF group), and group 6 (EGCG + CDDP + INF group). The study's findings demonstrated that EGCG and INF effectively reduced the cellular damage induced by CDDP in histopathologic investigations of the pancreas. EGCG and INF, whether used individually or in combination, demonstrated a significant reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and an increase in glutathione (GSH) levels in the rat pancreas compared to the CDDP group. Immunohistochemically, the enhanced presence of insulin and glucagon positivity in the EGCG and INF groups, along with the absence of TUNEL immunopositivity, indicate that both treatments reduced CDDP-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the observed lack of immunopositivity in TNF-α and 8-OHdG in the groups treated with EGCG and INF, compared to those treated with CDDP, indicates that these substances can inhibit inflammation. EGCG and INF, whether provided alone or together, can potentially reduce the damage caused to pancreatic islet cells by cisplatin. This effect is achieved through their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties during the early stages of the condition.",['Ciftel E; Mercantepe F; Mercantepe T; Akyildiz K; Yilmaz A; Ciftel S'],2024,cisplatin is frequently used in the treatment of many cancers. it is often used in the treatment of many cancers. apoptosis is a major cause of inflammation and apoptosis.

Two weeks later, he presented with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and a nearly obliterated anterior chamber with coagulated blood behind the lens in the RE. We performed two rounds of surgery, including cataract surgery, vitrectomy, and sclerotomy. The choroidal detachment was clearly visible behind the posterior capsule during the cataract surgery. The surgical intervention successfully lowered the IOP and alleviated the pain.

Effect of Brain-gut Behavioral Treatments on Abdominal Pain in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"Some brain-gut behavioral treatments (BGBTs) are beneficial for global symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). US management guidelines suggest their use in patients with persistent abdominal pain but their specific effect on this symptom has not been assessed systematically. We searched the literature through 16<sup>th</sup> December 2023 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing efficacy of BGBTs for adults with IBS, compared with each other, or a control intervention. Trials provided an assessment of abdominal pain resolution or improvement at treatment completion. We extracted data as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming dropouts to be treatment failures and reporting pooled relative risks (RRs) of abdominal pain not improving with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), ranking therapies according to P-score. We identified 42 eligible RCTs, containing 5220 participants. After treatment completion, the BGBTs with the largest numbers of trials, and patients recruited, demonstrating efficacy for abdominal pain, specifically, included self-guided/minimal contact cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (RR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.54-0.95, P-score 0.58), face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy (RR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.54-0.97, P score 0.56), and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy (RR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.96, P-score 0.49). Among trials recruiting only patients with refractory global IBS symptoms, group CBT was more efficacious than routine care for abdominal pain, but no other significant differences were detected. No trials were low risk of bias across all domains and there was evidence of funnel plot asymmetry. Several BGBTs, including self-guided/minimal contact CBT, face-to-face multicomponent behavioral therapy, and face-to-face gut-directed hypnotherapy may be efficacious for abdominal pain in IBS, although none were superior to another.",['Goodoory VC; Khasawneh M; Thakur ER; Everitt HA; Gudleski GD; Lackner JM; Moss-Morris R; Simren M; Vasant DH; Moayyedi P; Black CJ; Ford AC'],2024,BGBTs are beneficial for global symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to assess efficacy of BGBTs.

Increased genetic risk for β-cell failure is associated with β-cell function decline in people with prediabetes.,"Partitioned polygenic scores (pPS) have been developed to capture pathophysiologic processes underlying type 2 diabetes (T2D). We investigated the influence of T2D pPS on diabetes-related traits and T2D incidence in the Diabetes Prevention Program. We generated five T2D pPS (β-cell, proinsulin, liver/lipid, obesity, lipodystrophy) in 2,647 participants randomized to intensive lifestyle, metformin or placebo arms. Associations were tested using general linear models and Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, and principal components. Sensitivity analyses included adjustment for BMI. Higher β-cell pPS was associated with lower insulinogenic index and corrected insulin response at one year follow-up adjusted for baseline measures (effect per pPS standard deviation (SD) -0.04, P=9.6 x 10-7; -8.45 uU/mg, P=5.6 x 10-6, respectively) and with increased diabetes incidence adjusted for BMI at nominal significance (HR 1.10 per SD, P=0.035). The liver/lipid pPS was associated with reduced one-year baseline-adjusted triglyceride levels (effect per SD -4.37, P=0.001). There was no significant interaction between T2D pPS and randomized groups. The remaining pPS were associated with baseline measures only. We conclude that despite interventions for diabetes prevention, participants with a high genetic burden of the β-cell cluster pPS had worsening in measures of β-cell function.",['Billings LK; Jablonski KA; Pan Q; Franks PW; Goldberg RB; Hivert MF; Kahn SE; Knowler WC; Lee CG; Merino J; Huerta-Chagoya A; Mercader JM; Raghavan S; Shi Z; Srinivasan S; Xu J; Florez JC; Udler MS'],2024,pPS was associated with lower insulinogenic index and corrected insulin response. pPS was associated with reduced one-year baseline-adjusted triglyceride levels.
The efficiency and safety of temozolomide and PD-1/L1 inhibitors in pretreated NSCLC with brain metastasis: a retrospective cohort.,"Previous research has shown that both temozolomide (TMZ) and PD-1/L1 inhibitors (PD-1/L1) alone exhibit certain potential in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases (BM), in this study, we will explore combining the two in order to seek new effective treatment options for NSCLC with BM. During 2021.1 to 2023.12, we collected the date of these pretreated-NSCLC with BM who accept the treatment of TMZ and PD-1/L1, the objective response ratio (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were set as the primary endpoint, meanwhile, the toxicity of such regimen was also recorded. About 42 patients are enrolled, our primary analysis demonstrated that the ORR of such regimen toward NSCLC with BM was 26.19%, with Approximate intracranial and extracranial lesion ORR was 6% and 20% respectively, the DCR was about 64.29%, the mean PFS and OS was about 4 m and 8.5 m. Further analysis indicated that the efficiency correlated with the diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (ds-GPA) score. Moreover, the toxicity can also be tolerated, indicating the application potential of such regimen against NSCLC with BM. Our results exhibited that with tolerated toxicity, the combination of TMZ and PD-1/L1 shows promising efficiency against NSCLC with BM, this would be of great significance for the treatment of NSCLC with brain metastasis. However, due to the limitation of sample and retrospective property, the real value of such regimen needed to be further confirmed in the future.",['Li X; Wu D; Tang J; Wu Y'],2024,TMZ and PD-1/L1 inhibitors alone exhibit certain potential in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Hesperidin reduces systolic blood pressure in diabetic patients and has no effect on blood pressure in healthy individuals: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In recent years, there have been a number of studies where hesperidin was administered to modify arterial blood pressure, but the conclusions of each study are contradictory. In order to investigate the effect of hesperidin on blood pressure, we searched the CNKI, Wanfang Database, the VIP database, Sinomed database, Pubmed, Embase and The Cochrane Library databases, and searched the literature on hesperidin and blood pressure published in Chinese and English journals, mainly focusing on patients' systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. The search time frame was from the inception of the databases until December 2023. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the overall quality and used Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) to measure agreement. We did preliminary screening of the retrieved literature through Notexpress, 14 articles with a total of 656 patients were included. Cochrance data conversion tool was used for data conversion, and RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analysis, and finally Stata was used to make the Egger's test for the included study. The results of total population blood pressure showed that hesperidin had no antihypertensive effect on the population, but the conclusions changed when the population was divided into groups. The results of different populations showed that hesperidin had no effect on systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.50, 95% CI: -3.25 ~ 2.26, Z = 0.35, p = 0.72) and diastolic blood pressure (WMD = -0.51, 95% CI: -2.53 ~ 1.51, Z = 0.50, p = 0.62) in healthy individuals. However, hesperidin reduced systolic blood pressure in patients with type 2 diabetes (WMD = -4.32, 95% CI: - 7.77 ~ - 0.87, Z = 2.45, p = 0.01), and had a tendency to reduce diastolic blood pressure in diabetic patients (WMD = -3.72, 95% CI: -7.63 ~ 0.18, Z = 1.87, p = 0.06). The results in patients with type 2 diabetes needed to be further supported by future research focusing on individuals with diabetes.",['Gao H; Chen F; Wang S'],2024,hesperidin was administered to modify arterial blood pressure. the results of the study were contradictory. the results of different populations showed that hesperidin had no effect on systolic blood pressure.
Definitive single-stage surgery for treating diabetic foot osteomyelitis: a protocolized pathway including antibiotic bone graft substitute use.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a challenging complication of diabetes mellitus, often leading to poor clinical outcomes and significant socioeconomic burdens. We evaluated the effectiveness of a definitive single-stage protocolized surgical management pathway, including the use of local antibiotic bone graft substitute, for the treatment of infected DFUs with associated osteomyelitis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Medical records were extracted (from January 2017 to December 2020) to establish a database consisting of patients who underwent surgical intervention for the treatment of an infected DFU with osteomyelitis. Patients were divided into conventional (control) and protocolized (intervention) surgical groups depending on the treatment received. Clinical outcomes were assessed over a 12-month follow-up period. A total of 136 consecutive patients were included (conventional = 33, protocolized = 103). The protocolized group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the mean number of operations performed per patient (1.2 vs. 3.5) (P < 0.001) and a shorter accumulative hospital length of stay (12.6 vs. 25.1 days) (P < 0.001) compared to the conventional group. Major amputation rates were significantly lower in the protocolized group (2% vs. 18%) (P < 0.001). Within 12 months of surgical intervention, the protocolized group exhibited an ulcer healing rate of 89%, with a low rate of recurrence (3%). The protocolized surgical pathway, including local antibiotic bone graft substitute use, demonstrated superior outcomes compared to conventional management for the treatment of infected DFUs with osteomyelitis. Further research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and generalizability of this approach.",['Chow J; Imani S; Kavisinghe I; Mittal R; Martin B'],2024,a retrospective cohort study was conducted. the protocolized surgical management pathway demonstrated superior outcomes. the protocolized surgical pathway included local antibiotic bone graft substitute.

Reproductive Factors and Thyroid Cancer Risk: The Multiethnic Cohort Study.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer than men, with incidence rates per 100,000 in the United States of 20.2 for women and 7.4 for men. Several reproductive and hormonal factors have been proposed as possible contributors to thyroid cancer risk, including age at menarche, parity, age at menopause, oral contraceptive use, surgical menopause, and menopausal hormone therapy. Our study aimed to investigate potential reproductive/hormonal factors in a multiethnic population. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Risk factors for thyroid cancer were evaluated among female participants (<i>n</i> = 118,344) of the Multiethnic Cohort Study. The cohort was linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer incidence and statewide death certificate files in Hawaii and California, with 373 incident papillary thyroid cancer cases identified. Exposures investigated include age at menarche, parity, first pregnancy outcome, birth control use, and menopausal status and type. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain relative risk (RR) of papillary thyroid cancer and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Covariates included age, race and ethnicity, reproductive history, body size, smoking, and alcohol consumption. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We observed a statistically significant increased risk of papillary thyroid cancer for oophorectomy (adjusted RR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.99), hysterectomy (adjusted RR 1.65, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.04), and surgical menopause (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI: 1.22, 1.97), and decreased risk for first live birth at ≤20 years of age versus nulliparity (adjusted RR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.93). These associations did not vary by race and ethnicity (<i>p</i> het > 0.44). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> The reproductive risk factors for papillary thyroid cancer reported in the literature were largely confirmed in all racial and ethnic groups in our multiethnic population, which validates uniform obstetric and gynecological practice.",['Abe JV; Park SY; Haiman CA; Le Marchand L; Hernandez BY; Ihenacho U; Wilkens LR'],2024,"women are three times more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer than men. incidence rates per 100,000 in the united states are 20.2 for women and 7.4 for men. a multiethnic population has a number of reproductive and hormonal factors."
LncRNA microarray profiling identifies novel circulating lncRNAs in hidradenitis suppurativa.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in biological processes, both physiological and pathological, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune hepatitis and types I and II diabetes. LncRNAs are also known to have a critical role in the physiology of skin, and in the pathology of cutaneous diseases. LncRNAs are involved in a wide range of biological activities, including transcriptional post‑transcriptional processes, epigenetics, RNA splicing, gene activation and or silencing, modifications and/or editing; therefore, lncRNAs may be useful as potential targets for disease treatment. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), also termed acne inversa, is a major skin disease, being an inflammatory disorder that affects ~1% of global population in a chronic manner. Its pathogenesis, however, is only partly understood, although immune dysregulation is known to have an important role. To investigate the biological relevance of lncRNAs with HS, the most differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were first compared. Furthermore, the lncRNA‑microRNA regulatory network was also defined via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR analysis, whereby a trio of lncRNA expression signatures, lncRNA‑TINCR, lncRNA‑RBM5‑ASI1 and lncRNA‑MRPL23‑AS1, were found to be significantly overexpressed in patients with HS compared with healthy controls. In conclusion, the three lncRNAs isolated in the present study may be useful for improving the prognostic prediction of HS, as well as contributing towards an improved understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, thereby potentially providing new therapeutic targets.",['De Felice B; De Luca P; Montanino C; Mallardo M; Babino G; Mattera E; Sorbo R; Ragozzino G; Argenziano G; Daniele A; Nigro E'],2024,long noncoding RNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in biological processes. lncRNAs are also known to have a critical role in the physiology of skin. lncRNAs are also known to have a critical role in the pathology of cutaneous diseases.
Rare metastasis in a patient with BRAF-mutated rectal cancer: choroidal metastasis - case report and literature review.,"Colorectal cancers are common and have high mortality, and metastasis is common in follow up. Choroidal metastasis is encountered rarely in rectum cancers, and there is no previous case reported from Turkey. We present our patient who developed choroidal metastasis in his cancer follow-up. A 74-year-old male patient had undergone operation due to the diagnosis of rectum cancer two years ago, and lung (L) metastasis developed in the 4<sup>th</sup> month after the adjuvant therapy, but he refused to receive treatment and remained out of follow-up. The patient presented with complaints of decreased vision and light flashes in his eye 21 months after the diagnosis. Ocular examination revealed a choroidal mass and radiologically choroidal and multiple brain metastases were detected. In our case, whole-brain radiotherapy was administered in the treatment since there were also multiple brain metastases. However, as the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of the patient was 3-4 after radiotherapy, systemic treatment was not considered appropriate, and the best supportive care was given. The patient died 2 months after the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis. Currently, there are few suggestions in case reports regarding appropriate treatment approaches for the treatment of rectal cancerchoroidal metastases. Multidisciplinary approaches may be effective for local and systemic treatment. Our case highlights a pathological entity with poor prognosis, which is rarely encountered during the course of rectal adenocarcinomas, and it is the first case of choroidal metastasis reported from our country. However, we believe that it will be important to draw attention to the fact that it is the first reported case of choroid metastasis in a rectal cancer patient with a BRAF V600 E mutation, and patients with BRAF V600 E mutation may develop metastasis to atypical areas due to their aggressive biology.",['Demir H; Ekim MM; Özgül E; Davarci SE; Baykara M'],2024,choroidal metastasis is encountered rarely in rectum cancers. there is no previous case reported from turkey. 74-year-old male patient had undergone surgery due to rectum cancer.
Identifying symptom clusters and temporal interconnections in patients with lung tumors after CT-guided microwave ablation: A network analysis.,"To explore symptom clusters and interrelationships using a network analysis approach among symptoms in patients with lung tumors who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided microwave ablation (MWA). A longitudinal study was conducted, and 196 lung tumor patients undergoing MWA were recruited and were measured at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after MWA. The Chinese version of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and the Revised Lung Cancer Module were used to evaluate symptoms. Network analyses were performed to explore the symptom clusters and interrelationships among symptoms. Four stable symptom communities were identified within the networks. Distress, weight loss, and chest tightness were the central symptoms. Distress, and weight loss were also the most key bridge symptoms, followed by cough. Three symptom networks were temporally stable in terms of symptom centrality, global connectivity, and network structure. Our findings identified the central symptoms, bridge symptoms, and the stability of symptom networks of patients with lung tumors after MWA. These network results will have important implications for future targeted symptom management intervention development. Future research should focus on developing precise interventions for targeting central symptoms and bridge symptoms to promote patients' health.",['Liu C; Liu T; Fang J; Liu X; Du C; Luo Q; Song L; Liu G; Li W; Li W; Geng L'],2024,196 lung tumor patients undergoing MWA were recruited. a longitudinal study was conducted. a longitudinal study was conducted.
Proteasome gene expression is controlled by coordinated functions of multiple transcription factors.,"Proteasome activity is crucial for cellular integrity, but how tissues adjust proteasome content in response to catabolic stimuli is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional coordination by multiple transcription factors is required to increase proteasome content and activate proteolysis in catabolic states. Using denervated mouse muscle as a model system for accelerated proteolysis in vivo, we reveal that a two-phase transcriptional program activates genes encoding proteasome subunits and assembly chaperones to boost an increase in proteasome content. Initially, gene induction is necessary to maintain basal proteasome levels, and in a more delayed phase (7-10 days after denervation), it stimulates proteasome assembly to meet cellular demand for excessive proteolysis. Intriguingly, the transcription factors PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 control the expression of proteasome among other genes in a combinatorial manner, driving cellular adaptation to muscle denervation. Consequently, PAX4 and α-PALNRF-1 represent new therapeutic targets to inhibit proteolysis in catabolic diseases (e.g., type-2 diabetes, cancer).",['Gilda JE; Nahar A; Kasiviswanathan D; Tropp N; Gilinski T; Lahav T; Alexandrovich D; Mandel-Gutfreund Y; Park S; Shemer S'],2024,"two-phase transcriptional program activates genes encoding proteasome subunits and assembly chaperones to boost proteasome content. a gene induction is necessary to maintain basal proteasome levels. in a more delayed phase, it stimulates proteasome assembly to meet cellular demand for excessive proteolysis."
"Regional and rural-urban patterns in the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension among older U.S. adults with diabetes, 2005-2017.","Hypertension prevalence among the overall US adult population has been relatively stable during the last two decades. However, whether this stabilization has occurred across rural-urban communities and across different geographic regions is unknown, particularly among older adults with diabetes who are likely to have concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. This serial cross-sectional analysis used the 5% national sample of Medicare administrative claims data (n = 3,516,541) to examine temporal trends (2005-2017) in diagnosed hypertension among older adults with diabetes, across urban-rural communities and US census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). Joinpoint regression was used to obtain annual percent change (APC) in hypertension prevalence across rural-urban communities and geographic regions, and multivariable adjusted regression was used to assess associations between rural-urban communities and hypertension prevalence. The APC in the prevalence of hypertension was higher during 2005-2010, and there was a slowdown in the increase during 2011-2017 across all regions, with significant variations across rural-urban communities within each of the regions. In the regression analysis, in the adjusted model, older adults living in non-core (most rural) areas in the Midwest (PR = 0.988, 95% CI: 0.981-0.995) and West (PR = 0.935, 95% CI: 0.923-0.946) had lower hypertension prevalence than their regional counterparts living in large central metro areas. Although the magnitudes of these associations are small, differences in hypertension prevalence across rural-urban areas and geographic regions may have implications for targeted interventions to improve chronic disease prevention and management.",['Uddin J; Zhu S; Malla G; Levitan EB; Rolka DB; Carson AP; Long DL'],2024,hypertension prevalence among the overall adult population has been relatively stable in the last two decades. but whether this stabilization has occurred across rural-urban communities and geographic regions is unknown. older adults with diabetes are likely to have concomitant cardiovascular risk factors.

[Clinicopathological features and prognosis of early-onset gastric cancer: a large-scale retrospective real-world study].,"<b>Objective:</b> To clarify the clinicopathological features, prognosis, and recurrence pattern of early-onset gastric cancer (EOGC). <b>Methods:</b> Using data from the gastric cancer database of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, we performed a retrospective, large-scale, real-world study of 5046 patients with gastric cancer who had undergone redical or palliative gastrectomy from January 2013 to December 2018, including 425 patients with EOGC (age ≤45 years) and 4621 controls. All those patients were pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma with complete follow-up of five years. Residue gastric cancer and patients without complete clinical or follow-up data were excluded. We used a combination of outpatient and telephone follow-up, ending in October 2022 (median duration of follow-up 60 months), and compared the clinicopathological features and prognosis of the two groups. <b>Results:</b> The clinicopathological features of EOGC included female predominance (61.1% [262/425 vs. 26.3% [1217/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=234.215, <i>P</i><0.001), fewer comorbidities (31.3% [133/425] vs. 58.5% [2703/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=34.378, <i>P</i><0.001), poorer differentiation (90.6% [385/425] vs. 78.2% [3614/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=30.642, <i>P</i><0.001), higher proportion of diffuse type (53.9% [229/425] vs. 18.3% [846/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=274.474, <i>P</i><0.001), higher proportion of T4 stage (44.7% [190/425] vs. 37.5% [1733/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=17.535, <i>P</i>=0.001), more lymph node metastases (60.5% [257/425] vs. 53.9% [2491/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=6.764, <i>P</i>=0.009), and higher proportion of pathological stage III/IV (47.5% [202/425] vs. 42.4% [1959/4621], χ<sup>2</sup>=4.093, <i>P</i>=0.043).

Cost-effectiveness of ivosidenib versus chemotherapy for previously treated IDH1-mutant advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Taiwan.,"International guidelines recommend ivosidenib followed by modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) with isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutations. Taiwan National Health Insurance covers only fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) chemotherapy for this ICC group, and there has been no prior economic evaluation of ivosidenib. Therefore, we aimed to assess ivosidenib's cost-effectiveness in previously treated, advanced ICC-presenting IDH1 mutations compared with mFOLFOX or 5-FU/LV. A 3-state partitioned survival model was employed to assess ivosidenib's cost-effectiveness over a 10-year horizon with a 3% discount rate, setting the willingness-to-pay threshold at 3 times the 2022 GDP per capita. Efficacy data for Ivosidenib, mFOLFOX, and 5-FU/LV were sourced from the ClarIDHy, ABC06, and NIFTY trials, respectively. Ivosidenib's cost was assumed to be NT$10,402/500 mg. Primary outcomes included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefit. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were employed to evaluate uncertainty and explore price reduction scenarios. Ivosidenib exhibited ICERs of NT$6,268,528 and NT$5,670,555 compared with mFOLFOX and 5-FU/LV, respectively, both exceeding the established threshold. PSA revealed that ivosidenib was unlikely to be cost-effective, except when it was reduced to NT$4,161 and NT$5,201/500 mg when compared with mFOLFOX and 5-FU/LV, respectively. DSA underscored the significant influence of ivosidenib's cost and utility values on estimate uncertainty. At NT$10,402/500 mg, ivosidenib was not cost-effective for IDH1-mutant ICC patients compared with mFOLFOX or 5-FU/LV, indicating that a 50-60% price reduction is necessary for ivosidenib to be cost-effective in this patient group.",['Chen KA; Huang WM; Chen EY; Ho PK; Chueh CH; Wen YW; Chen MH; Chiang NJ; Tsai YW'],2024,ivosidenib followed by modified FOLFOX (mFOLFOX) for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. there has been no prior economic evaluation of ivosidenib. ivosidenib exhibited ICERs and net monetary benefit.
JinLiDa granules alleviates cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation in diabetic cardiomyopathy by regulating TP53.,"JinLiDa granules (JLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus with Qi and Yin deficiency. Clinical evidence has shown that JLD can alleviate diabetic cardiomyopathy, but the exact mechanism is not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to examine the potential role and mechanism of JLD in the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy through network pharmacological analysis and basic experiments. The targets of JLD associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy were examined by network pharmacology. Protein interaction analysis was performed on the targets, and the associated pathways were searched by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Diabetic mice were treated with low or high doses of JLD by gavage, and AC16 and H9C2 cardiomyocytes exposed to high-glucose conditions were treated with JLD. The analysis results were verified by various experimental techniques to examine molecular mechanisms. Network pharmacological analysis revealed that JLD acted on the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53) during inflammation and fibrosis associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy. The results of basic experiments showed that after JLD treatment, ventricular wall thickening in diabetic mouse hearts was attenuated, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial inflammation were alleviated, and the expression of cardiac hypertrophy- and inflammation-related factors in cardiomyocytes exposed to a high-glucose environment was decreased. Cardiomyocyte morphology also improved after JLD treatment. TP53 expression and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) signaling pathways were significantly altered, and inhibiting TP53 expression effectively alleviated the activation of the TNF and TGFβ1 signaling pathways under high glucose conditions. Overexpression of TP53 activated these signaling pathways. JLD acted on TP53 to regulate the TNF and TGFβ1 signaling pathways, effectively alleviating cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in high glucose and diabetic conditions. Our study provides a solid foundation for the future treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy with JLD.",['Fang T; Wang J; Sun S; Deng X; Xue M; Han F; Sun B; Chen L'],2024,clinical evidence has shown that JLD can alleviate diabetic cardiomyopathy. but the exact mechanism is not yet clear. the target of JLD associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy was examined.
Unveiling the role of the KLF4/Lnc18q22.2/ULBP3 axis in the tumorigenesis and immune escape of hepatocellular carcinoma under hypoxic condition.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a significant global health burden, necessitating an in-depth exploration of its molecular underpinnings to facilitate the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This investigation delves into the complex role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the modulation of hypoxia-induced HCC progression, with a specific emphasis on delineating and functionally characterizing the novel KLF4/Lnc18q22.2/ULBP3 axis. To elucidate the effects of hypoxic conditions on HCC cells, we established in vitro models under both normoxic and hypoxic environments, followed by lncRNA microarray analyses. Among the lncRNAs identified, Lnc18q22.2 was found to be significantly upregulated in HCC cells subjected to hypoxia. Subsequent investigations affirmed the oncogenic role of Lnc18q22.2, highlighting its critical function in augmenting HCC cell proliferation and migration. Further examination disclosed that Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) transcriptionally governs Lnc18q22.2 expression in HCC cells, particularly under hypoxic stress. KLF4 subsequently enhances the tumorigenic capabilities of HCC cells through the modulation of Lnc18q22.2 expression. Advancing downstream in the molecular cascade, our study elucidates a novel interaction between Lnc18q22.2 and UL16-binding protein 3 (ULBP3), culminating in the stabilization of ULBP3 protein expression. Notably, ULBP3 was identified as a pivotal element, exerting dual functions by facilitating HCC tumorigenesis and mitigating immune evasion in hypoxia-exposed HCC cells. The comprehensive insights gained from our research delineate a hitherto unidentified KLF4/Lnc18q22.2/ULBP3 axis integral to the understanding of HCC tumorigenesis and immune escape under hypoxic conditions. This newly unveiled molecular pathway not only enriches our understanding of hypoxia-induced HCC progression but also presents novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.",['Wei L; He P; Tan Z; Zhao L; Lin C; Wei Z'],2024,lncRNAs (lncRNAs) are complex in modulating hypoxia-induced HCC progression. lncRNAs are a novel axis that characterizes the novel KLF4/Lnc18q22.2/ULBP3 axis. lncRNA microarray analyses affirmed the onogenic role of Lnc18q22.2.
Intraretinal Hyper-Reflective Foci Are Almost Universally Present and Co-Localize With Intraretinal Fluid in Diabetic Macular Edema.,"In diabetic macular edema (DME), hyper-reflective foci (HRF) has been linked to disease severity and progression. Using an automated approach, we aimed to investigate the baseline distribution of HRF in DME and their co-localization with cystoid intraretinal fluid (IRF). Baseline spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (N = 1527) from phase III clinical trials YOSEMITE (NCT03622580) and RHINE (NCT03622593) were segmented using a deep-learning-based algorithm (developed using B-scans from BOULEVARD NCT02699450) to detect HRF. The HRF count and volume were assessed. HRF distributions were analyzed in relation to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), and IRF volume in quartiles, and Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scores (DRSS) in groups. Co-localization of HRF with IRF was calculated in the central 3-mm diameter using the en face projection. HRF were present in most patients (up to 99.7%). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) HRF volume within the 3-mm diameter Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ring was 1964.3 (3325.2) pL, and median count was 64.0 (IQR = 96.0). Median HRF volumes were greater with decreasing BCVA (nominal P = 0.0109), and increasing CST (nominal P < 0.0001), IRF (nominal P < 0.0001), and DRSS up to very severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (nominal P < 0.0001). HRF co-localized with IRF in the en face projection. Using automated HRF segmentation of full SD-OCT volumes, we observed that HRF are a ubiquitous feature in DME and exhibit relationships with BCVA, CST, IRF, and DRSS, supporting a potential link to disease severity. The spatial distribution of HRF closely followed that of IRF.",['von Schulthess EL; Maunz A; Chakravarthy U; Holekamp N; Pauleikhoff D; Patel K; Bachmeier I; Yu S; Cohen Y; Scherb MP; Jones IL; Gibson K; Willis JR; Glittenberg C; Singh RP; Fauser S'],2024,"a deep-learning algorithm was developed to detect HRF. the HRF distributions were analyzed in relation to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST) and IRF volume in quartiles."
CT-derived skeletal muscle change before immunotherapy predicts survival of advanced gastric cancer: associations with inflammatory markers and liver lipid metabolism.,"Skeletal muscle (SM) is a key factor in cancer treatment. However, it is unclear whether pretreatment SM change affects the outcome of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapy in gastric cancer (GC). Advanced GCs treated with ICIs were retrospectively investigated. SM evaluated by psoas muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra was measured on CT acquired within 1 month from the start of ICIs therapy (CT-1), and on CT acquired 2.8 ± 0.84 months before CT-1. Monthly change rate of SM (MCR-SM) was defined as the change rate of SMs between those two CTs divided by the period between those CTs (month). Monthly change rate of body weight (MCR-BW) during the same period was also calculated. They were compared with disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free survival (PFS). MCR-SM was compared with pretreatment markers including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver-to-spleen CT attenuation ratio (LSR) as a marker of liver lipid metabolism. This study enrolled eighty-three GC patients. MCR-SM significantly correlated with DSS and PFS (P < 0.0001, 0.001, respectively), whereas MCR-BW did not. Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated that higher MCR-SM (MCR-SM ≥ -0.7185%) significantly associated with better DSS and PFS (P = 0.0002, 0.03, respectively). Patients with positive MCR-SM showed significantly lower NLR, MLR, and CRP than those with negative (P = 0.01, 0.006, 0.003, respectively).

ASSOCIATION OF MACULAR STRUCTURE WITH MICROPERIMETRY SENSITIVITY FOLLOWING VITRECTOMY FOR PROLIFERATE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY.,"To evaluate macular sensitivity using microperimetry in patients with proliferate diabetic retinopathy following vitrectomy and to investigate the relationship between the sensitivity and foveal microstructures with optical coherence tomography/angiography. Eighty-four eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, who were indicated for vitrectomy, had no intraocular surgery history 3 months preoperatively, and were able to ensure fundus examination after the vitrectomy, were included. A logMAR best-corrected visual acuity, macular sensitivity of microperimetry, macular retinal thickness, and macular vessel perfusion using optical coherence tomography/angiography were examined at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months postoperatively. The logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy improved postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between best-corrected visual acuity and mean sensitivity (P < 0.05). Postoperative mean macular sensitivity was significantly correlated with outer retinal thickness in the 0 to 6 mm macular area (P < 0.05) and also significantly correlated with deep capillary plexus perfusion (P < 0.05). Fixation stability and mean macular sensitivity did not show any correlation with glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, serum total cholesterol, carbamide, and creatinine and duration of diabetes mellitus (P > 0.05).

The authors found that the visual performance of patients can be evaluated by the outer retinal thickness and deep capillary plexus perfusion, so optical coherence tomography/angiography examination can be an important prognostic factor for visual performance in patients.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn; Registration No.: ChiCTR2100043399).",['Wang M; Shao Y; Gong Y; Liu B; Liu J; Luan R; Ma M; Li X'],2024,"84 eyes of 84 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were indicated for vitrectomy. sensitivity of microperimetry, retinal thickness, and vessel perfusion improved postoperatively. logMAR best-corrected visual acuity and mean macular sensitivity improved postoperatively."
Smoking cessation counselling patterns in cancer patients - survey of Lebanese physicians.,"Tobacco smoking is a known risk factor for cancer development and smoking cessation can lower this risk and improve outcomes in some cancer patients. Despite that, many cancer patients do not quit smoking after a cancer diagnosis, and smoking cessation counselling is still not routinely provided in cancer care. The aim of this study is to examine patterns in smoking cessation counselling to cancer patients by their treating physicians. A self-administered, web-based (mobile-friendly), anonymous questionnaire was developed on LimeSurvey and sent by e-mail to Lebanese physicians of different specialties between June 2020 and January 2022. Data were analysed using SPSS and associations between the different items were determined using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. A total of 146 physicians filled out the questionnaire. Almost all physicians ask cancer patients about their smoking status, but only 45.9% provide smoking cessation counselling, and only 24% refer patients to smoking cessation counselling programs. Only 27.4% of all respondents have received formal smoking cessation training, and only 27.4% feel capable of providing smoking cessation counselling in their clinic. Specifically, family medicine physicians were more likely to provide smoking cessation counselling in the clinic (69%), more likely to refer patients to a smoking cessation counselling program (44%), and more likely to have received formal smoking cessation counselling training (67%) and more likely to feel capable of providing smoking cessation counselling (93%). Lack of training, lack of knowledge of available programs and the lack of availability of enough programs are leading obstacles contributing to low rates of smoking cessation counselling in cancer patients as reported by the physicians. Our data reveals a deficiency in smoking cessation counselling and referral of cancer patients to smoking cessation counselling programs in our region.

This study aims to determine the rate of complications and the related factors associated with complications following laparoscopic sphincter-preserving total mesorectal excision for low rectal cancer. This retrospective study was conducted at the University Medical Center of Ho Chi Minh City from March 2022 to March 2023. It included patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with low rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic sphincter-preserving total mesorectal excision. Data on patient demographics, surgical details, and postoperative complications were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Follow-ups were conducted up to six months after surgery. Of the 83 patients included, the postoperative complications rate was 14.5%. The complications observed included surgical wound infections (five cases), anastomotic leaks (five cases, including three recto-vaginal fistulas and two pelvic abscesses), urinary retention (one case), and pneumonia (one case). A significant finding was the higher rate of distant metastases in patients with complications compared to those without (p=0.033). Laparoscopic sphincter-preserving total mesorectal excision for low rectal cancer is safe and effective, with a high success rate and low complication rate during or after surgery. Anastomotic leakage remains the most significant complication. Despite advancements in surgery, modern suturing tools, and preoperative patient optimization, complications are avoidable. Therefore, understanding the related factors and implementing preventive interventions is crucial.",['Huu Phu L; Tat Bang H; Van Viet U; Danh Tan H; Tin NT'],2024,laparoscopic sphincter-preserving total mesorectal excision is safe and effective. the sphincter-preserving total mesorectal excision is safer and effective.
Cardiac magnetic resonance reveals biventricular impairment in Cushing's syndrome: a multicentre case-control study.,"Cushing's syndrome (CS) is associated with severe cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the non-invasive gold standard for assessing cardiac structure and function; however, few CMR studies explore cardiac remodeling in patients exposed to chronic glucocorticoid (GC) excess. We aimed to describe the CMR features directly attributable to previous GC exposure in patients with cured or treated endogenous CS. This was a prospective, multicentre, case-control study enrolling consecutive patients with cured or treated CS and patients harboring non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas (NFAI), comparable in terms of sex, age, CV risk factors, and BMI. All patients were in stable condition and had a minimum 24-month follow-up. Sixteen patients with CS and 15 NFAI were enrolled. Indexed left ventricle (LV) end-systolic volume and LV mass were higher in patients with CS (p = 0.027; p = 0.013); similarly, indexed right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were higher in patients with CS compared to NFAI (p = 0.035; p = 0.006). Morphological alterations also affected cardiac function, as LV and RV ejection fractions decreased in patients with CS (p = 0.056; p = 0.044). CMR features were independent of metabolic status or other CV risk factors, with fasting glucose significantly lower in CS remission than NFAI (p < 0.001) and no differences in lipid levels or blood pressure. CS is associated with biventricular cardiac structural and functional impairment at CMR, likely attributable to chronic exposure to cortisol excess independently of known traditional risk factors.",['Feola T; Cozzolino A; De Alcubierre D; Pofi R; Galea N; Catalano C; Simeoli C; Di Paola N; Campolo F; Pivonello R; Isidori AM; Giannetta E'],2024,CS is associated with severe cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. a study enrolled patients with cured or treated endogenous CS. a study aimed to describe the CMR features directly attributable to previous GC exposure in patients with cured or treated CS.
SOX11 is a novel binding partner and endogenous inhibitor of SAMHD1 ara-CTPase activity in mantle cell lymphoma.,"The sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate (HD) domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase with ara-CTPase activity that confers cytarabine (ara-C) resistance in several haematological malignancies. Targeting SAMHD1's ara-CTPase activity has recently been demonstrated to enhance ara-C efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we identify the transcription factor SRY-related HMG-box containing protein 11 (SOX11) as a novel direct binding partner and first known endogenous inhibitor of SAMHD1. SOX11 is aberrantly expressed not only in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but also in some Burkitt lymphomas. Co-immunoprecipitation of SOX11 followed by mass spectrometry in MCL cell lines identified SAMHD1 as the top SOX11 interaction partner which was validated by proximity ligation assay. <i>In vitro</i>, SAMHD1 bound to the HMG box of SOX11 with low-micromolar affinity. <i>In situ</i> crosslinking studies further indicated that SOX11-SAMHD1 binding resulted in a reduced tetramerization of SAMHD1. Functionally, expression of SOX11 inhibited SAMHD1 ara-CTPase activity in a dose-dependent manner resulting in ara-C sensitization in cell lines and in a SOX11-inducible mouse model of MCL. In SOX11-negative MCL, SOX11-mediated ara-CTPase inhibition could be mimicked by adding the recently identified SAMHD1 inhibitor hydroxyurea. Taken together, our results identify SOX11 as a novel SAMHD1 interaction partner and its first known endogenous inhibitor with potentially important implications for clinical therapy stratification.",['Morsy MHA; Lilienthal I; Lord M; Merrien M; Wasik AM; Sureda-Gómez M; Amador V; Johansson HJ; Lehtiö J; Garcia-Torre B; Martin-Subero JI; Tsesmetzis N; Tao S; Schinazi RF; Kim B; Sorteberg AL; Wickström M; Sheppard D; Rassidakis GZ; Taylor IA; Christensson B; Campo E; Herold N; Sander B'],2024,sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase with ara-CTPase activity. ara-CTPase activity confers ara-C resistance in several haematological malignancies.
Double-faced CX3CL1 enhances lymphangiogenesis-dependent metastasis in an aggressive subclone of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Because cancer cells have a genetically unstable nature, they give rise to genetically different variant subclones inside a single tumor. Understanding cancer heterogeneity and subclone characteristics is crucial for developing more efficacious therapies. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is characterized by high heterogeneity and plasticity. On the other hand, CX3C motif ligand 1 (CX3CL1) is a double-faced chemokine with anti- and pro-tumor functions. Our study reported that CX3CL1 functioned differently in tumors with different cancer phenotypes, both in vivo and in vitro. Mouse OSCC 1 (MOC1) and MOC2 cells responded similarly to CX3CL1 in vitro. However, in vivo, CX3CL1 increased keratinization in indolent MOC1 cancer, while CX3CL1 promoted cervical lymphatic metastasis in aggressive MOC2 cancer. These outcomes were due to double-faced CX3CL1 effects on different immune microenvironments indolent and aggressive cancer created. Furthermore, we established that CX3CL1 promoted cancer metastasis via the lymphatic pathway by stimulating lymphangiogenesis and transendothelial migration of lymph-circulating tumor cells. CX3CL1 enrichment in lymphatic metastasis tissues was observed in aggressive murine and human cell lines. OSCC patient samples with CX3CL1 enrichment exhibited a strong correlation with lower overall survival rates and higher recurrence and distant metastasis rates. In conclusion, CX3CL1 is a pivotal factor that stimulates the metastasis of aggressive cancer subclones within the heterogeneous tumors to metastasize, and our study demonstrates the prognostic value of CX3CL1 enrichment in long-term monitoring in OSCC.",['Eain HS; Kawai H; Nakayama M; Oo MW; Ohara T; Fukuhara Y; Takabatake K; Shan Q; Soe Y; Ono K; Nakano K; Mizukawa N; Iida S; Nagatsuka H'],2024,"cancer cells have a genetically unstable nature, giving rise to genetically different variant subclones inside a single tumor. a study found that CX3CL1 functioned differently in tumors with different cancer phenotypes, both in vivo and in vitro."
"The prognostic effect of tumor volume, reduction ratio, and cumulative doses on external beam radiotherapy with central-shielding method and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy for cervical cancer.","To evaluate the prognostic effect of tumor volume at diagnosis, tumor reduction ratio during external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with central-shielding method, and cumulative minimal dose to 90% of the high-risk clinical target volume (CTV<sub>HR</sub> D<sub>90</sub>) on combined EBRT and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) for cervical cancer. Consecutive patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer at Gunma University Hospital between January 2010 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor volume at diagnosis and reduction ratio were calculated using magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis and before the first IGABT session. The cumulative dose of EBRT and IGABT was calculated as an equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2). Optimal cutoff values were determined according to a receiver operating characteristic curve. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 254 patients were included in the analysis. The median follow-up for all patients was 57 (2-134) months. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 81.9%, progression-free survival (PFS) was 71.3%, and local control (LC) was 94.5%. The patients were divided into four groups according to tumor volume at diagnosis and reduction ratio. The group with tumor volume at diagnosis ≥ 34.1 cm<sup>3</sup> and reduction ratio < 68.8% showed significantly worse OS, PFS, and LC than the other three groups (All <i>p</i> < 0.05). In this group, the patients with a cumulative CTV<sub>HR</sub> D<sub>90</sub> < 69.6 Gy<sub>EQD2</sub> showed significantly worse PFS and LC (<i>p</i> = 0.042 and <i>p</i> = 0.027, respectively).

The 5-item modified frailty index as a predictor of postoperative outcomes in thoracic metastatic epidural spinal cord compression.,"Patients with thoracic metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) often undergo extensive surgical decompression to avoid functional decline. Though limited in scope, scales including the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) are used to stratify surgical risk to predict perioperative morbidity. This study uses the 5-item modified frailty index (mFI-5) to predict outcomes following transpedicular decompression/fusion for high-grade MESCC. A retrospective chart review was conducted on patients who underwent transpedicular decompression and fusion for MESCC (baseline demographics, spinal instability neoplastic score, preoperative and postoperative Bilsky scores, primary cancer type, RCRI). Primary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), intraoperative estimated blood loss, readmission/reoperation within 90 days of index surgery, 90-day mortality, and post-hospitalization disposition. 127 patients were included in our study. 90% of patients' lesions were Bilsky 2 or greater. Increasing frailty, measured by mFI-5, was a significant predictor of increased LOS (p<0.01) and 90-day mortality (p<0.05). Multivariate analysis adjusting for sex, BMI, and age still showed statistical significance (p<0.05). MFI-5 was not a significant predictor of readmission/reoperation within 90 days or estimated blood loss. Age - not mFI-5 or RCRI - was a significant predictor for posthospitalization non-home disposition (p=0.001). The mFI-5 can serve as a useful predictor of outcomes after transpedicular decompression and fusion for thoracic MESCC as it can account for the patient's frailty. Our study demonstrated the mFI-5 as a predictor of LOS and 90-day mortality. These results provide a background to both understanding and integrating frailty into decision-making in MESCC.",['Mauria R; Kumar P; Yaffe NM; Labak CM; Herring EZ; Azghadi A; Kasliwal MK'],2024,thoracic metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) often undergo extensive surgical decompression to avoid functional decline. scales including the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) are used to stratify surgical risk to predict perioperative morbidity. 127 patients were included in our study. 90% of patients' lesions were Bilsky 2 or greater.

Preserved seasonal variation in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during COVID-19: a 3-year-long retrospective cohort study in older adults in Japan.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed our lifestyle by imposing restrictions, such as physical distancing. The effect of COVID-19 prevalence on seasonal variations in glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) remains unknown. This single-center retrospective cohort study evaluated glycemic control in patients with type 2 DM who visited Sugi Cardiovascular Hospital in December 2021. We evaluated the clinical findings of all patients treated regularly between March 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021, including the periods both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. All the standard treatments were approved. Furthermore, seasonal changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were evaluated using stratified analyses based on age. This study analyzed 86 patients (mean age, 69.6 ± 9.2 years; men, 57). Median HbA1c (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program [Union of Clinical Chemistry]) levels in spring (March) were 7.70% (interquartile range (IQR):7.23%-8.30%) [60.6 mmol/mol (IQR:55.4-67.2 mmol/mol)], 7.35% (IQR:6.90%-7.90%) [56.8 mmol/mol (IQR:51.9-62.8 mmol/mol)], and 7.50% (IQR:7.10%-8.00%) [58.5 mmol/mol (IQR:54.1-63.9 mmol/mol)] in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. During these periods, HbA1c levels and body mass index (BMI) revealed significant seasonal variations ""high in spring"" and ""low in autumn."" Median HbA1c levels in spring (March) and autumn (September) were 7.86% [61.2 mmol/mol] and 7.48% [57.4 mmol/mol] in 2019 (P < 0.001), 7.50% [57.7 mmol/mol] and 7.17% [54.2 mmol/mol] in 2020 (P < 0.001), and 7.61% [58.3 mmol/mol] and 7.19% [53.8 mmol/mol] in 2021 (P < 0.001). Seasonal variations in HbA1c levels and BMI were maintained over the past 3 years, including the pandemic period. None of the patients in this study developed COVID-19 during the study period. Seasonal variations in glycemic control in patients with DM were not influenced by lifestyle modifications associated with COVID-19.

Design and evaluation of a multi-epitope DNA vaccine against HPV16.,"Cervical cancer, among the deadliest cancers affecting women globally, primarily arises from persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). To effectively combat persistent infection and prevent the progression of precancerous lesions into malignancy, a therapeutic HPV vaccine is under development. This study utilized an immunoinformatics approach to predict epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) using the E6 and E7 oncoproteins of the HPV16 strain as target antigens. Subsequently, through meticulous selection of T-cell epitopes and other necessary elements, a multi-epitope vaccine was constructed, exhibiting good immunogenic, physicochemical, and structural characteristics. Furthermore, in silico simulations showed that the vaccine not only interacted well with toll-like receptors (TLR2/TLR3/TLR4), but also induced a strong innate and adaptive immune response characterized by elevated Th1-type cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-2 (IL2). Additionally, our study investigated the effects of different immunization intervals on immune responses, aiming to optimize a time-efficient immunization program. In animal model experiments, the vaccine exhibited robust immunogenic, therapeutic, and prophylactic effects. Administered thrice, it consistently induced the expansion of specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, resulting in substantial cytokines release and increased proliferation of memory T cell subsets in splenic cells. Overall, our findings support the potential of this multi-epitope vaccine in combating HPV16 infection and signify its candidacy for future HPV vaccine development.",['Zhu L; Cui X; Yan Z; Tao Y; Shi L; Zhang X; Yao Y; Shi L'],2024,"a therapeutic HPV vaccine is under development to combat persistent infection. the vaccine exhibited good immunogenic, therapeutic, and prophylactic characteristics. it also induced a strong immune response characterized by elevated Th1-type cytokines."
Venous thromboembolism in adrenocortical carcinoma: a retrospective analysis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of death in patients with cancer. Limited data exist about VTE in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). The primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of VTE in a cohort of patients with ACC. Secondary objectives were to determine the impact of VTE events on overall survival (OS) and to describe the characteristics of VTE in patients with ACC. We retrospectively reviewed data from 289 patients with ACC cared for at a major referral center from February 2010 to June 2022. VTE prevalence was 18.7% (54 events). Thirty patients (55.6%) had pulmonary embolism (PE); 12 patients (22.2%) had deep vein thrombosis (DVT); and 12 patients (22.2%) had both PE and DVT. VTE occurred after ACC diagnosis in 50 patients (92.6%) including 44 patients (88%) with stage 3 or 4 ACC. VTEs were CTCAE grade ≤2 in 32 cases (59.3%), grade 3 in 17 (31.5%), and grade 4 in 2 (3.7%). Thirteen patients (24%) died within 6 months after VTE diagnosis, although there was no statistically significant association between VTE and overall survival. Despite the potential to underestimate the prevalence of VTEs, we found a high frequency of VTE events in patients with ACC. A majority of VTEs occurred in the context of advanced ACC and we observed high short-term mortality. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and investigate mechanisms associated with VTE in ACC.",['Laganà M; Balderrama-Brondani V; Herrera KR; Chahla B; Yaylaci F; Bassett RL; Jimenez C; Varghese J; Waguespack SG; Campbell MT; Shah AY; Rojas Hernandez CM; Habra MA'],2024,limited data exist about VTE in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) the primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of VTE in a cohort of patients with ACC.

From metabolism to malignancy: the multifaceted role of PGC1α in cancer.,"PGC1α, a central player in mitochondrial biology, holds a complex role in the metabolic shifts seen in cancer cells. While its dysregulation is common across major cancers, its impact varies. In some cases, downregulation promotes aerobic glycolysis and progression, whereas in others, overexpression escalates respiration and aggression. PGC1α's interactions with distinct signaling pathways and transcription factors further diversify its roles, often in a tissue-specific manner. Understanding these multifaceted functions could unlock innovative therapeutic strategies. However, challenges exist in managing the metabolic adaptability of cancer cells and refining PGC1α-targeted approaches. This review aims to collate and present the current knowledge on the expression patterns, regulators, binding partners, and roles of PGC1α in diverse cancers. We examined PGC1α's tissue-specific functions and elucidated its dual nature as both a potential tumor suppressor and an oncogenic collaborator. In cancers where PGC1α is tumor-suppressive, reinstating its levels could halt cell proliferation and invasion, and make the cells more receptive to chemotherapy. In cancers where the opposite is true, halting PGC1α's upregulation can be beneficial as it promotes oxidative phosphorylation, allows cancer cells to adapt to stress, and promotes a more aggressive cancer phenotype. Thus, to target PGC1α effectively, understanding its nuanced role in each cancer subtype is indispensable. This can pave the way for significant strides in the field of oncology.",['Wang Y; Peng J; Yang D; Xing Z; Jiang B; Ding X; Jiang C; Ouyang B; Su L'],2024,"mitochondrial biology plays a role in the metabolic shifts seen in cancer cells. dysregulation promotes aerobic glycolysis and progression. in some cases, overexpression escalates respiration and aggression."

For this substudy, we enrolled 23 patients with IDFU. Patients were treated with boluses of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid(AMC)(12patients) or ceftazidime(CTZ)(11patients). After induction of a steady ATB state, microdialysis was performed near the IDFU. Tissue fluid samples from the foot and blood samples from peripheral blood were taken within 6 hours. ATB <i>potential</i> efficacy was <i>assessed by evaluating</i> the maximum serum and tissue ATB concentrations(C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>max-tissue</sub>)and the percentage of time the unbound drug tissue concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(≥100% <sub>tissue</sub> and ≥50%/60% <sub>tissue</sub> fT>MIC). Vascular status was assessed by triplex ultrasound, ankle-brachial and toe-brachial index tests, occlusive plethysmography comprising two arterial flow phases, and transcutaneous oxygen pressure(TcPO<sub>2</sub>). Following bolus administration, the C<sub>max</sub> of AMC was 91.8 ± 52.5 μgmL<sup>-1</sup> and the C<sub>max-tissue</sub> of AMC was 7.25 ± 4.5 μgmL<sup>-1</sup>(<i>P</i><0.001).

Comparison of Multiparametric MRI and the Combination of PSMA Plus MRI for the Intraprostatic Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and the combination of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET plus MRI (PSMA + MRI) for detecting intraprostatic clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Relevant databases were searched through November 2023. Only studies directly comparing mpMRI and PSMA + MRI (PET/MRI or PET/CT + mpMRI) were included. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve for each approach. A total of 19 studies were included. On a patient-level analysis, PSMA + MRI had higher sensitivity (9 studies) than mpMRI for csPCa detection (96% [95% confidence interval (CI): 92%, 98%] vs 89% [95% CI: 81%, 94%]; P = 0.04). The patient-level specificity (4 studies) of PSMA + MRI was 55% (95% CI: 31%-76%) compared with 50% (95% CI: 44%-57%) of mpMRI (P = 0.67). Region-level sensitivity (10 studies) was 85% (95% CI: 74%-92%) for PSMA + MRI and 71% (95% CI: 58%-82%) for mpMRI (P = 0.09), whereas specificity (4 studies) was 87% (95% CI: 76%-94%) and 90% (95% CI: 82%-95%), respectively (P = 0.59). Lesion-level sensitivity and specificity were similar between modalities with pooled data from less than 4 studies. PSMA + MRI had superior pooled sensitivity and similar specificity for the detection of csPCa compared with mpMRI in this meta-analysis of head-to-head studies.",['Brondani Torri G; Antune Pereira P; Piovesan Wiethan C; Mesquita Y; Mirshahvalad SA; Veit-Haibach P; Ghai S; Metser U; Altmayer S; Dias AB'],2024,mpMRI and PSMA + MRI were compared to mpMRI. sensitivity was higher than mpMRI for csPCa detection.
Low Concentration of Lipoprotein(a) is an Independent Predictor of Incident Type 2 Diabetes.,"The aim of the study was to assess the association between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration and incident type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis of qualified studies on the relationship of low levels of Lp(a) concentration with incident type 2 diabetes was conducted. PubMed and Cochrane libraries were searched for randomized controlled trials containing data on events. Seven randomized trials with 227178 subjects were included in this analysis. We found an inverse association of the levels of Lp(a) concentration with risk of type 2 diabetes with approximately 37% lower relative risk in the group with the highest concentration compared with group with the lowest concentration. The current available evidence from prospective studies suggests that there is an inverse association between the levels of Lp(a) concentration and risk of type 2 diabetes, with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes at low levels of Lp(a) concentration. Therefore, we believe that the low levels of Lp(a) concentration is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes.",['Liu W; Zhang G; Nie Z; Guan X; Sun T; Jin X; Li B'],2024,the aim of the study was to assess the association between lipoprotein(a) concentration and incident type 2 diabetes. the low levels of Lp(a) concentration is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes.
Sodium-glucose co-transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for people with chronic kidney disease and diabetes.,"Diabetes is associated with high risks of premature chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular diseases, cardiovascular death and impaired quality of life. People with diabetes are more likely to develop kidney impairment, and approximately one in three adults with diabetes have CKD. People with CKD and diabetes experience a substantially higher risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Sodium-glucose co-transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown potential effects in preventing kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in people with CKD and diabetes. However, new trials are emerging rapidly, and evidence synthesis is essential to summarising cumulative evidence. This review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of SGLT2 inhibitors for people with CKD and diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 17 November 2023 using a search strategy designed by an Information Specialist. Studies in the Register are continually identified through regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled studies were eligible if they evaluated SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo, standard care or other glucose-lowering agents in people with CKD and diabetes. CKD includes all stages (from 1 to 5), including dialysis patients. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the study risk of bias. Treatment estimates were summarised using random effects meta-analysis and expressed as a risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD), with a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The primary review outcomes were all-cause death, 3-point and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, and kidney failure. Fifty-three studies randomising 65,241 people with CKD and diabetes were included. SGLT2 inhibitors with or without other background treatments were compared to placebo, standard care, sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or insulin. In the majority of domains, the risks of bias in the included studies were low or unclear. No studies evaluated the treatment in children or in people treated with dialysis. No studies compared SGLT2 inhibitors with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or tirzepatide. Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors decreased the risk of all-cause death (20 studies, 44,397 participants: RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.94; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; high certainty) and cardiovascular death (16 studies, 43,792 participants: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93; I<sup>2</sup> = 29%; high certainty). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors probably make little or no difference to the risk of fatal or nonfatal MI (2 studies, 13,726 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.14; I<sup>2</sup> = 24%; moderate certainty), and fatal or nonfatal stroke (2 studies, 13,726 participants: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; moderate certainty). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors probably decrease 3-point MACE (7 studies, 38,320 participants: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98; I<sup>2</sup> = 46%; moderate certainty), and 4-point MACE (4 studies, 23,539 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96; I<sup>2</sup> = 77%; moderate certainty), and decrease hospital admission due to heart failure (6 studies, 28,339 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.79; I<sup>2</sup> = 17%; high certainty). Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors may decrease creatinine clearance (1 study, 132 participants: MD -2.63 mL/min, 95% CI -5.19 to -0.07; low certainty) and probably decrease the doubling of serum creatinine (2 studies, 12,647 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89; I<sup>2</sup> = 53%; moderate certainty). SGLT2 inhibitors decrease the risk of kidney failure (6 studies, 11,232 participants: RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.79; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; high certainty), and kidney composite outcomes (generally reported as kidney failure, kidney death with or without ≥ 40% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) (7 studies, 36,380 participants: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.78; I<sup>2</sup> = 25%; high certainty) compared to placebo. Compared to placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors incur less hypoglycaemia (16 studies, 28,322 participants: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; high certainty), and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance (14 studies, 26,478 participants: RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; high certainty), and probably decrease the withdrawal from treatment due to adverse events (15 studies, 16,622 participants: RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08; I<sup>2</sup> = 16%; moderate certainty). The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on eGFR, amputation and fracture were uncertain. No studies evaluated the effects of treatment on fatigue, life participation, or lactic acidosis. The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors compared to standard care alone, sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors, or insulin were uncertain. SGLT2 inhibitors alone or added to standard care decrease all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and kidney failure and probably decrease major cardiovascular events while incurring less hypoglycaemia compared to placebo in people with CKD and diabetes.",['Natale P; Tunnicliffe DJ; Toyama T; Palmer SC; Saglimbene VM; Ruospo M; Gargano L; Stallone G; Gesualdo L; Strippoli GF'],2024,people with CKD and diabetes experience a substantially higher risk of kidney impairment. saturday's study was conducted on the cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register.
Cross-Sectional and Prospective Association of Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D with Gut Mycobiota during Pregnancy among Women with Gestational Diabetes.,"Little is known about the effect of blood vitamin D status on the gut mycobiota (i.e., fungi), a crucial component of the gut microbial ecosystem. The study aims to explore the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and gut mycobiota and to investigate the link between the identified mycobial features and blood glycemic traits. The study examines the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and the gut mycobiota in the Westlake Precision Birth Cohort, which includes pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The study develops a genetic risk score (GRS) for 25(OH)D to validate the observational results. In both the prospective and cross-sectional analyses, the vitamin D is associated with gut mycobiota diversity. Specifically, the abundance of Saccharomyces is significantly lower in the vitamin D-sufficient group than in the vitamin D-deficient group. The GRS of 25(OH)D is inversely associated with the abundance of Saccharomyces. Moreover, the Saccharomyces is positively associated with blood glucose levels. Blood vitamin D status is associated with the diversity and composition of gut mycobiota in women with GDM, which may provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding of the relationship between vitamin D levels and metabolic health.",['Liang Y; Jiang Z; Fu Y; Lu S; Miao Z; Shuai M; Liang X; Gou W; Zhang K; Shi RQ; Gao C; Shi MQ; Wang XH; Hu WS; Zheng JS'],2024,study aims to explore association between serum 25(OH)D levels and gut mycobiota. study examines link between serum 25(OH)D levels and gut mycobiota. abundance of Saccharomyces significantly lower in vitamin D-sufficient group.
Silencing of circRPPH1 Inhibits the Progression of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Through miR-326/ERBB4 Signal Axis.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play critical roles in the recurrence and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to investigate the function and underlying mechanism of a novel circRNA (circRPPH1) in NSCLC. Localization of circRPPH1 was determined via FISH assay, while cell proliferation was assessed via CCK8 and colony formation assay. Cell migration and invasion were studied using transwell assay, while binding sites between miR-326 and circRPPH1 or ERBB4 were verified by luciferase reporter, RIP, and RNA pull-down assays. Moreover, xenograft assay was performed to verify the in vivo roles of circRPPH1. Results indicated that circRPPH1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cells, where circRPPH1 levels were predictive of poor prognosis. The malignant behavior of NSCLC cells was exacerbated by overexpressing circRPPH1, while opposite effects were observed when it was knocked down. Direct interaction between miR-326 and circRPPH1 or ERBB4 was confirmed in NSCLC cells, while rescue experiment results showed that circRPPH1 exerted an oncogenic role via miR-326-ERBB4 signal axis. Moreover, in vitro, growth of NSCLC cells was significantly attenuated following circRPPH1 depletion. The study concluded that circRPPH1 was involved in promoting NSCLC progression via the miR-326/ERBB4 axis, which provided a novel potential target for the diagnosis or treatment of NSCLC.",['Bao J; Zhou Q; Tai P; Yuan Z; Liu C'],2024,circRNAs play critical roles in recurrence and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer. circRNAs play critical roles in the recurrence and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer.
"Clinical presentation, antimicrobial resistance, and treatment outcomes of Aeromonas human infections: A 14-year retrospective study and comparative genomics of two isolates from fatal cases.","Aeromonas virulence may not be entirely dependent on the host immune status. Pathophysiologic determinants of disease progression and severity remain unclear. One hundred five patients with Aeromonas infections and 112 isolates were identified, their clinical presentations and outcomes analyzed, and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns assessed. Two isolates (A and B) from fatal cases of Aeromonas dhakensis bacteremia were characterized using whole genome sequence analysis. Virulence factor- and AMR-encoding genes from these isolates were compared with a well-characterized diarrheal isolate A. dhakensis SSU, and environmental isolate A. hydrophila ATCC_7966T. Skin and soft tissue infections, traumatic wound infections, sepsis, burns, and intraabdominal infections were common. Diabetes, malignancy, and cirrhosis were frequent comorbidities. Male sex, age ≥ 65 years, hospitalization, burns, and intensive care were associated with complicated disease. High rates of AMR to carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were found. Treatment failure was observed in 25.7% of cases. Septic shock and hospital-acquired infections were predictors of treatment failure. All four isolates harbored assorted broad-spectrum AMR genes including blaOXA, ampC, cphA, and efflux pumps. Only clinical isolates possessed both polar and lateral flagellar genes, genes for various surface adhesion proteins, type 3- and -6 secretion systems and their effectors, and toxin genes, including exotoxin A. Both isolates A and B were resistant to colistin and harbored the mobile colistin resistance-3 (mcr-3) gene. Empirical therapy tailored to local Aeromonas antibiograms may facilitate more favorable outcomes, while advanced diagnostic methods may aid in identifying correct Aeromonas spp. of significant clinical importance.",['Pineda-Reyes R; Neil BH; Orndorff J; Williams-Bouyer N; Netherland M; Hasan NA; Tahashilder MI; Sha J; Chopra AK; Reynoso D'],2024,"isolates from fatal cases of Aeromonas dhakensis bacteremia were characterized. a total of 112 isolates were identified, clinical presentations and outcomes analyzed. a total of 125 patients were identified and 112 isolates were identified."
How to improve ChatGPT performance for nephrologists: a technique guide.,"The integration of ChatGPT into nephrology presents opportunities for enhanced decision-making and patient care. However, refining its performance to meet the specific needs of nephrologists remains a challenge. This guide offers a strategic roadmap for advancing ChatGPT's effectiveness in nephrological applications. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of GPT-4, we customized user profiles to optimize the model's response quality for nephrological inquiries. We assessed the efficacy of chain-of-thought prompting versus standard prompting in delineating the diagnostic pathway for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus-associated hypernatremia and polyuria. Additionally, we explored the influence of integrating retrieval-augmented generation on the model's proficiency in detailing pharmacological interventions to decelerate the progression from chronic kidney disease (CKD) G3 to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), comparing it to responses without retrieval-augmented generation. In contrast to the standard prompting, the chain-of-thought method offers a step-by-step diagnostic process that mirrors the intricate thought processes needed for diagnosing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus-related hypernatremia and polyuria. This begins with an initial assessment, notably including a water deprivation test. After evaluating the outcomes of this test, the approach continues by identifying potential causes. Furthermore, if a patient's history suggests lithium usage, the chain-of-thought model adjusts by proposing a more customized course of action. In response to ""List medication treatment to help slow progression of CKD G3 to ESKD?"", GPT-4 only provides a general summary of medication options. Nevertheless, a specialized GPT-4 model equipped with a retrieval-augmented generation system delivers more precise responses, including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This aligns well with the 2024 KDIGO guidelines. GPT-4, when integrated with chain-of-thought prompting and retrieval-augmented generation techniques, demonstrates enhanced performance in the nephrology domain. This guide underscores the transformative potential of chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation techniques in optimizing ChatGPT for nephrology, and highlights the ongoing need for innovative, tailored AI solutions in specialized medical fields.",['Miao J; Thongprayoon C; Craici IM; Cheungpasitporn W'],2024,nephrologists can use the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 to improve response quality. we customized user profiles to optimize the model's response quality. the chain-of-thought method offers a step-by-step diagnostic process.
Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Different Second-line Therapies for Patients With Advanced Thymic Carcinoma.,"Thymic carcinoma (TC) is a rare form of highly invasive tumors. Currently, the standard first-line therapy involves paclitaxel plus carboplatin treatment, while the recommended regimen for second-line therapy remains uncertain. The purpose of this study is to explore the second-line mode of TC patients. We evaluated the outcome of subjects with advanced TC between 2009 and 2023 in three medical centers, retrospectively. Tumor response was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Kaplan-Meier was used for calculating Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The factors affecting survival in the real world were evaluated by Cox analysis. Totally 136 patients were included in this study, the median PFS (mPFS) for all subjects was 5.97 months, and the median OS (mOS) was 25.03 months. According to patient's treatment modes, they are divided into monotherapy (n = 95) and combination therapy (n = 41), PFS manifested the difference between two groups (5.17 vs. 9.00 months, P = 0.043). OS also indicated a significant distinction (22.50 vs. 38.00 months, P = 0.017). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in PFS between patients using immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy and those with antivascular therapy (8.57 vs. 13.10 months, P = 0.047). In the second-line therapy for advanced TC, the efficacy of combination therapy was better than monotherapy, especially for immunotherapy combined with antivascular therapy.",['Shao K; Hao Y; Xu M; Shi Z; Lin G; Xu C; Zhang Y; Song Z'],2024,TC patients are treated with paclitaxel plus carboplatin. the recommended regimen for second-line therapy remains uncertain. the results of the study were evaluated retrospectively.
Serum levels of stem cell factor for predicting embryo quality.,"We evaluated whether serum stem cell factor (s-SCF) levels just prior to ovulation induction could indicate the ability to develop a top-quality (TQ) blastocyst by day 5. We investigated patients with normal ovarian reserve (NOR), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), or mild endometriosis. Our pilot research suggests a correlation between s-SCF levels and the ability to form TQ blastocysts in patients with mild endometriosis. This significant statistical difference (p < 0.05) was noted between mild endometriosis patients for whom a TQ blastocyst was obtained and those for whom it was not possible, as measured on the 8th day of stimulation and the day of oocyte retrieval. The mean SCF levels in the serum of these women on the 8th day were at 28.07 (± 2.67) pg/ml for the TQ subgroup and 53.32 (± 16.02) pg/ml for the non-TQ subgroup (p < 0.05). On oocyte retrieval day it was 33.47 (± 3.93) pg/ml and 52.23 (± 9.72) pg/ml (p < 0.05), respectively.",['Liss J; Kuczyńska M; Kunicki M; Zieliński K; Drzyzga D'],2024,s-SCF levels just prior to ovulation induction could indicate the ability to develop a top-quality (TQ) blastocyst by day 5. the study was carried out by a pilot study.
Impaired distal renal potassium handling in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.,"Diabetes is closely associated with K<sup>+</sup> disturbances during disease progression and treatment. However, it remains unclear whether K<sup>+</sup> imbalance occurs in diabetes with normal kidney function. In this study, we examined the effects of dietary K<sup>+</sup> intake on systemic K<sup>+</sup> balance and renal K<sup>+</sup> handling in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The control and STZ mice were fed low or high K<sup>+</sup> diet for 7 days to investigate the role of dietary K<sup>+</sup> intake in renal K<sup>+</sup> excretion and K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis, and to explore the underlying mechanism by evaluating K<sup>+</sup> secretion-related transport proteins in distal nephrons. K<sup>+</sup>-deficient diet caused excessive urinary K<sup>+</sup> loss, decreased daily K<sup>+</sup> balance, and led to severe hypokalemia in STZ mice compared to control mice. In contrast, STZ mice showed an increased daily K<sup>+</sup> balance and elevated plasma K<sup>+</sup> level under K<sup>+</sup>-loading conditions. Dysregulation of the NaCl cotransporter (NCC), epithelia Na<sup>+</sup> channel (ENaC), and renal outer medullary K<sup>+</sup> channel (ROMK) was observed in diabetic mice fed either low or high K<sup>+</sup> diet. Moreover, amiloride treatment reduced urinary K<sup>+</sup> excretion and corrected hypokalemia in K<sup>+</sup>-restricted STZ mice. On the other hand, inhibition of SGLT2 by dapagliflozin promoted urinary K<sup>+</sup> excretion and normalized plasma K<sup>+</sup> level in K<sup>+</sup>-supplemented STZ mice, at least partly by increasing ENaC activity. We conclude that STZ mice exhibited abnormal K<sup>+</sup> balance and impaired renal K<sup>+</sup> handling under either low or high K<sup>+</sup> diet, which could be primarily attributed to the dysfunction of ENaC-dependent renal K<sup>+</sup> excretion pathway, despite the possible role of NCC.",['Wu P; Li ST; Shu TT; Mao ZH; Fu WJ; Yang YY; Pan SK; Liu DW; Liu ZS; Gao ZX'],2024,"dietary Ksup>+/sup> intake caused excessive urinary Ksup>+/sup> loss, decreased daily Ksup>+/sup> balance, and led to severe hypokalemia in STZ mice compared to control mice."
[Health-economic aspects of radiotherapy].,"Cancer care poses a significant economic burden, challenging healthcare budgets to balance patient benefits with affordability. Radiotherapy takes up only a limited part of oncology budgets, but the cost is rarely clear-cut due to influential factors such as complexity of treatments, highly-trained personnel and technologies. Health-economic appraisal is complex and can be performed in several ways, balancing costs and outcomes, but not all approaches are equally suitable for assessment of radiotherapy interventions. The concept of «value-based healthcare» offers a broader perspective to health-economic appraisal, considering various outcomes and the cost of the total cycle of care, thus addressing some of the challenges in radiotherapy: the diversity of interventions, a broad range of outcomes (including organ preservation or local control) and challenges in evidence generation. However, as the existing value-based frameworks in oncology are aimed at systemic therapies, a tailored approach for radiotherapy interventions is necessary to enhance access to innovative care and optimize resource allocation. This article explores the economic aspects of radiotherapy, providing an overview of radiotherapy cost determinants and calculations, discussing different health-economic strategies and value-based healthcare, and how these can address the specific challenges in radiotherapy.",['Vandemaele M; Lievens Y'],2024,"radiotherapy takes up only a limited part of oncology budgets. but the cost is rarely clear-cut due to influential factors such as complexity of treatments, highly-trained personnel and technologies."
Antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of two cyclic dipeptides produced by a new desert Streptomyces sp. HG-17 strain against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and biofilms requires discovering new antimicrobial agents from unexplored environments. This study aims to isolate and characterize a new actinobacterial strain from the Hoggar Mountains in southern Algeria and evaluate its ability to produce bioactive molecules with potential antibacterial and antibiofilm activities. A novel halotolerant actinobacterial strain, designated HG-17, was isolated from the Hoggar Mountains, and identified based on phenotypic characterizations, 16S rDNA sequence analysis, and phylogenetic analysis. The antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of the strain were assessed, and the presence of biosynthetic genes (PKS-I and NRPS) was confirmed. Two active compounds, HG-7 and HG-9, were extracted butanol solvent, purified by HPLC, and their chemical structures were elucidated using ESI mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The strain HG-17 was identified as Streptomyces purpureus NBRC with 98.8% similarity. It exhibited strong activity against multidrug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacteria. The two purified active compounds, HG-7 and HG-9, were identified as cyclo-(d-cis-hydroxyproline-l-phenylalanine) and cyclo-(l-prolone-l-tyrosine), respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of HG-7 and HG-9 ranged from 3 to 15 μg/mL, comparable to the MICs of tetracycline (8 to 15 μg/mL). Their minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC 50%) showed good inhibition from 48.0 to 52.0% at concentrations of 1 to 7 μg/mL against the tested bacteria. This is the first report of cyclo-(d-cis-hydroxyproline-l-phenylalanine) and cyclo-(l-prolone-l-tyrosine) antibiotics from S. purpureus and their anti-multi-drug-resistant and biofilm-forming bacteria.

Expert Perspectives on Controversies in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Management: Narrative Review and Report of the First US Prostate Cancer Conference Part 2.,"Management strategies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have rapidly shifted in recent years. As novel imaging and therapeutic approaches have made their way to the clinic, providers are encountering increasingly challenging clinical scenarios, with limited guidance from the current literature. The US Prostate Cancer Conference (USPCC) is a multidisciplinary meeting of prostate cancer experts intended to address the many challenges of prostate cancer management. At the first annual USPCC meeting, areas of controversy and consensus were identified during a 2-day meeting that included expert presentations, full-panel discussions, and postdiscussion responses to questions developed by the USPCC cochairs and session moderators. This narrative review covers the USPCC expert discussion and perspectives relevant to mCRPC, including neuroendocrine/aggressive-variant prostate cancer (NEPC/AVPC). Areas of broad agreement identified among USPCC experts include the benefits of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for patients with <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations, the use of radioligand therapy in patients with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive mCRPC, and the need for clinical trials that address real-world clinical questions, including the performance of novel therapies when compared with modern standard-of-care treatment. Ongoing areas of controversy and uncertainty included the appropriateness of PARP inhibitors in patients with non-<i>BRCA1/2</i> mutations, the optimal definition of PSMA positivity, and systemic therapies for patients with NEPC/AVPC after progression on platinum-based therapies. The first annual USPCC meeting identified several areas of controversy in the management of mCRPC, highlighting the urgent need for clinical trials designed to facilitate treatment selection and sequencing in this heterogeneous disease state.",['Bryce AH; Crawford ED; Agarwal N; Hussain MH; Beltran H; Cooperberg MR; Petrylak DP; Shore N; Spratt DE; Tagawa ST; Antonarakis ES; Aparicio AM; Armstrong AJ; Boike TP; Calais J; Carducci MA; Chapin BF; Cookson MS; Davis JW; Dorff T; Eggener SE; Feng FY; Gleave M; Higano C; Iagaru A; Morgans AK; Morris M; Murray KS; Poage W; Rettig MB; Sartor O; Scher HI; Sieber P; Small E; Srinivas S; Yu EY; Zhang T; Koo PJ'],2024,"the US Prostate Cancer Conference (USPCC) is a multidisciplinary meeting of prostate cancer experts. the meeting included expert presentations, full-panel discussions, and postdiscussion responses to questions developed by the USPCC cochairs and session moderators. areas of controversy and consensus were identified during a 2-day meeting that included topics of discussion and consensus."
Structure-specific rigid dose accumulation dosimetric analysis of ablative stereotactic MRI-guided adaptive radiation therapy in ultracentral lung lesions.,"Definitive local therapy with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) for ultracentral lung lesions is associated with a high risk of toxicity, including treatment related death. Stereotactic MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) can overcome many of the challenges associated with SABR treatment of ultracentral lesions. We retrospectively identified 14 consecutive patients who received SMART to ultracentral lung lesions from 10/2019 to 01/2021. Patients had a median distance from the proximal bronchial tree (PBT) of 0.38 cm. Tumors were most often lung primary (64.3%) and HILUS group A (85.7%). A structure-specific rigid registration approach was used for cumulative dose analysis. Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis was used for clinical outcome data and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used for dosimetric data. Here we show that SMART dosimetric improvements in favor of delivered plans over predicted non-adapted plans for PBT, with improvements in proximal bronchial tree DMax of 5.7 Gy (p = 0.002) and gross tumor 100% prescription coverage of 7.3% (p = 0.002). The mean estimated follow-up is 17.2 months and 2-year local control and local failure free survival rates are 92.9% and 85.7%, respectively. There are no grade ≥ 3 toxicities. SMART has dosimetric advantages and excellent clinical outcomes for ultracentral lung tumors. Daily plan adaptation reliably improves target coverage while simultaneously reducing doses to the proximal airways. These results further characterize the therapeutic window improvements for SMART. Structure-specific rigid dose accumulation dosimetric analysis provides insights that elucidate the dosimetric advantages of SMART more so than per fractional analysis alone.",['Bryant JM; Cruz-Chamorro RJ; Gan A; Liveringhouse C; Weygand J; Nguyen A; Keit E; Sandoval ML; Sim AJ; Perez BA; Dilling TJ; Redler G; Andreozzi J; Nardella L; Naghavi AO; Feygelman V; Latifi K; Rosenberg SA'],2024,SMART can overcome many of the challenges associated with SABR treatment of ultracentral lung lesions. a MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy can overcome many of the challenges associated with SABR treatment.
Transcription factor <i>ASCL1</i> targets <i>SLC6A13</i> to inhibit the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via the glycine-inflammasome signaling.,"The purpose of this research was to clarify the function of achaete-scute family bHLH transcription factor 1 (ASCL1) and solute carrier family 6 member 13 (SLC6A13) in influencing tumor cell behavior, inflammatory responses, and the regulation of inflammasomes. We analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) database, as well as in the GSE14520 and GSE67764 datasets, to identify the expression changes of SLC6A13 in liver cancer. The prognostic significance of SLC6A13 in LIHC was assessed through Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. Transcriptional regulation of SLC6A13 by ASCL1 was explored using the Joint Annotation of the Human Genome and other species by the Systematic Pipeline for the Annotation of Regulatory Regions (JASPAR) database and dual-luciferase assays. In vitro experiments investigated the impact of ASCL1 and SLC6A13 overexpression on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth. Additionally, the effects of ethanol treatment and glycine modulation on the inflammatory response in HCC cell lines were evaluated. HCC samples showed reduced levels of SLC6A13, which correlates with a better prognosis for liver metastases. Elevated SLC6A13 expression correlated with improved overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). ASCL1 upregulated SLC6A13 and inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Ethanol induced the production of inflammatory cytokines, which was enhanced by overexpression of SLC6A13 but counteracted by glycine. This study highlighted elevated expression of SLC6A13 in LIHC which has been correlated with improved OS, PFS, RFS, and DSS.

Hederagenin improves renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy by regulating Smad3/NOX4/SLC7A11 signaling-mediated tubular cell ferroptosis.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes, characterized by renal fibrosis and poor patient prognosis. Hederagenin (HDG) has shown promising improvement in chronic kidney disease (CKD) kidney fibrosis, but its mechanism in DN-induced kidney fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, a model of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (50 mg/kg), while in vitro, high glucose (25 mM) was used to induce HK2 cell damage, simulating tubular injury in DN kidneys. The improvement of HDG treatment intervention was evaluated by observing changes in renal function, pathological structural damage, and the expression of fibrosis-related proteins in renal tubular cells. The results demonstrate that HDG intervention alleviates renal dysfunction and pathological damage in DN mice, accompanied by reduced expression of fibrotic markers α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin (FN) and Collagen-I. Mechanistically, this study found that HDG can inhibit ferroptosis and fibrosis induced by the ferroptosis inducer Erastin (1 μM) in renal tubular cells. Phosphorylation of Smad3 promotes ferroptosis in renal tubular cells. After using its specific inhibitor SIS3 (4 μM), the expression of downstream target protein NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) significantly decreases, while the level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is notably restored, mitigating ferroptosis. Smad3 overexpression attenuates the therapeutic effect of HDG on tubular cell fibrosis induced by high glucose. These results demonstrate HDG inhibits Smad3 phosphorylation, thereby reducing the expression of NOX4 and enhancing the expression of GPX4, ultimately attenuating ferroptosis induced renal fibrosis. These findings suggest that HDG offer therapeutic potential for DN renal fibrosis by targeting Smad3-mediated ferroptosis in renal tubular cells.",['Jia J; Tan R; Xu L; Wang H; Li J; Su H; Zhong X; Liu P; Wang L'],2024,"DN-induced renal fibrosis is a common complication of diabetes. a model of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (50 mg/kg). in vitro, high glucose (25 mM) was used to induce HK2 cell damage."

Multi-Institutional Study of Referral Patterns for Gynecologic Oncology Consultation.,"Evaluation by a gynecologic oncologist (GO) is associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients with gynecologic cancers, yet little is known about health care factors that influence patients' referrals to GO. Medical records of 50 consecutive new patients seen in GO clinics at each of six referral centers across the United States were reviewed. Patient and disease characteristics were collected along with referral indication, evaluation and referral dates, diagnostic procedures, provider specialties, and zone improvement plan (ZIP) code of up to three referring providers per patient. The primary outcome was interval between first evaluation and referral. Univariate associations were evaluated with Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and multivariable associations with negative binomial regression models. Secondary outcome was prolonged time to GO referral, defined as greater than the 75th percentile. Logistic regression was used for multivariable modeling. Three hundred patient records were analyzed. The median time from first health care encounter to referral was 15 days (IQR, 5-43). The mean distance from residence to GO was 39.8 miles (standard deviation, 53.8). Seventy-one percent of GO referrals were initiated by obstetrician-gynecologists, 9% by family physicians, and 6% internists. Presentation-to-referral interval was 76% shorter for patients evaluated by an emergency medicine clinician (exp(Beta), 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.53; <i>P</i> < .001). Public insurance was associated with 1.47 times longer time to referral compared with private insurance (exp(Beta), 1.47; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.04; <i>P</i> = .001). Residents of nonmetropolitan ZIP codes were less likely to have prolonged time to referral (odds ratio [OR], 0.288; <i>P</i> = .017). Distance from residence to GO (per 10 miles) increased the likelihood of prolonged time to referral (OR, 1.10; <i>P</i> = .010). Interventions are needed to improve recognition and referral of patients for gynecologic oncology evaluation. Community outreach and engagement with obstetrician-gynecologists should be prioritized to improve times to referral.",['DeMari JA; Madeka I; Evans JK; Bailey C; Bartucci K; Bottsford-Miller J; Bradford L; Burnett B; Kelly R; Rowland M; Wallbillich JJ; Shalowitz DI'],2024,medical records of 50 consecutive new patients seen in GO clinics were reviewed. primary outcome was interval between first evaluation and referral. logistic regression was used for multivariable modeling.
Hypofractionated radiotherapy concomitant to capecitabine after induction chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.,"To assess feasibility, toxicity and outcome of moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy concomitant to capecitabine after induction chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer without distant progression after induction chemotherapy (CHT) were considered. Radiochemotherapy (RCT) consisted of 44.25 Gy in 15 fractions to the tumor and involved lymph-nodes concomitant to capecitabine 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day. Feasibility and toxicity were evaluated in all pts. Overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant PFS (DPFS) and local PFS (LPFS) were assessed only in stage III patients. 254 patients, 220 stage III, 34 stage IV, were treated. Median follow up was 19 months. Induction CHT consisted of Gemcitabine (35 patients), or drug combination (219 patients); median duration was 6 months.Four patients (1.6 %) did not complete RT (1 early progression, 3 toxicity), median duration of RT was 20 days, 209 patients (82 %) received ≥ 75 % of capecitabine dose.During RCT G3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 3.2% of patients, G3-G4 hematologic toxicity in 5.4% of patients.

Use of defibrotide in COVID-19 pneumonia: comparison of a phase II study and a matched real-world cohort control.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an unprecedented burden on healthcare systems around the world and a severe global socioeconomic crisis, with more than 750 million confirmed cases and at least 7 million deaths reported by 31st December 2023. The DEFI-VID19 study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04335201), a phase II, single-arm, multicenter, open-label trial was designed in mid-2020 to assess the safety and efficacy of defibrotide in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Defibrotide was administered at a dose of 25 mg/kg/d intravenously, divided into four daily doses over a planned 14-day period for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia receiving non-invasive ventilation. The primary endpoint was Respiratory Failure Free Survival (RFFS); Overall Survival (OS), the number of post-recovery days, and adverse events were the secondary endpoints. For comparison, a contemporaneous control cohort receiving standard of care only was retrospectively selected by applying the eligibility criteria of the DEFI-VID19 trial. To adjust for the imbalance between the two cohorts in terms of baseline variable distributions, an outcome regression analysis was conducted. In adjusted analysis, patients receiving defibrotide reported a trend towards higher RFFS (HR=0.71[0.95CI: 0.34 to 1.29, P= .138]) and OS (HR=0.78[0.95CI: 0.33 to 1.53, P= .248]) and showed a significantly increased number of post-recovery days (difference in means: 3.61[ 0.95CI: 0.97 to 6.26, P= .0037]). Despite concomitant thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, the safety profile of defibrotide proved to be favorable.

Impact of High Dose Early Mobilization on Outcomes for Patients with Diabetes: A Secondary Analysis of the TEAM Trial.,"Patients with diabetes represent almost 20% of all ICU admissions and might respond differently to high dose early active mobilization. To assess whether diabetes modified the relationship between the dose of early mobilization on clinical outcomes in the TEAM trial. All TEAM trial patients were included. The primary outcome was days alive and out of hospital at day 180. Secondary outcomes included 180-day mortality and long-term functional outcomes at day 180. Logistic and median regression models were used to explore the effect of high dose early mobilization on outcomes by diabetes status. All 741 patients from the original trial were included. Of these, 159 patients (21.4%) had diabetes. Patients with diabetes had a lower number of days alive and out of hospital at day 180 (124 [0-153] vs. 147 [82-164], <i>p</i> = 0.013), and higher 180-day mortality (30% vs. 18%, <i>p</i> = 0.044). In patients receiving high dose early mobilization, days alive and out of hospital at day 180 was 73.0 (0.0 - 144.5) in patients with diabetes and 146.5 (95.8 - 163.0) in patients without diabetes (<i>p</i> for interaction = 0.108). However, in patients with diabetes, high dose early mobilization increased the odds of mortality at 180 days (adjusted odds ratio 3.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-7.61, <i>p</i> value for interaction, 0.001).

"Semaglutide for management of obesity in adolescents: efficacy, safety, and considerations for clinical practice.","The purpose of this review is to describe the existing limited data related to the use of semaglutide in adolescents with obesity, supplementing with findings from adult studies of semaglutide use. Semaglutide, as a once weekly subcutaneous injection for weight management, effectively reduces body mass index (BMI) while improving hyperglycemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, hyperlipidemia, and quality of life in youth with obesity. As of this review, only one large randomized clinical trial of semaglutide in youth has been completed, with a follow-up duration of 68 weeks. Thus, long-term data on the safety in adolescents is limited, particularly regarding the risks of cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, suicidal ideation, and disordered eating. Due to the cost of semaglutide, particularly in the United States, limited cost effectiveness analyses have demonstrated unfavorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for semaglutide relative to phentermine-topiramate as an alternative antiobesity medication in adolescents. Semaglutide represents an important advance in the pediatric obesity management, with clear short-term reductions in BMI and improvement in metabolic parameters. However, its long-term safety and efficacy for youth with obesity remain to be demonstrated. Additional research is needed to assess trends in utilization and adherence to minimize the risk of worsening socioeconomic disparities in pediatric obesity.",['Bensignor MO; Arslanian S; Vajravelu ME'],2024,"semaglutide effectively reduces body mass index (BMI) while improving hyperglycemia, elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, hyperlipidemia, and quality of life in youth with obesity. only one large randomized clinical trial of semaglutide in youth has been completed, with a follow-up duration of 68 weeks."
Therapeutic mechanisms of modified Jiawei Juanbi decoction in early knee osteoarthritis: A multimodal analysis.,"Modified Jiawei Juanbi decoction (MJD) is used for the treatment of early-stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Here, modified Jiawei Juanbi decoction (MJD) was employed for the treatment of early-stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and its mechanisms were assessed via metabonomics and network pharmacology. A total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into a normal control group, a model group, and an MJD group (n = 8 rats per group). Each rat group was further equally divided into two subgroups for investigation for either 14 or 28 days. A rat model of early-stage KOA was constructed and rats were treated with MJD. Effects were evaluated based on changes in knee circumference, mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL). We also analyzed histopathological changes in articular cartilage. High-resolution mass spectrometry was used to analyze the chemical profile of MJD, identifying 228 components. Using an LC-Q-TOF-MS metabonomics approach, 33 differential metabolites were identified. The relevant pathways significantly associated with MJD include arginine and proline metabolism, vitamin B6 metabolism, as well as the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. The system pharmacology paradigm revealed that MJD contains 1027 components and associates with 1637 genes, of which 862 disease genes are related to osteoarthritis. The construction of the MJD composition-target-KOA network revealed a total of 140 intersection genes. A total of 39 hub genes were identified via integration of betweenness centrality values greater than 100 using CytoHubba. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed several significantly affected signaling pathways including the HIF-1, AGE-RAGE (in diabetic complications), IL-17, rheumatoid arthritis and TNF pathways. Integrated-omics and network pharmacology approaches revealed a necessity for further detailed investigation focusing on two major targets, namely NOS2 and NOS3, along with their essential metabolite (arginine) and associated pathways (HIF-1 signaling and arginine and proline metabolism). Real-time PCR validated significantly greater downregulation of NOS2 and HIF-1ɑ in the MJD as compared to the model group. Molecular docking analysis further confirmed the binding of active MJD with key active components. Our findings elucidate the impact of MJD on relevant pathophysiological and metabolic networks relevant to KOA and assess the drug efficacy of MJD and its underlying mechanisms of action.",['Gao K; Huang Z; Yu W; Wu Y; Liu W; Sun S; Zhang Y; Chen D'],2024,"modified Jiawei Juanbi decoction (MJD) was employed for the treatment of early-stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA) a total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into a normal control group, a model group, and an MJD group (n = 8 rats per group) each rat group was equally equally divided into two subgroups for investigation for either 14 or 28 days."
Association of serum metal levels with type 2 diabetes: A prospective cohort and mediating effects of metabolites analysis in Chinese population.,"Several studies have suggested an association between exposure to various metals and the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the results vary across different studies. We aimed to investigate the associations between serum metal concentrations and the risk of developing T2D among 8734 participants using a prospective cohort study design. We utilized inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to assess the serum concentrations of 27 metals. Cox regression was applied to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations between serum metal concentrations on the risk of developing T2D. Additionally, 196 incident T2D cases and 208 healthy control participants were randomly selected for serum metabolite measurement using an untargeted metabolomics approach to evaluate the mediating role of serum metabolite in the relationship between serum metal concentrations and the risk of developing T2D with a nested casecontrol study design. In the cohort study, after Bonferroni correction, the serum concentrations of zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), and thallium (Tl) were positively associated with the risk of developing T2D, whereas the serum concentrations of manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), barium (Ba), lutetium (Lu), and lead (Pb) were negatively associated with the risk of developing T2D. After adding these eight metals, the predictive ability increased significantly compared with that of the traditional clinical model (AUC: 0.791 vs. 0.772, P=8.85×10<sup>-5</sup>). In the nested casecontrol study, a machine learning analysis revealed that the serum concentrations of 14 out of 1579 detected metabolites were associated with the risk of developing T2D. According to generalized linear regression models, 7 of these metabolites were significantly associated with the serum concentrations of the identified metals. The mediation analysis showed that two metabolites (2-methyl-1,2-dihydrophthalazin-1-one and mestranol) mediated 46.81% and 58.70%, respectively, of the association between the serum Pb concentration and the risk of developing T2D. Our study suggested that serum Mn, Zn, Mo, Ba, Lu, Hg, Tl, and Pb were associated with T2D risk.

Testosterone Exacerbates the Formation of Liver Cancer Induced by Environmental N-Nitrosamines Exposure: Potential Mechanisms and Implications for Human Health.,"Humans are frequently exposed to N-nitrosamines through various sources, including diet, cigarette smoking, contaminated water, the atmosphere, and endogenous nitrosation. Exposure to these carcinogens may also contribute to the gender-specific incidence of liver cancer, which is significantly higher in males than in females, possibly due to the influence of endogenous hormones such as testosterone. However, the effect of testosterone on N-nitrosamine-induced liver cancer and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the effect of testosterone on the development of liver cancer induced by N-nitrosamines exposure. Histopathological and immunohistochemical staining techniques were employed to analyze the expression levels and nuclear localizations of key signaling molecules, including androgen receptor (AR), β-catenin, and HMGB1, in both tumor and non-tumor regions of liver samples obtained from human patients and mice. The findings demonstrated a strong correlation between AR and β-catenin in the nuclear region of tumor areas. AR also showed a significant correlation with HMGB1 in the cytoplasmic region of non-tumor areas in both human and mice samples. The study further analyzed the expression levels and patterns of these three proteins during the progression of liver tumors. This study confirms that AR has the ability to modulate the expression levels and patterns of β-catenin and HMGB1 in vivo, thereby exacerbating the progression of liver cancer induced by environmental N-nitrosamines exposure. Importantly, the effect of testosterone on the formation of liver cancer induced by environmental N-nitrosamine exposure intensifies this progression. These findings have important implications for drug safety in clinical practice and emphasize the significance of reducing N-nitrosamines exposure through conscious choices regarding diet and lifestyle to ensure environmental safety.",['Yin X; Gu HW; Ning D; Li YS; Tang HB'],2024,exposure to these carcinogens may also contribute to gender-specific liver cancer. the effect of testosterone on the development of liver cancer remains unclear.
Hemoglobin A1c Trajectories During Pregnancy and Adverse Outcomes in Women With Type 2 Diabetes: A Danish National Population-Based Cohort Study.,"To identify and characterize groups of pregnant women with type 2 diabetes with distinct hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) trajectories across gestation and to examine the association with adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. This was a retrospective Danish national cohort study including all singleton pregnancies in women with type 2 diabetes, giving birth to a liveborn infant, between 2004 and 2019. HbA1c trajectories were identified using latent class linear mixed-model analysis. Associations with adverse outcomes were examined with logistic regression models. A total of 1,129 pregnancies were included. Three HbA1c trajectory groups were identified and named according to the glycemic control in early pregnancy (good, 59%; moderate, 32%; and poor, 9%). According to the model, all groups attained an estimated HbA1c <6.5% (48 mmol/mol) during pregnancy, with no differences between groups in the 3rd trimester. Women with poor glycemic control in early pregnancy had lower odds of having an infant with large for gestational age (LGA) birth weight (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.40-0.83), and higher odds of having an infant with small for gestational age (SGA) birth weight (aOR 2.49, 95% CI 2.00-3.10) and congenital malformation (CM) (aOR 4.60 95% CI 3.39-6.26) compared with women with good glycemic control.

Sphingosine is involved in PAPTP-induced death of pancreas cancer cells by interfering with mitochondrial functions.,"Pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma belongs to the most common cancers, but also to the tumors with the poorest prognosis. Here, we pharmacologically targeted a mitochondrial potassium channel, namely mitochondrial Kv1.3, and investigated the role of sphingolipids and mutated Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus (KRAS) in Kv1.3-mediated cell death. We demonstrate that inhibition of Kv1.3 using the Kv1.3-inhibitor PAPTP results in an increase of sphingosine and superoxide in membranes and/or membranes associated with mitochondria, which is enhanced by KRAS mutation. The effect of PAPTP on sphingosine and mitochondrial superoxide formation as well as cell death is prevented by sh-RNA-mediated downregulation of Kv1.3. Induction of sphingosine in human pancreas cancer cells by PAPTP is mediated by activation of sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase and prevented by an inhibitor of sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase. A rapid depolarization of isolated mitochondria is triggered by binding of sphingosine to cardiolipin, which is neutralized by addition of exogenous cardiolipin. The significance of these findings is indicated by treatment of mutated KRAS-harboring metastasized pancreas cancer with PAPTP in combination with ABC294640, a blocker of sphingosine kinases. This treatment results in increased formation of sphingosine and death of pancreas cancer cells in vitro and, most importantly, prolongs in vivo survival of mice challenged with metastatic pancreas cancer. KEY MESSAGES: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a common tumor with poor prognosis. The mitochondrial Kv1.3 ion channel blocker induced mitochondrial sphingosine. Sphingosine binds to cardiolipin thereby mediating mitochondrial depolarization. Sphingosine is formed by a PAPTP-mediated activation of S1P-Phosphatase.

"Risk factors, histopathological landscape, biomarkers, treatment patterns and survival of early-onset colorectal cancer: A narrative review.","Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) incidence has increased in most Western countries over the last decade, with Australia at the forefront. Recent literature has thus focused on characterizing EOCRC from later-onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC). Earlier exposure to modifiable risk factors resulting in gut dysbiosis has been linked with EOCRC development. EOCRCs have more aggressive histopathological features with somatic mutations resulting in pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironments. There is a tendency to treat EOCRCs with multimodal chemotherapeutic regimens and more extensive surgery than LOCRCs with conflicting postoperative outcomes and survival data. Current research is limited by a lack of Australasian studies, retrospective study designs, and heterogeneous definitions of EOCRC. Future research should address these and focus on investigating the role of immunotherapies, establishing minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers and nomograms, and evaluating the survival and functional outcomes of EOCRC.",['Garrett C; Steffens D; Ackland S; Solomon M; Koh C'],2024,early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) incidence has increased in most western countries over the last decade. early exposure to modifiable risk factors resulting in gut dysbiosis has been linked with EOCRC development.
Pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine protein-kinase 2 reduces islet inflammation and delays type 1 diabetes onset in mice.,"Tyrosine protein-kinase 2 (TYK2), a member of the Janus kinase family, mediates inflammatory signaling through multiple cytokines, including interferon-α (IFNα), interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-23. Missense mutations in TYK2 are associated with protection against type 1 diabetes (T1D), and inhibition of TYK2 shows promise in the management of other autoimmune conditions. Here, we evaluated the effects of specific TYK2 inhibitors (TYK2is) in pre-clinical models of T1D. First, human β cells, cadaveric donor islets, and iPSC-derived islets were treated <i>in vitro</i> with IFNα in combination with a small molecule TYK2i (BMS-986165 or a related molecule BMS-986202). TYK2 inhibition prevented IFNα-induced β cell HLA class I up-regulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and chemokine production. In co-culture studies, pre-treatment of β cells with a TYK2i prevented IFNα-induced activation of T cells targeting an epitope of insulin. <i>In vivo</i> administration of BMS-986202 in two mouse models of T1D ( <i>RIP-LCMV-GP</i> mice and NOD mice) reduced systemic and tissue-localized inflammation, prevented β cell death, and delayed T1D onset. Transcriptional phenotyping of pancreatic islets, pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), and spleen during early disease pathogenesis highlighted a role for TYK2 inhibition in modulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation, translational control, stress signaling, secretory function, immunity, and diabetes. Additionally, TYK2i treatment changed the composition of innate and adaptive immune cell populations in the blood and disease target tissues, resulting in an immune phenotype with a diminished capacity for β cell destruction. Overall, these findings indicate that TYK2i has beneficial effects in both the immune and endocrine compartments in models of T1D, thus supporting a path forward for testing TYK2 inhibitors in human T1D.",['Syed F; Ballew O; Lee CC; Rana J; Krishnan P; Castela A; Weaver SA; Chalasani NS; Thomaidou SF; Demine S; Chang G; Coomans de Brachène A; Alvelos MI; Marselli L; Orr K; Felton JL; Liu J; Marchetti P; Zaldumbide A; Scheuner D; Eizirik DL; Evans-Molina C'],2024,"TYK2 mediates inflammatory signaling through multiple cytokines.  cells, cadaveric donor islets, and iPSC-derived islets were treated.  cells were treated i>in vitro/i> with IFN."

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NSCLC patients undergoing sequential EGFR-TKI treatment at Shanghai Chest Hospital between October 2016 and August 2021. The heart rate (HR), top-QT interval, and top-QTc of their ECGs were extracted from the institutional database and analyzed. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors for top-QTc prolongation. Overall, 228 patients were enrolled. Compared with baseline (median, 368 ms, same below), both first-generation (376 ms vs. 368 ms, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and sequential third-generation EGFR-TKIs (376 ms vs. 368 ms, <i>p</i> = 0.002) prolonged top-QT interval to a similar extent (<i>p</i> = 0.635). Top-QTc (438 ms vs. 423 ms, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and HR (81 bpm vs.79 bpm, <i>p</i> = 0.008) increased after first-generation EGFR-TKI treatment. Further top-QTc prolongation (453 ms vs. 438 ms, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and HR increase (88 bpm vs. 81 bpm, <i>p</i> < 0.001) occurred after treatment advanced. Notably, as HR elevated during treatment, top-QT interval paradoxically increased rather than decreased, and the top-QTc increased rather than slightly fluctuated. Moreover, such phenomena were more significant after treatment advanced. After adjusting for confounding factors, pericardial effusion and lower serum potassium levels were independent predictors of additional QTc prolongation during sequential third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment. First-generation EGFR-TKI could prolong top-QTc, and sequential third-generation EGFR-TKI induced further prolongation. Top-QT interval paradoxically increased and top-QTc significantly increased as HR elevated, which was more significant after sequential EGFR-TKI treatment.

Characteristics and risk of stroke in emergency department patients with acute dizziness.,"Acute dizziness is a common symptom in the emergency department (ED), with strokes accounting for 3 %-5 % of cases. We investigated the risk of stroke in ED patients with acute dizziness and compared stroke characteristics diagnosed during and after the ED visit. We identified adult patients with acute dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance using a hospital research-based database. Patients with abdominal or flank pain were used as the comparison group. Patients with dizziness were 1:1 matched to comparison patients. Each patient was traced for up to one year until being hospitalized for a stroke. Out of the 24,266 eligible patients, 589 (2.4 %) were hospitalized for stroke during the ED visit. For the remaining 23,677 patients, the risk of stroke at 7, 30, 90, and 365 days after ED discharge was 0.40 %, 0.52 %, 0.71 %, and 1.25 % respectively. Patients with dizziness had a higher risk of stroke compared to the comparison group at 7, 30, 90, and 365 days. The risk ratios decreased from 5.69 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3.34-9.68) to 2.03 (95 % CI, 1.65-2.49). Compared to patients hospitalized for stroke during the ED visit, those hospitalized for stroke after the ED visit had greater stroke severity despite a lower initial triage acuity. Patients with early stroke (≤7 days) after ED discharge were less likely to have hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation. They mostly experienced posterior circulation stroke. Patients with late stroke (>7 days) were older and less likely to have hypertension and hyperlipidemia but more likely to have a history of prior stroke and ischemic heart disease. Their strokes were mainly located in the anterior circulation territory. The risk of stroke after ED discharge was higher in patients with dizziness than in the comparison group, with gradually decreasing risk ratios in the following year. Patients hospitalized for stroke during and after the ED visit had different profiles of vascular risk factors and clinical characteristics.",['Chang YS; Tsai MJ; Hsieh CY; Sung SF'],2024,strokes accounting for 3 %-5 % of cases in ED patients. patients with acute dizziness were 1:1 matched to comparison patients. each patient was traced for up to one year until being hospitalized for a stroke.
"A Case of Thrombocytopenia, Anasarca (Edema, Pleural Effusion, and Ascites), Fever, Reticulin Fibrosis/Renal Dysfunction, and Organomegaly (TAFRO) Syndrome Initially Not Presenting With Thrombocytopenia: A Role of Immature Platelet Fraction.","Thrombocytopenia, anasarca (edema, pleural effusion, and ascites), fever, reticulin fibrosis/renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (TAFRO) syndrome is a rare and severe systemic disease. The emergence of thrombocytopenia, however, may be preceded by other signs or symptoms, which could delay the diagnosis of the disease. We reported a case in which an increased immature platelet fraction (IPF), a surrogate marker for megakaryocytic activity, preceded the development of thrombocytopenia, and finally, we diagnosed the patient with TAFRO syndrome. A 79-year-old male with a previous history of uninephrectomy due to bladder and ureteral cancer was admitted to our hospital because of massive edema and progressive impairment in renal function. On admission, inguinal lymphadenopathy, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), bilateral pleural effusion, and ascites were observed, and the lymph node biopsy showed that atrophic lymphoid follicles and germinal centers were observed along with prominent glomeruloid vascular proliferation and the expansion of the interfollicular spaces consistent with the feature of Castleman's disease. The peripheral platelet count did not reach the level of the criteria for TAFRO syndrome (13.9×10<sup>4</sup>/µL), but the immature platelet fraction was increased (11.6%), and bone marrow biopsy revealed hyperplasia of megakaryocytes. During the course of the preemptive treatment with prednisolone and tocilizumab, thrombocytopenia was uncovered, and the patient was finally diagnosed as having TAFRO syndrome. Thus, the present case may offer valuable information on the role of the immature platelet fraction in the establishment of the early diagnosis of TAFRO syndrome.",['Kanda M; Kitamura K; Saito A; Hayashi K; Suzuki T'],2024,"thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis/renal dysfunction are rare and severe systemic disease. thrombocytopenia may be preceded by other signs or symptoms, which could delay the diagnosis of the disease."
Pharmacogenomic analysis in adrenocortical carcinoma reveals genetic features associated with mitotane sensitivity and potential therapeutics.,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive endocrine malignancy with limited therapeutic options. Treating advanced ACC with mitotane, the cornerstone therapy, remains challenging, thus underscoring the significance to predict mitotane response prior to treatment and seek other effective therapeutic strategies. We aimed to determine the efficacy of mitotane via an <i>in vitro</i> assay using patient-derived ACC cells (PDCs), identify molecular biomarkers associated with mitotane response and preliminarily explore potential agents for ACC. <i>In vitro</i> mitotane sensitivity testing was performed in 17 PDCs and high-throughput screening against 40 compounds was conducted in 8 PDCs. Genetic features were evaluated in 9 samples using exomic and transcriptomic sequencing. PDCs exhibited variable sensitivity to mitotane treatment. The median cell viability inhibition rate was 48.4% (IQR: 39.3-59.3%) and -1.2% (IQR: -26.4-22.1%) in responders (n=8) and non-responders (n=9), respectively. Median IC50 and AUC were remarkably lower in responders (IC50: 53.4 µM vs 74.7 µM, P<0.0001; AUC: 158.0 vs 213.5, P<0.0001). Genomic analysis revealed <i>CTNNB1</i> somatic alterations were only found in responders (3/5) while <i>ZNRF3</i> alterations only in non-responders (3/4). Transcriptomic profiling found pathways associated with lipid metabolism were upregulated in responder tumors whilst <i>CYP27A1</i> and <i>ABCA1</i> expression were positively correlated to <i>in vitro</i> mitotane sensitivity. Furthermore, pharmacologic analysis identified that compounds including disulfiram, niclosamide and bortezomib exhibited efficacy against PDCs. ACC PDCs could be useful for testing drug response, drug repurposing and guiding personalized therapies. Our results suggested response to mitotane might be associated with the dependency on lipid metabolism. <i>CYP27A1</i> and <i>ABCA1</i> expression could be predictive markers for mitotane response, and disulfiram, niclosamide and bortezomib could be potential therapeutics, both warranting further investigation.",['Zhang J; Wu L; Su T; Liu H; Jiang L; Jiang Y; Wu Z; Chen L; Li H; Zheng J; Sun Y; Peng H; Han R; Ning G; Ye L; Wang W'],2024,ACC is an aggressive endocrine malignancy with limited therapeutic options.

Cardioprotective potentials of myricetin on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity based on biochemical and transcriptomic analysis.,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used anthracycline in cancer chemotherapy. The clinical application of DOX is constrained by its cardiotoxicity. Myricetin (MYR) is a natural flavonoid widely present in many plants with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, MYR's beneficial effects and mechanisms in alleviating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) remain unknown. C57BL/6 mice were injected with 15 mg/kg of DOX to establish the DIC, and MYR solutions were administrated by gavage to investigate its cardioprotective potentials. Histopathological analysis, physiological indicators assessment, transcriptomics analysis, and RT-qPCR were used to elucidate the potential mechanism of MYR in DIC treatment. MYR reduced cardiac injury produced by DOX, decreased levels of cTnI, AST, LDH, and BNP, and improved myocardial injury and fibrosis. MYR effectively prevented DOX-induced oxidative stress, such as lowered MDA levels and elevated SOD, CAT, and GSH activities. MYR effectively suppressed NLRP3 and ASC gene expression levels to inhibit pyroptosis while regulating Caspase1 and Bax levels to reduce cardiac cell apoptosis. According to the transcriptomic analysis, glucose and fatty acid metabolism were associated with differential gene expression. KEGG pathway analysis revealed differential gene enrichment in PPAR and AMPK pathways, among others. Following validation, MYR was found to alleviate DIC by regulating glycolipid metabolism and AMPK pathway-related genes. Our findings demonstrated that MYR could mitigate DIC by regulating the processes of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and pyroptosis. MYR is critical in improving DOX-induced myocardial energy metabolism abnormalities mediated by the AMPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, MYR holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for DIC.",['Li J; Luo T; Zhao Y; Wang D; Jin Y; Wu Z; Yang G; Qi X'],2024,DIC treatment is constrained by its cardiotoxicity. a molecule known as myricetin (MYR) is a flavonoid widely present in many plants.
Mind the Gap in Kidney Care: Translating What We Know Into What We do.,"Historically, it takes an average of 17 years to move new treatments from clinical evidence to daily practice. Given the highly effective treatments now available to prevent or delay kidney disease onset and progression, this is far too long. The time is now to narrow the gap between what we know and what we do. Clear guidelines exist for the prevention and management of common risk factors for kidney disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but only a fraction of people with these conditions worldwide are diagnosed, and even fewer are treated to target. Similarly, the vast majority of people living with kidney disease are unaware of their condition, because in the early stages, it is often silent. Even among patients who have been diagnosed, many do not receive appropriate treatment for kidney disease. Considering the serious consequences of kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or death, it is imperative that treatments are initiated early and appropriately. Opportunities to diagnose and treat kidney disease early must be maximized beginning at the primary-care level. Many systematic barriers exist, ranging from patient to clinician to health systems to societal factors. To preserve and improve kidney health for everyone everywhere, each of these barriers must be acknowledged so that sustainable solutions are developed and implemented without further delay.",['Luyckx VA; Tuttle KR; Abdellatif D; Correa-Rotter R; Fung WWS; Haris A; Hsiao LL; Khalife M; Kumaraswami LA; Loud F; Raghavan V; Roumeliotis S; Sierra M; Ulasi I; Wang B; Lui SF; Liakopoulos V; Balducci A'],2024,"a fraction of people with kidney disease worldwide are diagnosed. many do not receive appropriate treatment for kidney disease. many systematic barriers exist, from patient to clinician to health systems."
A Rare Case of Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Associated with Aquaporin 2 Gene Mutation and Subsequent Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Impact of Steroids on Kidney Function.,"BACKGROUND Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare renal disorder that can be congenital, and is caused by mutations in either aquaporin 2 or arginine vasopressin receptor 2, or it can be secondary to kidney disease or electrolyte imbalance. The clinical signs of NDI include polyuria, compensatory polydipsia, hypernatremic dehydration, and growth retardation without prompt treatment. In this report, we present the case of a patient with congenital NDI who was later diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). With dexamethasone treatment, he had uncontrolled polyuria and polydipsia. Our aim was to concentrate on the impact of steroids on the kidneys. CASE REPORT Our patient presented at the age of 9 months with signs of severe dehydration that were associated with polyuria. His laboratory examinations revealed hypernatremia and decreased urine osmolality. He was diagnosed with NDI and his exome sequence revealed a homozygous mutation at the nucleotide position AQP2 NM_000486.6: c.374C>T (p.Thr125Met). He was treated with hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Then, at age 19 months, he presented with gastroenteritis and a complete blood count (CBC) showed high white blood cell count and blast cells. He was diagnosed with (ALL) and began receiving chemotherapy, during which again developed polydipsia and polyuria, which could not be controlled with an increased dosage of hydrochlorothiazide. CONCLUSIONS We report a rare case of NDI caused by a missense mutation in the aquaporin 2 gene. One year later, the child developed ALL, and treatment with dexamethasone led to an uncompensated state of polydipsia and polyuria.",['Al-Thiabat H; Abu-Aqoulah A; Kanaan D; Matalka MI; Al-Sweedan S'],2024,NDI is a rare renal disorder that can be congenital. it is caused by mutations in aquaporin 2 or arginine vasopressin receptor 2. it can be secondary to kidney disease or electrolyte imbalance.
Coeliac disease and type 2 diabetes risk: a nationwide matched cohort and Mendelian randomisation study.,"While the association between coeliac disease and type 1 diabetes is well documented, the association of coeliac disease with type 2 diabetes risk remains undetermined. We conducted a nationwide cohort and Mendelian randomisation analysis to investigate this link. This nationwide matched cohort used data from the Swedish ESPRESSO cohort including 46,150 individuals with coeliac disease and 219,763 matched individuals in the comparator group selected from the general population, followed up from 1969 to 2021. Data from 9053 individuals with coeliac disease who underwent a second biopsy were used to examine the association between persistent villous atrophy and type 2 diabetes. Multivariable Cox regression was employed to estimate the associations. In Mendelian randomisation analysis, 37 independent genetic variants associated with clinically diagnosed coeliac disease at p<5×10<sup>-8</sup> were used to proxy genetic liability to coeliac disease. Summary-level data for type 2 diabetes were obtained from the DIAGRAM consortium (80,154 cases) and the FinnGen study (42,593 cases). Over a median 15.7 years' follow-up, there were 6132 (13.3%) and 30,138 (13.7%) incident cases of type 2 diabetes in people with coeliac disease and comparator individuals, respectively. Those with coeliac disease were not at increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes with an HR of 1.00 (95% CI 0.97, 1.03) compared with comparator individuals. Persistent villous atrophy was not associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared with mucosal healing among participants with coeliac disease (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90, 1.16). Genetic liability to coeliac disease was not associated with type 2 diabetes in DIAGRAM (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99, 1.03) or in FinnGen (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.99-1.04).

Hyperglycemia-simulating environment attenuated experimentally induced calcification in cultured human aortic valve interstitial cells.,"<i>Objectives:</i> The role of diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for the development of calcific aortic valve disease has not been fully clarified. Aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) have been suggested to be crucial for calcification of the valve. Induced calcification in cultured VICs is a good <i>in vitro</i> model for aortic valve calcification. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether increased glucose levels increase experimentally induced calcification in cultured human VICs. <i>Design:</i> VICs were isolated from explanted calcified aortic valves after valve replacement. Osteogenic medium induced calcification of cultured VICs at different glucose levels (5, 15, and 25 mM). Calcium deposits were visualized using Alizarin Red staining and measured spectrophotometrically. <i>Results:</i> The higher the glucose concentration, the lower the level of calcification. High glucose (25 mM) reduced calcification by 52% compared with calcification at a physiological (5 mM) glucose concentration (correlation and regression analysis: <i>r</i> = -0.55, <i>p</i> = .025 with increased concentration of glucose). <i>Conclusions: In vitro</i> hyperglycemia-like conditions attenuated calcification in VICs.

Biallelic FANCA variants detected in sisters with isolated premature ovarian insufficiency.,"Premature ovarian insufficiency is a common form of female infertility affecting up to 4% of women and characterised by amenorrhea with elevated gonadotropin before the age of 40. Oocytes require controlled DNA breakage and repair for homologous recombination and the maintenance of oocyte integrity. Biallelic disruption of the DNA damage repair gene, Fanconi anemia complementation group A (FANCA), is a common cause of Fanconi anaemia, a syndrome characterised by bone marrow failure, cancer predisposition, physical anomalies and POI. There is ongoing dispute about the role of heterozygous FANCA variants in POI pathogenesis, with insufficient evidence supporting causation. Here, we have identified biallelic FANCA variants in French sisters presenting with POI, including a novel missense variant of uncertain significance and a likely pathogenic deletion that initially evaded detection. Functional studies indicated no discernible effect on DNA damage sensitivity in patient lymphoblasts. These novel FANCA variants add evidence that heterozygous loss of one allele is insufficient to cause DNA damage sensitivity and POI. We propose that intragenic deletions, that are relatively common in FANCA, may be missed without careful analysis, and could explain the presumed causation of heterozygous variants. Accurate variant curation is critical to optimise patient care and outcomes.",['Tucker EJ; Sharp MF; Lokchine A; Bell KM; Palmer CS; Kline BL; Robevska G; van den Bergen J; Dulon J; Stojanovski D; Ayers KL; Touraine P; Crismani W; Jaillard S; Sinclair AH'],2024,ovarian insufficiency is a common form of female infertility. 4% of women are infertile and require controlled DNA breakage. there is ongoing dispute about the role of heterozygous FANCA variants in POI pathogenesis.
Insulin Sensitivity of Adipocytes is Improved by Pomegranate Mesocarp Through Reduced Oxidative Stress and Inflammation.,"Inflammatory phenomena and increase in oxidative stress in cell physiopathology progression render therapeutic strategies based on nutritional antioxidants necessary. It was thus aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the pomegranate mesocarp extract (PME) on differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes in the presence/absence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), a model mimicking insulin resistance. The effect of PME on lipid accumulation, protein expression of antioxidant, inflammatory and adipogenic biomarkers, reactive oxygen species production, activity of antioxidant enzymes and secretion of IL-6 has been evaluated during the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes, in the presence or absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reduced the expression of the regulator of insulin sensitivity PPARγ and suppressed adipocyte differentiation. PME counteracted the effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The latter induced a higher level of fat accumulation by promoting the expressions of the adipogenic markers PPARγ, C/EBPα, FABP4 and CD36 as compared to the control and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated differentiating cells. During the progression of adipogenesis, highest increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in IL-6 secretion, by 3.16 and 3.85 folds, was observed on day 2 of differentiation in control and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, respectively, compared to day 0. PME significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < 0.01) the secretion of the cytokine in addition to suppressing the expression of NFκB. PME also prevented the reduction of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities that occurred during adipogenesis, by at most 33%, 119% and 42%, respectively. These findings indicate that PME efficiently improves insulin sensitivity and can significantly counteract oxidative stress and inflammation.",['Ramlagan P; Rondeau P; Bourdon E; Bahorun T; Neergheen VS'],2024,pomegranate mesocarp extract (PME) was a model mimicking insulin resistance. it was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the pomegranate mesocarp extract.
Untargeted metabolomics in gastric and colorectal cancer patients - preliminary results.,"Recent years, microbiota-associated aspects have been analysed in multiple disorders regarding cancers. Existing evidence pints that gut microorganisms might take part in tumour origin and therapy efficacy. Nevertheless, to date, data on faecal metabolomics in cancer patients is still strongly limited. Therefore, we aimed to analyse gut untargeted metabolome in gastrointestinal cancer patients (i.e., gastric and colorectal cancer). There were 12 patients with either gastric (n=4) or colorectal cancer (n=8) enrolled and 8 analysed (n=4 each). Stool samples were collected prior to anti-cancer treatments. Untargeted metabolomics analyses were conducted by means of mass spectrometry. A plethora of metabolites in cancer patients we analysed were noted, with higher homogenity in case of gastric cancer patients. We found that the level of Deoxyguanosine,m/z 266.091,[M-H]-, Uridine,m/z 245.075,[M+H]+, Deoxyguanosine,m/z 268.104,[M]+, 3-Indoleacetic acid,m/z 176.07,[M+H]+, Indoxyl,m/z 132.031,[M-H]-, L-Phenylalanine,m/z 164.073,[M-H]-, L-Methionine,m/z 150.058,[M+NH4]+, was significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients and Ethyl hydrogen malonate,m/z 133.031,[M+H]+ in gastric cancer.

Effects of clinical covariates on serum miRNA expression among women without ovarian cancer.,"Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) are potential biomarkers for ovarian cancer; however, many factors may influence miRNA expression. To understand potential confounders in miRNA analysis, we examined how sociodemographic factors and comorbidities, including known ovarian cancer risk factors, influence serum miRNA levels in women without ovarian cancer. Data from 1,576 women from the Mass General Brigham Biobank collected between 2012 and 2019, excluding subjects previously or subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer, were examined. Using a focused panel of 179 miRNA probes optimized for serum profiling, miRNA expression was measured by flow cytometry using the Abcam Fireplex® assay and correlated with subjects' electronic medical records. The study population broadly reflected the New England population. The median age of subjects was 49 years, 34% were current or prior smokers, 33% were obese (BMI >30kg/m2), 49% were postmenopausal, and 11% had undergone prior bilateral oophorectomy. Significant differences in miRNA expression were observed among ovarian risk factors such as age, obesity, menopause, BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations or breast cancer in family history. Additionally, miRNA expression was significantly altered by prior bilateral oophorectomy, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Other variables, such as smoking, parity, age at menarche, hormonal replacement therapy, oral contraception, breast, endometrial, or colon cancer, and diabetes were not associated with significant changes in the panel when corrected for multiple testing. Serum miRNA expression patterns are significantly affected by patient demographics, exposure history, and medical comorbidities.

Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology in Adolescents and Young Adults with Youth-Onset Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes: A Proof-of-Concept Study.,"Adult-onset diabetes increases one's risk of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the risk associated with youth-onset diabetes (Y-DM) remains underexplored. We quantified plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration and AD in participants with Y-DM from the SEARCH cohort at adolescence and young adulthood (Type 1, n = 25; Type 2, n = 25; 59% female; adolescence, age = 15 y/o [2.6]; adulthood, age = 27.4 y/o [2.2]), comparing them with controls (adolescence, n = 25, age = 14.8 y/o [2.7]; adulthood, n = 21, age = 24.9 y/o [2.8]). Plasma biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain protein (NfL), phosphorylated tau-181 (pTau181), and amyloid beta (Aβ40, Aβ42), were measured via Simoa. A subset of participants (n = 7; age = 27.5 y/o [5.7]) and six controls (age = 25.1 y/o [4.5]) underwent PET scans to quantify brain amyloid and tau densities in AD sensitive brain regions. Y-DM adolescents exhibited lower plasma levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and GFAP, and higher pTau181 compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.05), a pattern persisting into adulthood (<i>p</i> < 0.001). All biomarkers showed significant increases from adolescence to adulthood in Y-DM (<i>p</i> < 0.01), though no significant differences in brain amyloid or tau were noted between Y-DM and controls in adulthood.

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome among people living with human immunodeficiency virus in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) poses a significant clinical challenge for individuals living with HIV (PLHIV). In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), this condition is becoming a growing concern, owing to lifestyle changes and an increasingly aging population. Several SSA countries have reported on the prevalence of MetS. However, these estimates may be outdated because numerous recent studies have updated MetS prevalence among PLHIV in these countries. Moreover, prior research has focused on various study designs to report the pooled prevalence, which is a methodological limitation. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled estimates of MetS in PLHIV in SSA by addressing these gaps. We systematically searched Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Sciences, EMBASE, and PubMed/Medline for the prevalence of MetS and its subcomponents among people with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The estimated pooled prevalence was presented using a forest plot. Egger's and Begg's rank regression tests were used to assess evidence of publication bias. Twenty-five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria after review of the updated PRISMA guidelines.

Validation of the Safety and Efficacy of Apixaban as Postoperative Thromboembolism Prophylaxis for Patients with Gynecologic Malignancies.,"Venous thromboembolism is a preventable complication of gynecologic cancer surgery that leads to postoperative morbidity and mortality. This study compared apixaban with enoxaparin to identify whether apixaban had the same safety and efficacy for patients undergoing gynecologic cancer surgery. The study identified patients with a gynecologic malignancy who underwent surgery and were prescribed apixaban at discharge between June 2020 and April 2023. International Classification of Diseases 10 codes were used to identify patients who had a thromboembolism within 90 days or a bleeding event within 60 days after surgery. The rates of events for patients prescribed apixaban were compared with those for a historical cohort of patients who received enoxaparin. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables, and t tests were used to compare continuous variables. A logistic regression was performed to compare the odds of thromboembolism between the two groups. Baseline patient characteristics differed in terms of body mass index (BMI), race, route of surgery, and type of cancer. Of the 490 patients in the apixaban cohort, 12 (2.4%) had a thromboembolism compared with 3 (2.1%) of the 138 patients in the enoxaparin group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30-4.70; p > 0.999). The odds ratio was adjusted for BMI, age, and route of surgery. A bleeding event occurred for 1 (0.2%) of the 490 patients in the apixaban group and for 1 (0.7%) of the 138 patients in the enoxaparin group. This validation study showed that apixaban is a safe and effective method of postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The data provide support to previous data and guideline updates recommending the use of apixaban for postoperative prophylaxis.",['Floyd J; Porragas-Paseiro H; Nguyen C; Moroney MR; Mastroyannis S; Guntupalli SR'],2024,study compared apixaban with enoxaparin to identify if apixaban had the same safety and efficacy for patients undergoing gynecologic cancer surgery. the study identified patients with a gynecologic malignancy who underwent surgery and were prescribed apixaban at discharge between June 2020 and April 2023.
Monocytes in type 1 diabetes families exhibit high cytolytic activity and subset abundances that correlate with clinical progression.,"Monocytes are immune regulators implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease that targets insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. We determined that monocytes of recent onset (RO) T1D patients and their healthy siblings express proinflammatory/cytolytic transcriptomes and hypersecrete cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide exposure compared to unrelated healthy controls (uHCs). Flow cytometry measured elevated circulating abundances of intermediate monocytes and >2-fold more CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>HLADR<sup>+</sup>KLRD1<sup>+</sup>PRF1<sup>+</sup> NK-like monocytes among patients with ROT1D compared to uHC. The intermediate to nonclassical monocyte ratio among ROT1D patients correlated with the decline in functional β cell mass during the first 24 months after onset. Among sibling nonprogressors, temporal decreases were measured in the intermediate to nonclassical monocyte ratio and NK-like monocyte abundances; these changes coincided with increases in activated regulatory T cells. In contrast, these monocyte populations exhibited stability among T1D progressors. This study associates heightened monocyte proinflammatory/cytolytic activity with T1D susceptibility and progression and offers insight to the age-dependent decline in T1D susceptibility.",['Pant T; Lin CW; Bedrat A; Jia S; Roethle MF; Truchan NA; Ciecko AE; Chen YG; Hessner MJ'],2024,monocytes of recent onset (RO) patients express proinflammatory/cytolytic transcriptomes. monocytes express hypersecrete cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide exposure. uHCs are unrelated to healthy controls.
Biocompatible cellulose nanocrystal-based Trojan horse enables targeted delivery of nano-Au radiosensitizers to triple negative breast cancer cells.,"A hybrid cellulose-based programmable nanoplatform for applications in precision radiation oncology is described. Here, sugar heads work as tumor targeting moieties and steer the precise delivery of radiosensitizers, <i>i.e.</i> gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This ""Trojan horse"" approach promotes a specific and massive accumulation of radiosensitizers in TNBC cells, thus avoiding the fast turnover of small-sized AuNPs and the need for high doses of AuNPs for treatment. Application of X-rays resulted in a significant increase of the therapeutic effect while delivering the same dose, showing the possibility to use roughly half dose of X-rays to obtain the same radiotoxicity effect. These data suggest that this hybrid nanoplatform acts as a promising tool for applications in enhancing cancer radiotherapy effects with lower doses of X-rays.",['Biagiotti G; Cazzoli R; Andreozzi P; Aresta G; Francesco M; Mangini C; di Gianvincenzo P; Tobia C; Recchia S; Polito L; Severi M; Vittorio O; Cicchi S; Moya SE; Ronca R; Albini A; Berti D; Orecchia R; Garibaldi C; Minucci S; Richichi B'],2024,a hybrid cellulose-based nanoplatform is described. it is used to steer the precise delivery of radiosensitizers into triple negative breast cancer cells. this approach promotes a specific and massive accumulation of radiosensitizers in TNBC cells.
"Comparison of Acute Toxicities, Overall Treatment Time and Quality of Life in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated with IMRT and Helical Tomotherapy.","Technical innovations in radiation therapy treatment planning and delivery over the last two decades have changed the practice of radiation therapy dramatically. The benefit of improved dose homogeneity and better sparing of critical structures in helical tomotherapy compared with conventional linac-based IMRT has been reported. This study was conducted to compare acute toxicities (skin, mucous membrane, salivary gland and hematological) during treatment and overall treatment time in Head and Neck Cancer patients treated with IMRT and Helical Tomotherapy and to assess the quality of life of patients during treatment between two groups. The study involved thirty patients with histologically proven Squamous cell carcinomas of Head and Neck. They were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, to a dose of 60-70 Gray in 30-35 fractions. The study consists of 2 arms which are standard IMRT and Tomotherapy arm. Fifteen consecutive patients were treated under IMRT and 15 patients were treated under Helical tomotherapy, along with concurrent chemotherapy. After completion of planning, plans were evaluated and dose to the targets, organs at risk were tabulated. Patients were assessed weekly for acute toxicities (skin reactions, mucositis, xerostomia, haematological toxicities) during the course of the treatment as per RTOG criteria. Quality of life of patients were assessed using FACT/ NCCN HNSI questionnaire in local language at day 1, day 21 and at completion of radiotherapy. Grade 2-3 skin reactions, mucositis, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were predominant in both arms. Treatment time from start of radiotherapy to completion of radiotherapy varied from 39 days to 68 days. Majority of patients completed radiotherapy within 50-56 days. Mean quality of life score did not show much difference between IMRT and tomotherapy arms. The study did not show any statistically significant difference in overall treatment time, acute toxicities- skin reactions, xerostomia, mucositis& hematological toxicities and quality of life of patients during radiotherapy between IMRT and Helical Tomotherapy. Dosimetric benefits of Tomotherapy over IMRT do not translate into clinical benefit in terms of reduced acute toxicities, lesser overall treatment time and better quality of life of patients.

circ_0000592 facilitates the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via miR-155-5p/FZD5 axis.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the gastrointestinal malignancies with high prevalence and poor prognosis. Previous reports suggested that circular ribose nucleic acids might exert regulatory functions in ESCC. This study aims to explore the role of circ_0000592 in ESCC progression, providing novel insights into the diagnosis and therapeutic avenues for ESCC. The GSE131969 data set was utilized to assess circ_0000592 expression in ESCC. The validation was performed in the tumorous tissues of ESCC patients (n = 80) and human-immortalized ESCC cell lines. The correlation between circ_0000592 expression and prognosis was analyzed. The impact of circ_0000592 on ESCC cell activity was evaluated through downregulating circ_0000592, as well as encompassing cell viability, migration, and invasion abilities. The downstream pathway of circ_0000592 was explored by binding site prediction from the TargetScan database, followed by in vitro and in vivo experiments. An in vivo xenograft tumor model was established to highlight the role of circ_0000592 in ESCC. Patients with ESCC exhibited higher circ_0000592 expression levels compared to noncancerous patients, which were associated with reduced survival time, higher TNM stage, and increased lymph node metastasis. The circ_0000592 downregulation suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion abilities in vitro. Mechanistically, circ_0000592 countered the inhibitory effects on the target gene Frizzled 5 (FZD5) through interactions with miR-155-5p. The overexpression of miR-155-5p curtailed the luciferase activity of circ_0000592 in ESCC cells, inhibiting downstream molecule FZD5 protein expression and subsequently mitigating the detrimental consequences of escalated circ_0000592 expression in ESCC cells. Consistently, circ_0000592 downregulation curbed proliferation and metastasis of ESCC tumors in vivo. In summary, circ_0000592 promoted the progress of ESCC by counteracting the inhibitory impact on FZD5 through its interaction with miR-155-5p. Together, our findings highlighted circ_0000592 as a prospective therapeutic target for ESCC.",['He J; Yu K; Liang G; Shen W; Tian H'],2024,"circ_0000592 expression suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion abilities. circ_0000592 downregulation suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion abilities in vitro."
Clinical application of immunogenic cell death inducers in cancer immunotherapy: turning cold tumors hot.,"Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising cancer treatment option in recent years. In immune ""hot"" tumors, characterized by abundant immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy can improve patients' prognosis by activating the function of immune cells. By contrast, immune ""cold"" tumors are often less sensitive to immunotherapy owing to low immunogenicity of tumor cells, an immune inhibitory tumor microenvironment, and a series of immune-escape mechanisms. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a promising cellular process to facilitate the transformation of immune ""cold"" tumors to immune ""hot"" tumors by eliciting innate and adaptive immune responses through the release of (or exposure to) damage-related molecular patterns. Accumulating evidence suggests that various traditional therapies can induce ICD, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. In this review, we summarize the biological mechanisms and hallmarks of ICD and introduce some newly discovered and technologically innovative inducers that activate the immune system at the molecular level. Furthermore, we also discuss the clinical applications of combing ICD inducers with cancer immunotherapy. This review will provide valuable insights into the future development of ICD-related combination therapeutics and potential management for ""cold"" tumors.",['Han Y; Tian X; Zhai J; Zhang Z'],2024,"immunotherapy can improve patients' prognosis by activating the function of immune cells. immunotherapy is a promising cellular process to facilitate the transformation of immune ""cold"" tumors to immune ""hot"" tumors."
Hyperandrogenism and Hypokalemic Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis in a North American Adolescent Girl.,"We present a unique case of hypokalemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) in an adolescent girl in North America. TPP is a rare but dangerous complication seen in thyrotoxic patients characterized by hypokalemia and acute proximal symmetric lower-extremity weakness. It is an especially rare phenomenon in pediatrics, with roughly 20 case reports described in adolescents worldwide; the majority are male. Our patient is a 14-year-old Asian girl with biochemical hyperandrogenism and known Graves disease who presented with an acute episode of lower-extremity weakness after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal. Laboratory workup revealed hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, an undetectable thyrotropin, and hyperthyroxinemia. Electrolyte derangements responded well to supplementation, and the muscle weakness resolved with electrolyte normalization. Following improvement in thyroid function, the patient underwent thyroidectomy for definitive management of Graves disease. As TPP is potentially exacerbated by higher androgen and insulin levels, we suspect that with increasing rates of obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome, the incidence of TPP among adolescents may increase. It is therefore critically important that there is awareness and recognition of this serious diagnosis among all health care providers.",['Gladding A; Bartoletti J; Iyer P; Dabrowski E'],2024,a 14-year-old girl with biochemical hyperandrogenism presented with an acute episode of lower-extremity weakness after eating a carbohydrate-rich meal. the patient underwent thyroidectomy for definitive management of Graves disease.
Drawing lines in the sand: The growing threat of obesity in type 1 diabetes.,"In this editorial, we comment on the article by Zeng <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> in 2024. We focus on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical interplay between obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies and people with T1DM could not be an exception to this rule. Chronic exogenous insulin administration, genetic and epigenetic factors, and psy-chosocial and behavioral parameters, along with the modern way of life that incorporates unhealthy eating patterns and physical inactivity, set the stage for the increasing obesity rates in T1DM. As our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms that lead to the development of obesity and hyperglycemia expands, it becomes clear that there are overlap zones in the pathophysiology of the two main types of diabetes. Stereotypes regarding strict dividing lines between ""autoimmune"" and ""metabolic"" phenotypes increase the risk of trapping physicians into ineffective therapeutic approaches, instead of individualized diabetes care. In this context, the use of adjuncts to insulin therapy that have the potential to alleviate cardiorenal risk and decrease body weight can reduce the burden of obesity in patients with T1DM.",['Koufakis T; Patoulias D; Zografou I; Papanas N; Popovic DS'],2024,"a new article by Zeng i>et al focuses on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical interplay between obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus. overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies. overweight and obesity represent a growing threat for modern societies."
Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) for sentinel lymph node detection in vulvar cancer.,"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles has been widely studied and standardized for breast and prostate cancer, but there is scarce evidence concerning its use in vulvar cancer. The objective of this study was to compare SLN detection using a SPIO tracer injected at the time of the surgery detected by a magnetometer, with the standard procedure of using a technetium 99 radioisotope (Tc99) detected by a gamma probe, in patients with vulvar cancer. The SPIO vulvar cancer study was a single-center prospective interventional non-inferiority study of SPIO compared to Tc99, conducted between 2016 and 2021 in patients who met the GROINSS-V study inclusion criteria for selective sentinel lymph node dissection in vulvar cancer. We included 18 patients and a total of 41 SLNs. The level of agreement between tracers was 92.7% (80.6%-97.4%), corresponding to 38 out of 41 SLNs, which confirms the non-inferiority of SPIO compared to Tc99. The SLN detection rate per groin was 96.3 (81.7%-99.3) using Tc99 and 100% (87.5%-100%) using SPIO. Both tracers had a detection rate of 100% for positive lymph nodes. The use of SPIO as a tracer for detecting SLNs in patients with vulvar cancer has shown to be non-inferior to that of the standard radiotracer, with the advantages of not requiring nuclear medicine and being able to inject it at the time of surgery after induction of anesthesia.",['Del Valle D; Ruiz R; Lekuona A; Cobas P; Jaunarena I; Gorostidi M; Cespedes J'],2024,tracers used a spython tracer to detect SLNs in patients with vulvar cancer. the tracers used a gamma probe to detect SLNs in patients with vulvar cancer. the tracers used a spython tracer to detect SLNs.
"SR proteins in cancer: function, regulation, and small inhibitor.","Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a fundamental step in RNA processing required for gene expression in most metazoans. Serine and arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) comprise a family of multifunctional proteins that contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the ultra-conserved arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain, and play an important role in precise alternative splicing. Increasing research supports SR proteins as also functioning in other RNA-processing-related mechanisms, such as polyadenylation, degradation, and translation. In addition, SR proteins interact with N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) regulators to modulate the methylation of ncRNA and mRNA. Dysregulation of SR proteins causes the disruption of cell differentiation and contributes to cancer progression. Here, we review the distinct biological characteristics of SR proteins and their known functional mechanisms during carcinogenesis. We also summarize the current inhibitors that directly target SR proteins and could ultimately turn SR proteins into actionable therapeutic targets in cancer therapy.",['Bei M; Xu J'],2024,SR proteins are a family of multifunctional proteins that contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and the ultra-conserved arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain.

The effect of diabetes mellitus on perioperative outcomes after colorectal resection: a national cohort study.,"Diabetes mellitus is a significant modulator of postoperative outcomes and is an important risk factor in the patient selection process. We aimed to investigate the effect of diabetes mellitus and use of insulin on outcomes after colorectal resection using a national cohort. Adults with a recorded colorectal resection in England between 2010 and 2020 were identified from Hospital Episode Statistics data linked to the Clinical Practice Research Database. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay (LOS) and readmission within 90 days. Of the 106 139 (52 875, 49.8% male) patients included, diabetes mellitus was prevalent in 10 931 (10.3%), 2145 (19.6%) of whom had a record of use of insulin. Unadjusted 90-day mortality risk was 5.7%, with an increased adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for people with diabetes mellitus (aHR 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.37, P<0.001). This risk was higher in both people with diabetes using insulin (aHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.31-1.74, P<0.001) and not using insulin (aHR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.33, P<0.001), compared with those without diabetes. Ninety-day readmission occurred in 20 542 (19.4%) patients and this was more likely in those with diabetes mellitus (aHR 1.23, 95% CI 1.18-1.29, P<0.001). Median (inter-quartile range) LOS was 8 (5-15) days and was higher in people with diabetes mellitus (adjusted time ratio 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.11, P<0.001).

Hierarchical and scaffolded phosphorylation of two degrons controls PER2 stability.,"The duration of the transcription-repression cycles that give rise to mammalian circadian rhythms is largely determined by the stability of the PERIOD protein, the rate-limiting components of the molecular clock. The degradation of PERs is tightly regulated by multisite phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 1 (CK1δ/ε). In this phosphoswitch, phosphorylation of a PER2 degron (Degron 2, D2) causes degradation, while phosphorylation of the PER2 Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) domain blocks CK1 activity on the degron, stabilizing PER2. However, this model and many other studies of PER2 degradation do not include the second degron of PER2 that is conserved in PER1, termed Degron 1, D1. We examined how these two degrons contribute to PER2 stability, affect the balance of the phosphoswitch, and how they are differentiated by CK1. Using PER2-luciferase fusions and real-time luminometry, we investigated the contribution of both D2 and of CK1-PER2 binding. We find that D1, like D2, is a substrate of CK1 but that D1 plays only a 'backup' role in PER2 degradation. Notably, CK1 bound to a PER1:PER2 dimer protein can phosphorylate PER1 D1 in trans. This scaffolded phosphorylation provides additional levels of control to PER stability and circadian rhythms.",['Francisco JC; Virshup DM'],2024,"degradation of PERs is tightly regulated by multisite phosphorylation by Casein Kinase 1 (CK1/) in this phosphoswitch, phosphorylation of a PER2 degron causes degradation, while phosphorylation of the PER2 Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) domain blocks CK1 activity on the degron, stabilizing PER2."
A novel radiomics-based technique for identifying vulnerable coronary plaques: a follow-up study.,"Previous reports have suggested that coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based radiomics analysis is a potentially helpful tool for assessing vulnerable plaques. We aimed to investigate whether coronary radiomic analysis of CCTA images could identify vulnerable plaques in patients with stable angina pectoris. This retrospective study included patients initially diagnosed with stable angina pectoris. Patients were randomly divided into either the training or test dataset at an 8 : 2 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from CCTA images. Radiomics models for predicting vulnerable plaques were developed using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC); the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to compare the diagnostic performance using the two cohorts. A total of 158 patients were included in the analysis. The SVM radiomics model performed well in predicting vulnerable plaques, with AUC values of 0.977 and 0.875 for the training and test cohorts, respectively.

[Radiotherapy for non-tumoral disorders : a brief history and indications in 2024].,"Radiotherapy for non-tumoral disorders has a long history. Lack of high-level evidence, therapeutic alternatives and fear of side effects (particularly radiation-induced cancer) reduced some indications to a trickle during the second half of the 20th century. Others were logically abandoned. There are two exceptions to this trend. On the one hand, some Central European countries (Germany in particular) still use radiotherapy regularly for diseases such as osteoarthritis, plantar fasciitis, chronic tendinopathies, Dupuytren's disease, etc. On the other hand, the development of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy has opened up new indications, whether cerebral (arteriovenous malformations, trigeminal neuralgia, obsessive-compulsive disorders) or cardiac (ventricular tachycardia).

DESI-MSI-guided exploration of metabolic-phenotypic relationships reveals a correlation between PI 38:3 and proliferating cells in clear cell renal cell carcinoma via single-section co-registration of multimodal imaging.,"A workflow has been evaluated that utilizes a single tissue section to obtain spatially co-registered, molecular, and phenotypical information suitable for AI-enabled image analysis. Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) was used to obtain molecular information followed by conventional histological staining and immunolabelling. The impact of varying DESI-MSI conditions (e.g., heated transfer line (HTL) temperature, scan rate, acquisition time) on the detection of small molecules and lipids as well as on tissue integrity crucial for integration into typical clinical pathology workflows was assessed in human kidney. Increasing the heated transfer line temperature from 150 to 450 °C resulted in a 1.8-fold enhancement in lipid signal at a scan rate of 10 scans/s, while preserving histological features. Moreover, increasing the acquisition speed to 30 scans/s yielded superior lipid signal when compared to 10 scans/s at 150 °C. Tissue morphology and protein epitopes remained intact allowing full histological assessment and further multiplex phenotyping by immunofluorescence (mIF) and immunohistochemistry (mIHC) of the same section. The successful integration of the workflow incorporating DESI-MSI, H&E, and immunolabelling on a single tissue section revealed an accumulation of ascorbic acid in regions of focal chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate within non-cancerous kidney tissue. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between PI 38:3 and proliferating cells was observed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) showing the utility of this approach in uncovering molecular associations in disease pathology.",['Zickuhr GM; Um IH; Laird A; Harrison DJ; Dickson AL'],2024,"a single tissue section was used to obtain molecular, molecular, and phenotypical information. the resulting workflow was evaluated in human kidney."
Targeted PLK1 suppression through RNA interference mediated by high-fidelity Cas13d mitigates osteosarcoma progression via TGF-β/Smad3 signalling.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents. Overexpression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is frequent in osteosarcoma and drives disease progression and metastasis, making it a promising therapeutic target. In this study, we explored PLK1 knockdown in osteosarcoma cells using RNA interference mediated by high-fidelity Cas13d (hfCas13d). PLK1 was found to be significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma tumour tissues compared to normal bone. sgRNA-mediated PLK1 suppression via hfCas13d transfection inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis, reduced cell invasion and increased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Proximity labelling by TurboID coupled with co-immunoprecipitation identified novel PLK1 interactions with Smad3, a key intracellular transducer of TGF-β signalling. PLK1 knockdown impaired Smad2/3 phosphorylation and modulated TGF-β/Smad3 pathway inactivation. Finally, in vivo delivery of hfCas13d vectors targeting PLK1 substantially attenuated osteosarcoma xenograft growth in nude mice. Taken together, this study highlights PLK1 as a potential therapeutic target and driver of disease progression in osteosarcoma. It also demonstrates the utility of hfCas13d-mediated gene knockdown as a strategy for targeted therapy. Further optimization of PLK1 suppression approaches may ultimately improve clinical outcomes for osteosarcoma patients.",['Yuan Y; Cao D; Zhang A; Liu Z; Deng Z; Zhang S'],2024,osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents. overexpression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is frequent in osteosarcoma. this study highlights PLK1 as a potential therapeutic target.
Influence of relatively short-term culture on adult porcine islets for xenotransplantation.,"Porcine islet xenotransplantation is a promising therapy for severe diabetes mellitus. Maintenance of the quality and quantity of porcine islets is important for the success of this treatment. Here, we aimed to elucidate the influence of relatively short-term (14 days) culture on adult porcine islets isolated from three micro-minipigs (P111, P112 and P121). Morphological characteristics of islets changed little after 14 days of culture. The viability of cultured islets was also maintained at a high level (> 80%). Furthermore, cultured islets exhibited similar glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content at Day 14 were preserved comparing with Day 1, while the expressions of Ins, Gcg and Sst were attenuated at Day 14. Xenotransplantation using diabetic nude mice showed no normalization of blood glucose but increased levels of plasma porcine C-peptide after the transplantation of 14 day cultured porcine islets.

Ductal carcinoma in situ develops within clonal fields of mutant cells in morphologically normal ducts.,"Mutations are abundantly present in tissues of healthy individuals, including the breast epithelium. Yet it remains unknown whether mutant cells directly induce lesion formation or first spread, leading to a field of mutant cells that is predisposed towards lesion formation. To study the clonal and spatial relationships between morphologically normal breast epithelium adjacent to pre-cancerous lesions, we developed a three-dimensional (3D) imaging pipeline combined with spatially resolved genomics on archival, formalin-fixed breast tissue with the non-obligate breast cancer precursor ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Using this 3D image-guided characterization method, we built high-resolution spatial maps of DNA copy number aberration (CNA) profiles within the DCIS lesion and the surrounding normal mammary ducts. We show that the local heterogeneity within a DCIS lesion is limited. However, by mapping the CNA profiles back onto the 3D reconstructed ductal subtree, we find that in eight out of 16 cases the healthy epithelium adjacent to the DCIS lesions has overlapping structural variations with the CNA profile of the DCIS. Together, our study indicates that pre-malignant breast transformations frequently develop within mutant clonal fields of morphologically normal-looking ducts. © 2024 The Authors.

Nurses' self-regulation after engaging in end-of-life conversations with advanced cancer patients: a qualitative study.,"Self-regulation is crucial for nurses who engage in in-depth end-of-life conversations with advanced cancer patients, especially in cultural contexts featuring death taboos. An improved understanding of the self-regulation process of nurses can help them address negative emotions and promote self-growth more effectively. Therefore, this study aimed to explore nurses' self-regulation process after end-of-life conversations with advanced cancer patients. This study employed a descriptive, qualitative approach. Seventeen nurses from four hospitals and a hospice unit in mainland China were interviewed between September 2022 and June 2023. Data were collected through face-to-face semistructured interviews. A thematic analysis method was used to analyse the data following the guidance of regulatory focus theory. Three main themes were developed: self-regulation antecedents include personality, experience, and support; promotion or prevention is a possible self-regulation process for nurses; both self-exhaustion and self-growth may be the outcomes of self-regulation, as did seven subthemes. Personality tendencies, life experience, and perceived support may affect nurses' self-regulation, thereby affecting their self-regulation outcomes. Nurses exhibit different self-regulatory tendencies and self-regulation outcomes. The provision of peer support and counselling support to nurses is highly important with regard to achieving good self-regulation outcomes.",['Du J; An Z; Wang C; Yu L'],2024,self-regulation is crucial for nurses who engage in end-of-life conversations with advanced cancer patients. this study aimed to explore nurses' self-regulation process after end-of-life conversations with advanced cancer patients. seventeen nurses from four hospitals and a hospice unit in mainland china were interviewed between September 2022 and June 2023.
A novel gain-of-function phosphorylation site modulates PTPN22 inhibition of TCR signaling.,"Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is encoded by a major autoimmunity gene and is a known inhibitor of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and drug target for cancer immunotherapy. However, little is known about PTPN22 post-translational regulation. Here we characterize a phosphorylation site at Ser<sup>325</sup> situated C-terminal to the catalytic domain of PTPN22, and its roles in altering protein function. In human T cells, Ser<sup>325</sup> is phosphorylated by Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3) following TCR stimulation, which promotes its TCR-inhibitory activity. Signaling through the major TCR-dependent pathway under PTPN22 control was enhanced by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated suppression of Ser<sup>325</sup> phosphorylation and inhibited by mimicking it via glutamic acid substitution. Global phospho-mass spectrometry showed Ser<sup>325</sup> phosphorylation state alters downstream transcriptional activity through enrichment of Swi3p, Rsc8p and Moira (SWIRM) domain binding proteins, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed it differentially regulates the expression of chemokines and T cell activation pathways. Moreover, in vitro kinetic data suggest the modulation of activity depends on a cellular context. Finally, we begin to address the structural and mechanistic basis for the influence of Ser<sup>325</sup> phosphorylation on the protein's properties by Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (DX/MS) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In conclusion, this study explores the function of a novel phosphorylation site of PTPN22 that is involved in complex regulation of TCR signaling and provides details that might inform the future development of allosteric modulators of PTPN22. Significance statement The tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 serves as a negative regulator in T cells, and its phosphorylation is a major regulatory process for controlling its function. Here, we uncovered a novel phosphorylation site at Ser<sup>325</sup> on PTPN22 that allosterically regulates its activity leading to impaired TCR-dependent pathways. Biophysical methods identify multiple regions affected upon Ser<sup>325</sup> phosphorylation, which can be the basis for future mechanistic studies of PTPN22 activators or inhibitors.",['Zhuang C; Yang S; Gonzalez CG; Ainsworth RI; Li S; Kobayashi MT; Wierzbicki I; Rossitto LM; Wen Y; Peti W; Stanford SM; Gonzalez DJ; Murali R; Santelli E; Bottini N'],2024,"phosphorylation site at sersup>325/sup> situated C-terminal to the catalytic domain of PTPN22. phosphorylation state alters downstream transcriptional activity through enrichment of Swi3p, Rsc8p and Moira domain binding proteins."
PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway Mediated Autophagy in Oral Carcinoma - A Comprehensive Review.,"Oral cancer is the most heterogeneous cancer at clinical and histological levels. PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was identified as one of the most commonly modulated signals in oral cancer, which regulates major cellular and metabolic activity of the cell. Thus, various proteins of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were used as therapeutic targets for oral cancer, to design more specific drugs with less off-target toxicity. This review sheds light on the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and its role in controlling autophagy and associated apoptosis during the progression and metastasis of oral squamous type of malignancy (OSCC). In addition, we reviewed in detail the upstream activators and the downstream effectors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling as potential therapeutic targets for oral cancer treatment.",['Rajendran P; Sekar R; Dhayasankar PS; Ali EM; Abdelsalam SA; Balaraman S; Chellappan BV; Metwally AM; Abdallah BM'],2024,PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was identified as one of the most commonly modulated signals in oral cancer.

Decline in Smartphone-Assessed Physical Activity Level is Associated With Clinical Outcomes in Phase I/II Clinical Cancer Trials.,"A decline in physical function may be an early predictor for complications of cancer treatment. This study examined whether repeated objective smartphone measurements of physical activity and exercise capacity in patients with cancer are feasible during early-phase clinical trials (EPCTs) and whether a decline in physical function is associated with clinical outcomes. Physical activity (steps/day) and exercise capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) were measured with a smartphone before EPCT start (T0) and after 4 weeks (T1) and 8 weeks (T2). Univariable logistic regression analyzed associations between a decline in step count (≥20%), 6MWT distance (≥10%), or deterioration of ECOG performance status (PS) and trial discontinuation at 8 weeks and 90 days. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), adjusting for trial phase (I vs II), cancer type (hematologic malignancy vs solid tumor), and PS (0 vs ≥1). Among 117 included patients, valid step count and 6MWT measurements were available for 96.6% and 76.7% of patients at T0, 74.4% and 53.3% at T1, and 89.7% and 54.4% at T2, respectively. Patients experiencing step count decline between T0 and T1 had higher odds of trial discontinuation at 8 weeks (odds ratio, 8.67; 95% CI, 1.94-61.43), and decline between T1 and T2 was associated with discontinuation at 90 days (odds ratio, 5.20; 95% CI, 1.43-21.14). Step count decline was significantly associated with shorter PFS (hazard ratio, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.06-6.08) and OS (hazard ratio, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.26-4.23). Declines in 6MWT distance or deterioration in ECOG PS were not associated with trial discontinuation or survival. Repeated smartphone measurements of physical activity are feasible in patients participating in EPCTs. Additionally, physical activity decline is significantly associated with trial discontinuation, PFS, and OS. Hence, we envision that objective smartphone measurements of physical activity will contribute to optimal treatment development for patients with cancer.",['Brouwer CG; Douma JAJ; Kuip EJM; Zweegman S; van de Donk NWCJ; Hopman MTE; van Linde ME; Verheul HMW; Buffart LM'],2024,"physical activity (steps/day) and exercise capacity (6-minute walk test [6MWT]) were measured with a smartphone before EPCT start (T0) and after 4 weeks (T1) and 8 weeks (T2). a decline in step count (20%), 6MWT distance (10%), or deterioration of ECOG performance status (PS) and trial discontinuation at 8 weeks and 90 days."
FBXO32 Stimulates Protein Synthesis to Drive Pancreatic Cancer Progression and Metastasis.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, primarily due to its rapid progression. The current treatment options for PDAC are limited, and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for PDAC progression is required to identify improved therapeutic strategies. Here, we identified FBXO32 as an oncogenic driver in PDAC. FBXO32 was aberrantly upregulated in PDAC, and high FBXO32 expression was significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis in PDAC patients. FRG1 deficiency promoted FBXO32 upregulation in PDAC. FBXO32 promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, FBXO32 directly interacted with eEF1A1 and promoted its polyubiquitination at the K273 site, leading to enhanced activity of eEF1A1 and increased protein synthesis in PDAC cells. Moreover, FBXO32-catalyzed eEF1A1 ubiquitination boosted the translation of ITGB5 mRNA and activated FAK signaling, thereby facilitating focal adhesion assembly and driving PDAC progression. Importantly, interfering with the FBXO32-eEF1A1 axis or pharmaceutical inhibition of FAK by defactinib, an FDA-approved FAK inhibitor, substantially inhibited PDAC growth and metastasis driven by aberrantly activated FBXO32-eEF1A1 signaling. Overall, this study uncovers a mechanism by which PDAC cells rely on FBXO32-mediated eEF1A1 activation to drive progression and metastasis. FBXO32 may serve as a promising biomarker for selecting eligible PDAC patients for treatment with defactinib.",['Su D; Wang R; Chen G; Ding C; Liu Y; Tao J; Wang Y; Qiu J; Luo W; Weng G; Gang Y; Zhang T'],2024,FBXO32 was aberrantly upregulated in PDAC.

Antioxidant activity of Sophora exigua and liposome development of its powerful extract.,"Sophora exigua (SE) was sequentially extracted using hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol. The obtained extracts were tested for antioxidant activity. Among them, the fractionated ethyl acetate extract (SE-EA) showed the highest potential in free radical scavenging and ferric-reducing properties. The chemical analysis identified sophoraflavanone G as one of the active ingredients in SE-EA. According to SE-EA solubility, SE-EA liposomes were developed using a sonication-assisted thin film method. Cholesterol and phospholipids were used as the main compositions of the liposomes. The obtained liposomes were spherical with different nano-size ranges, size distribution, and zeta potential depending on SE-EA and total lipid concentrations. SE-EA liposomes were slightly bigger than their empty liposomes. All liposomes exhibited a phospholipid crystalline structure. Cholesterol and SE-EA existed in the liposomes as an amorphous state. SE-EA liposomes with high total lipid content exhibited high entrapment efficiency and sustained release behavior. Whereas liposomes with low total lipid content showed low entrapment efficiency and fast-release behavior. All SE-EA liposomes showed stronger antioxidant activity than the non-entrapped SE-EA. In conclusion, SE-EA is a natural source of potent antioxidants. The developed SE-EA liposomes are a promising pharmaceutical formulation to efficiently deliver the active ingredients of SE-EA and are suitable for further study in vivo.",['Rodwattanagul S; Sasarom M; Riangjanapatee P; Anuchapreeda S; Okonogi S'],2024,"hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol were tested for antioxidant activity. the fractionated ethyl acetate extract (SE-EA) showed the highest potential in free radical scavenging and ferric-reducing properties."
"The clinical significance of TAT, PIC, TM, and t-PAIC in vascular events of BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.","Predicting the likelihood vascular events in patients with BCR/ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is essential for the treatment of the disease. However, effective assessment methods are lacking. Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin-α<sub>2</sub>- plasmininhibitor complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), and tissue plasminogen activator-inhibitor complex (t-PAIC) are the new direct indicators for coagulation and fibrinolysis. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes of these four new indicators in thrombotic and hemorrhagic events in BCR/ABL1-negative MPN. The study cohort of 74 patients with BCR/ABL negative myeloproliferative disorders included essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). A panel of 4 biomarkers, including TAT, PIC, TM, and t-PAIC were determined using Sysmex HISCL5000 automated analyzers, whereas fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), D-dimer and Antithrombin III (ATIII) were analyzed using Sysmex CS5100 coagulation analyzer. A total of 24 (32.4%) patients experienced thrombotic events and hemorrhagic events occurred in 8 patients (10.8%). Compared to patients without hemorrhagic-thrombotic events, patients with thrombotic events had higher fibrinogen (FIB) level, FDP level and lower ATIII activity, while patients with hemorrhagic events had lower white blood cell count and hemoglobin level, higher FDP level (P < 0.05). Patients with a JAK2V617F mutation were more likely to experience thrombotic events (P < 0.05). In addtion, patients with thrombotic events had higher TAT, PIC, TM, and t-PAIC levels than patients without hemorrhagic-thrombotic events (P < 0.05), whereas patients with hemorrhagic events had a lower median value in TAT and TM (no statistical difference, P > 0.05). Patients with higher TAT, TM and t-PAIC were more likely to experience thrombotic events (P < 0.05), and only TAT was positively correlated with thrombotic events (Spearman  r =0.287, P = 0.019).

A Primary Care-Based Weight Navigation Program.,"Evidence-based weight management treatments (WMTs) are underused; strategies are needed to increase WMT use and patients' weight loss. To evaluate the association of a primary care-based weight navigation program (WNP) with WMT use and weight loss. This cohort study comprised a retrospective evaluation of a quality improvement program conducted from October 1, 2020, to September 30, 2021. Data analysis was performed from August 2, 2022, to March 7, 2024. Adults with obesity and 1 or more weight-related condition from intervention and control sites in a large academic health system in the Midwestern US were propensity matched on sociodemographic and clinical factors. WNP, in which American Board of Obesity Medicine-certified primary care physicians offered weight-focused visits and guided patients' selection of preference-sensitive WMTs. Primary outcomes were feasibility measures, including rates of referral to and engagement in the WNP. Secondary outcomes were mean weight loss, percentage of patients achieving 5% or more and 10% or more weight loss, referral to WMTs, and number of antiobesity medication prescriptions at 12 months. Of 264 patients, 181 (68.6%) were female and mean (SD) age was 49.5 (13.0) years; there were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between WNP patients (n = 132) and matched controls (n = 132). Of 1159 WNP-eligible patients, 219 (18.9%) were referred to the WNP and 132 (11.4%) completed a visit. In a difference-in-differences analysis, WNP patients lost 4.9 kg more than matched controls (95% CI, 2.11-7.76; P < .001), had 4.4% greater weight loss (95% CI, 2.2%-6.4%; P < .001), and were more likely to achieve 5% or more weight loss (odds ratio [OR], 2.90; 95% CI, 1.54-5.58); average marginal effects, 21.2%; 95% CI, 8.8%-33.6%) and 10% or more weight loss (OR, 7.19; 95% CI, 2.55-25.9; average marginal effects, 17.4%; 95% CI, 8.7%-26.2%).

Relationship between immune cells and diabetic nephropathy: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Although previous studies have suggested potential correlations between immunocytes and diabetic nephropathy (DN), the causal correlations between them remain unclarified. In this study, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to analyze the potential causative correlations between immune 731 cells and DN. We used the Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) database to aggregate signatures of immune cells and DN from European and East Asian populations. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used as instrumental variables. MR analysis was conducted using Mendelian randomization-Egger (MR-Egger) regression and the random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. A total of 3,571 SNPs were included as instrumental variables. The MR-Egger regression model indicated no genetic pleiotropy (P = 0.6284). The results of the IVW method indicated a statistically significant causal relationship between immune cell HLA-DR on CD14-CD16- (P = 0.029), CD45RA-CD28-CD8 + T cell% T cells (P = 0.0278), CD11c on myeloid dendritic cells (P = 0.0352), HLA-DR on CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes (P < 0.001), CD27 on CD24 + CD27 + B cells (P = 0.0334), CD27 on IgD + CD24 + B cells (P = 0.0137), CD4 on CD39 + CD4 + T cells (P = 0.0347), CD28 on CD39 + CD4 + T cells (P = 0.0414), CD39 on CD39 + CD4 + T cells (P = 0.0426), and DN. Additionally, there was no heterogeneity in SNPs related HLA-DR on CD14-CD16-cells and DN(I<sup>2</sup> = 32%, Cochran's Q = 2.9476, P = 0.2291).

Upregulation of collagen type X alpha 1 promotes the progress of triple-negative breast cancer via Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a malignant tumor with high degree of malignancy and lack of effective target treatment. The research aims to explore the role and mechanism of X collagen alpha-1 chain protein (COL10A1 gene) in TNBC. UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier were used to detect the expression of COL10A1 and its role in the prognosis of breast cancer patients. The cells with stably expressing high levels of COL10A1 were obtained by recombinant lentivirus infection. The expression of COL10A1 in cells was temporarily downregulated by siRNA interference fragments. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were utilized to detect the changes of COL10A1 mRNA and protein expression. The biological functions of the cells were evaluated by colony formation, cell counting kit-8, cell invasion and wound healing experiments. In addition, the effect of COL10A1 on angiogenesis was investigated by tube formation assay. Xenograft tumor model was used to confirm the effect of COL10A1 on tumorigenicity in vivo and multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry to detect multiple proteins simultaneously. The possible molecular mechanism of the function of COL10A1 was speculated through the detection of proteins in functionally related pathways. COL10A1 is highly expressed and is significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in TNBC. Overexpression of COL10A1 increased the clone formation rate and cell migration capacity of TNBC cells. In the COL10A1 overexpression group, the clone formation rates of MD-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (21.5 ± 0.62, 27.83 ± 3.72)% were significantly higher than those in the control group(15.23 ± 2.79, 19.4 ± 1.47)%, and the relative migration ratio (47.40 ± 3.09, 41.26 ± 4.33)% were higher than those in the control group (34.48 ± 2.03, 21.80 ± 1.03)%. When the expression of COL10A1 was downregulated, the ability of clone formation and wound-healing migration capacity in TNBC cells was weakened. Upregulated COL10A1 in TNBC cells generated more junctions and longer total segments between vascular endothelial cells, and promoted angiogenesis of the cells, and thus enhanced the tumorigenesis. In TNBC, it was found that COL10A1 might affect epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the cells through Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by the detection of the related pathway proteins. COL10A1 is highly expressed in TNBC, and its high expression leads to poor OS and RFS. COL10A1 may enhance TNBC cell proliferation, migration and tumor-related angiogenesis, and promote tumorigenesis in vivo via Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",['Peng J; Liu X; Mao Y; Lv M; Ma T; Liu J; Zhou Q; Han Y; Li X; Wang H'],2024,UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier were used to detect the expression of COL10A1. the cells with stably expressing high levels of COL10A1 were obtained by recombinant lentivirus infection. the expression of COL10A1 in cells was temporarily downregulated by siRNA interference fragments.

Assessing metabolic risk factors for psychiatric patients: An IT-supported task shift from physician to pharmacist.,"Psychiatric medication can have adverse effects such as weight gain, which is a metabolic risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This study aimed to assess whether an IT-supported task shift from physicians to pharmacists could improve clinical guideline compliance in assessing metabolic risk factors for psychiatric patients. An IT tool was designed and implemented in the electronic health record to enable pharmacists to efficiently screen patients for metabolic risk factors. The tool provided a risk score for each patient based on criteria from the cross-regional guideline. All admitted patients with a score were assessed by the pharmacists, who referred and discussed the patients with a physician when deemed relevant. We measured guideline compliance during baseline (manual screening) and intervention (automated screening) after implementing the IT tool and pharmacist assessment. After the intervention period, we conducted follow-up interviews with all participating pharmacists. Guideline compliance increased significantly from 26 % (baseline) to 63 % (intervention) (Fisher's exact test p < .001, N = 98). The task shift from physicians to pharmacists was also significant (Fisher's exact test, p < .001, N = 40). Interviews revealed that the pharmacists found the task shift meaningful and received positive feedback from the physicians. The facilitators of the task shift included interprofessional collaboration, physician shortage, provider empowerment, and the manageable nature of the task. The barriers included a need for further competence development and lack of pharmacist authorization. The IT tool was considered useful and suggestions for improvements emerged.

Integrating single-cell and spatial analysis reveals MUC1-mediated cellular crosstalk in mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma.,"Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma (MCA) is a distinct subtype of colorectal cancer (CRC) with the most aggressive pattern, but effective treatment of MCA remains a challenge due to its vague pathological characteristics. An in-depth understanding of transcriptional dynamics at the cellular level is critical for developing specialised MCA treatment strategies. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data to systematically profile the MCA tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly the interactome of stromal and immune cells. In addition, a three-dimensional bioprinting technique, canonical ex vivo co-culture system, and immunofluorescence staining were further applied to validate the cellular communication networks within the TME. This study identified the crucial intercellular interactions that engaged in MCA pathogenesis. We found the increased infiltration of FGF7<sup>+</sup>/THBS1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts in MCA tissues with decreased expression of genes associated with leukocyte-mediated immunity and T cell activation, suggesting a crucial role of these cells in regulating the immunosuppressive TME. In addition, MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> macrophages that exhibit M2-phenotype were enriched in the tumoral niche and high expression of MS4A4A<sup>+</sup> was associated with poor prognosis in the cohort data. The ligand-receptor-based intercellular communication analysis revealed the tight interaction of MUC1<sup>+</sup> malignant cells and ZEB1<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells, providing mechanistic information for MCA angiogenesis and molecular targets for subsequent translational applications.

In Vitro Glucose Measurement from NIR and MIR Spectroscopy: Comprehensive Benchmark of Machine Learning and Filtering Chemometrics.,"The quantitative analysis of glucose using spectroscopy is a topic of great significance and interest in science and industry. One conundrum in this area is deploying appropriate preprocessing and regression tools. To contribute to addressing this challenge, in this study, we conducted a comprehensive and novel comparative analysis of various machine learning and preprocessing filtering techniques applied to near-infrared, mid-infrared, and a combination of near-infrared and mid-infrared spectroscopy for glucose assay. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in accurately predicting glucose levels and to determine which approach was most optimal. Our investigation involved the acquisition of spectral data from samples of glucose solutions using the three aforementioned spectroscopy techniques. The data was subjected to several preprocessing filtering methods, including convolutional moving average, Savitzky-Golay, multiplicative scatter correction, and normalisation. We then applied representative machine learning algorithms from three categories: linear modelling, traditional nonlinear modelling, and artificial neural networks. The evaluation results revealed that linear models exhibited higher predictive accuracy than nonlinear models, whereas artificial neural network models demonstrated comparable performance. Additionally, the comparative analysis of various filtering methods demonstrated that the convolutional moving average and Savitzky-Golay filters yielded the most precise outcomes overall. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of different machine learning techniques for glucose measurement and highlights the importance of applying appropriate filtering methods in enhancing predictive accuracy. These findings have important implications for the development of new and improved glucose quantification technologies.",['Khadem H; Nemat H; Elliott J; Benaissa M'],2024,spectroscopy is a topic of great significance and interest in science and industry. we conducted a comprehensive and novel comparative analysis of various machine learning and preprocessing filtering techniques. the results have important implications for the development of new technologies.
Identification and validation of a novel risk model based on cuproptosis‑associated m6A for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a prevalent cancer with a poor survival rate due to anatomical limitations of the head and a lack of reliable biomarkers. Cuproptosis represents a novel cellular regulated death pathway, and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal RNA modification in mRNA. They are intricately connected to tumor formation, progression, and prognosis. This study aimed to construct a risk model for HNSCC using a set of mRNAs associated with m6A regulators and cuproptosis genes (mcrmRNA). RNA-seq and clinical data of HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed to develop a risk model through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed for the high- and low-risk groups. Additionally, the model was validated using the GSE41613 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GSEA and CIBERSORT were applied to investigate the immune microenvironment of HNSCC. A risk model consisting of 32 mcrmRNA was developed using the LASSO analysis. The risk score of patients was confirmed to be an independent prognostic indicator by multivariate Cox analysis. The high-risk group exhibited a higher tumor mutation burden. Additionally, CIBERSORT analysis indicated varying levels of immune cell infiltration between the two groups. Significant disparities in drug sensitivity to common medications were also observed. Enrichment analysis further unveiled significant differences in metabolic pathways and RNA processing between the two groups. Our risk model can predict outcomes for HNSCC patients and offers valuable insights for personalized therapeutic approaches.",['Xing Z; Xu Y; Xu X; Yang K; Qin S; Jiao Y; Wang L'],2024,"mcrmRNAs are intricately connected to tumor formation, progression, and prognosis. a risk model was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis."
Systematic investigation of <i>Radix Salviae</i> for treating diabetic peripheral neuropathy disease based on network Pharmacology.,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a debilitating complication of diabetes mellitus with limited available treatment options. <i>Radix Salviae</i>, a traditional Chinese herb, has shown promise in treating DPN, but its therapeutic mech-anisms have not been systematically investigated. <i>Radix Salviae</i> (Danshen in pinin), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is widely used to treat DPN in China. However, the mechanism through which <i>Radix Salviae</i> treats DPN remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to explore the mechanism of action of <i>Radix Salviae</i> against DPN using network pharmacology. The active ingredients and target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened using the TCM pharmacology database and analysis platform. The genes associated with DPN were obtained from the Gene Cards and OMIM databases, a drug-com-position-target-disease network was constructed, and a protein-protein inter-action network was subsequently constructed to screen the main targets. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis were performed <i>via</i> the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) using Bioconductor. A total of 56 effective components, 108 targets and 4581 DPN-related target genes of <i>Radix Salviae</i> were screened. Intervention with <i>Radix Salviae</i> for DPN mainly involved 81 target genes. The top 30 major targets were selected for enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG pathways. These results suggested that <i>Radix Salviae</i> could treat DPN by regulating the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, Danshen may affect DPN by regulating inflammation and apoptosis.",['Kang T; Qin X; Chen Y; Yang Q'],2024,traditional Chinese herb has shown promise in treating diabetes mellitus. but therapeutic mech-anisms have not been systematically investigated. i>Radix Salviae/i> (Danshen in pinin) is widely used to treat DPN in china.
A Case of Acromegaly With Progressed Diabetic Retinopathy and Sarcopenia Diagnosed Following the Onset of Severe Hypoglycemia.,"Acromegaly is a rare disorder characterized by excessive production of growth hormone (GH) from a pituitary tumor, typically leading to elevated glucose levels due to increased insulin resistance; hypoglycemia is rare. However, the long-term effect of excess GH on the peripheral organs is still unclear. Here we present a 69-year-old man evaluated for the cause of a hypoglycemic episode. He was underweight (body mass index: 17.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with sarcopenia, which potentially contributed to his hypoglycemia. Notably, he exhibited progressed proliferative diabetic retinopathy compared to other microvascular complications, leading to further endocrinological investigation. As a result, he was diagnosed with acromegaly showing elevated GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) with a pituitary tumor. Opting against transsphenoidal surgery (TSS), the patient was treated with a somatostatin analog (SSA), achieving normalized IGF-1 levels with a monthly 120 mg lanreotide injection. In this case, acromegaly could lead to sarcopenia from GH-derived gluconeogenesis in the peripheral organs such as the reduction of muscle leading to reduced glucose reserves. Acromegaly in the elderly may present atypicality. Clinicians should be vigilant for unique manifestations such as advanced diabetic retinopathy, even in elderly patients with hypoglycemia.",['Kubo H; Sugimoto K; Wada R; Sekikawa N; Inoue M'],2024,a 69-year-old man was diagnosed with acromegaly showing elevated GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) with a pituitary tumor. he showed elevated GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) with a pituitary tumor. he was diagnosed with acromegaly showing elevated GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).
Modification of extracellular matrix proteins by oxidants and electrophiles.,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical to biological architecture and determines cellular properties, function and activity. In many situations it is highly abundant, with collagens and elastin being some of the most abundant proteins in mammals. The ECM comprises of multiple different protein species and sugar polymers, with both different isoforms and post-translational modifications (PTMs) providing a large variety of microenvironments that play a key role in determining tissue structure and health. A number of the PTMs (e.g. cross-links) present in the ECM are critical to integrity and function, whereas others are deleterious to both ECM structure and associated cells. Modifications induced by reactive oxidants and electrophiles have been reported to accumulate in some ECM with increasing age. This accumulation can be exacerbated by disease, and in particular those associated with acute or chronic inflammation, obesity and diabetes. This is likely to be due to higher fluxes of modifying agents in these conditions. In this focused review, the role and effects of oxidants and other electrophiles on ECM are discussed, with a particular focus on the artery wall and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Modifications generated on ECM components are reviewed, together with the effects of these species on cellular properties including adhesion, proliferation, migration, viability, metabolic activity, gene expression and phenotype. Increasing data indicates that ECM modifications are both prevalent in human and mammalian tissues and play an important role in disease development and progression.",['Yang-Jensen KC; Jørgensen SM; Chuang CY; Davies MJ'],2024,"the extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical to biological architecture and determines cellular properties, function and activity. the protein is highly abundant, with collagens and elastin being some of the most abundant proteins in mammals."
Exploring the Impact of Iron Deficiency Anaemia on Glycated Haemoglobin A1c Levels in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review.,"Haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) is fundamental in monitoring glycaemic control during pregnancy. However, several conditions could affect this test's accuracy, including iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). Hence, this systematic review delves into the underexplored connection between IDA, iron replacement therapy (IRT), and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) during pregnancy. An electronic search of the Cochrane, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted by six authors. From a comprehensive search strategy, 968 records were obtained. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven studies were included, comprising 365 women selected for analysis. Six studies indicated a positive correlation between IDA and HbA1c levels, while one found no correlation. The average HbA1c level of the included studies in pregnant women was 5.64%. In comparison, it was found that non-pregnant women had lower HbA1c levels. Among the included studies, the mean HbA1c levels decreased from 5.1% to 4.89% after treating pregnant women with IRT. The review emphasises the complexity of interpreting HbA1c levels in pregnant women with IDA, highlighting the influence of pregnancy-induced physiological changes. In addition, this suggests that HbA1c should not be the sole criterion for diabetes management in pregnant women with IDA. Future research should focus on alternative glycaemic monitoring methods unaffected by IDA.",['AlQarni AM; Alghamdi AA; Aljubran HJ; Bamalan OA; Abuzaid AH; AlYahya MA; AlAwami AM; Al Shubbar MD; Al Yousif GF'],2024,a systematic review of glycaemic control during pregnancy. a link between IDA and iron replacement therapy was found. six studies indicated a positive correlation between IDA and HbA1c levels.
Restoring adiponectin via rosiglitazone ameliorates tissue wasting in mice with lung cancer.,"To investigate systemic regulators of the cancer-associated cachexia syndrome (CACS) in a pre-clinical model for lung cancer with the goal to identify therapeutic targets for tissue wasting. Using the Kras/Lkb1 (KL) mouse model, we found that CACS is associated with white adipose tissue (WAT) dysfunction that directly affects skeletal muscle homeostasis. WAT transcriptomes showed evidence of reduced adipogenesis, and, in agreement, we found low levels of circulating adiponectin. To preserve adipogenesis and restore adiponectin levels, we treated mice with the PPAR-γ agonist, rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone treatment increased serum adiponectin levels, delayed weight loss, and preserved skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass, as compared to vehicle-treated mice. The preservation of muscle mass with rosiglitazone was associated with increases in AMPK and AKT activity. Similarly, activation of the adiponectin receptors in muscle cells increased AMPK activity, anabolic signaling, and protein synthesis. Our data suggest that PPAR-γ agonists may be a useful adjuvant therapy to preserve tissue mass in lung cancer.",['Langer HT; Ramsamooj S; Dantas E; Murthy A; Ahmed M; Ahmed T; Hwang SK; Grover R; Pozovskiy R; Liang RJ; Queiroz AL; Brown JC; White EP; Janowitz T; Goncalves MD'],2024,a pre-clinical model for lung cancer was used to investigate systemic regulators of the cancer-associated cachexia syndrome. the model was used to identify therapeutic targets for tissue wasting.
The burden of treatment of propranolol for infantile hemangiomas: A mixed methods study.,"The burden of treatment (BOT) related to propranolol treatment for infantile hemangiomas (IH) has never previously been explored. A modified validated questionnaire, the Treatment Burden Questionnaire, and one-on-one semi-structured interviews were used to assess the BOT for propranolol for IH. Out of 80 caregivers, the overall burden score was very low at 1.2 out of 10; thematic analysis of interviews grouped themes into administration, monitoring, financial, and associated anomalies. The BOT of propranolol for IH is very low but could be reduced further by offering age-based risk stratification related to feeding frequency and risk of hypoglycemia, pragmatic advice around timing of doses before sleep, and reducing frequency of vital sign monitoring.","[""O'Connor C; Murphy M""]",2024,burden of treatment (BOT) related to propranolol for IH has never been explored. a modified validated questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were used to assess the BOT for propranolol for IH. the overall burden score was very low at 1.2 out of 10.
Patients' and caregivers' perspective on challenges and outcomes with tube feeding: Analysis of home enteral nutrition survey data.,"Given the growing use of home enteral nutrition (HEN), assessing the experience of consumers and caregivers is crucial to understanding the real-world subjective and objective challenges of administering HEN. After obtaining institutional review board approval, a survey was distributed to HEN consumers and caregivers between January 16, 2020, and July 16, 2021. Data collected included information regarding demographics, primary diagnosis, tube and connectors, HEN regimen, and overall HEN experience. A total of 884 individuals responded to the survey: 673 (76.1%) responses by caregivers and 211 (23.9%) responses by patients. The study cohort included 566 (64%) children and 318 (36%) adults. The leading primary diagnosis of participants was developmental delay and motility disorder for children and adults, respectively. Low-profile gastric tubes were the most used (75.7% of children and 30.3% of adults). Notably, legacy connectors were utilized for more patients (46.7% children, 52.6% adults) compared to ISO-80369-3 connectors (38.9% children, 29.7% adults). HEN complications were prevalent, including enteral tube site infections and other tube-related complications, including clogging and kinking. This real-world data reveals that HEN complications remain prevalent. Additionally, despite introducing ISO-80369-3 connectors many years ago, most patients continue to use legacy tubes with a significant lack of knowledge about ISO-80369-3 connectors.

Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Carbon-Ion Radiation Therapy and Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Carbon-ion radiation therapy (CIRT) is a treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that results in better outcomes with fewer side effects despite its high cost. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CIRT for HCC from medical and economic perspectives by comparing CIRT and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with localized HCC who were ineligible for surgery or radiofrequency ablation. This study included 34 patients with HCC who underwent either CIRT or TACE at Gunma University between 2007 and 2016. Patient characteristics were employed to select each treatment group using the propensity score matching method. Life years were used as the outcome indicator. The CIRT technical fee was ¥3,140,000; however, a second CIRT treatment on the same organ within 2 years was performed for free. Our study showed that CIRT was dominant over TACE, as the CIRT group had a higher life year (point estimate, 2.75 vs 2.41) and lower total cost (mean, ¥4,974,278 vs ¥5,284,524). We conducted a sensitivity analysis to validate the results because of the higher variance in medical costs in the TACE group, which demonstrated that CIRT maintained its cost effectiveness with a high acceptability rate. CIRT is a cost-effective treatment option for localized HCC cases unsuitable for surgical resection.",['Okazaki S; Shibuya K; Shiba S; Takura T; Ohno T'],2024,carbon-ion radiation therapy (CIRT) is a treatment option for localized HCC cases. the treatment option is a cost-effective treatment option for localized cases. the study included 34 patients with HCC who underwent either CIRT or TACE.
"Evaluation of the combination of black rice bran ethanol extract and glimepiride in reducing blood glucose and protecting kidney, liver and pancreatic cells.","Long-lasting hyperglycemia can potentially cause damage to organs such as the kidneys, liver and pancreas.

Association of salivary testosterone levels during the post-awakening period with age and symptoms suggestive of late-onset hypogonadism in men.,"The lack of association between serum testosterone levels and symptoms suggestive of hypogonadism is a significant barrier in the determination of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) in men. This study explored whether testosterone levels increase after morning awakening, likewise the cortisol awakening response (CAR) in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and whether testosterone levels during the post-awakening period are associated with age and symptoms suggestive of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) in men. Testosterone and cortisol levels were determined in saliva samples collected immediately upon awakening and 30 and 60 min after awakening, and scores of the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) questionnaire were obtained from 225 healthy adult men. A typical CAR (an increase in cortisol level ≥ 2.5 nmol/L above individual baseline) was observed in 155 participants (the subgroup exhibiting typical CAR). In the subgroup exhibiting CAR, testosterone levels sharply increased during the post-awakening period, showing a significant negative correlation with age, total AMS score, and the scores of 11 items on the somatic, psychological, and sexual AMS subscales. Of these items, three sexual items (AMS items #15-17) were correlated with age. Meanwhile, there was no notable increase in testosterone levels and no significant correlation of testosterone levels with age and AMS score in the subgroup exhibiting no typical CAR (<i>n</i> = 70).

Foot self-care behaviour in primary care patients with diabetic foot ulcers: Structural equation modelling of psychological predictors.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are one of the most prevalent and costly diabetes complications, associated with diminished quality of life and poor prognosis. Management of DFUs relies heavily on patients' foot self-care behaviour. This study aims to explore psychological determinants of this important behaviour among primary care patients. A total of 186 patients with active DFUs self-reported their illness perception, diabetes distress, self-efficacy, and foot self-care behaviour. Structural equation modelling was performed to examine interrelationships among measured variables. The final model demonstrated satisfactory fit, CFI = 0.933, TLI = 0.913, RMSEA = 0.050, SRMR = 0.073, χ<sup>2</sup>(95) = 132.256 (p = 0.004), and explained 51.1% of the variance of foot self-care. Illness threat perceptions (i.e., consequence, timeline, identity, concern, and emotion) had a direct positive effect on foot self-care behaviours, but also indirectly decreased foot self-care through increasing diabetes distress. Control perceptions (i.e., personal control, treatment control, and coherence) were not directly associated with foot self-care behaviours, but indirectly improved foot self-care by reducing diabetes distress and increasing foot care confidence. These findings suggest illness perceptions, diabetes distress, and self-care confidence as modifiable predictors to be targeted in self-management interventions for patients with DFUs.",['Zhu X; Lee ES; Chan FHF; Lim PXH; Chen YC; Griva K'],2024,"management of DFUs relies heavily on patients' foot self-care behaviour. 186 patients with active DFUs self-reported their illness perception, diabetes distress, self-efficacy, and foot self-care behaviour."
Sustainable Implementation of Physician-Pharmacist Collaborative Clinics for Diabetes Management in Primary Healthcare Centers: A Qualitative Study.,"Although physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics for diabetes management have been shown to be effective and cost-effective worldwide, there is limited understanding of the factors that influence their sustainable implementation. This study aims to identify the associated factors and provide sustainability strategy to better implement physician-pharmacist collaborative clinics for diabetes management in primary healthcare centers in China.

Causal relationships between modifiable risk factors and polycystic ovary syndrome: a comprehensive Mendelian randomization study.,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a heritable condition with an as yet unclear etiology. Various factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, environment, inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, iron metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been proposed as potential contributors to PCOS. Nevertheless, a systematic assessment of modifiable risk factors and their causal effects on PCOS is lacking. This study aims to establish a comprehensive profile of modifiable risk factors for PCOS by utilizing a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework. After identifying over 400 modifiable risk factors, we employed a two-sample MR approach, including the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method, Weighted Median method, and MR-Egger, to investigate their causal associations with PCOS. The reliability of our estimates underwent rigorous examination through sensitivity analyses, encompassing Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept analysis, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots. We discovered that factors such as smoking per day, smoking initiation, body mass index, basal metabolic rate, waist-to-hip ratio, whole body fat mass, trunk fat mass, overall health rating, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6n-3) in blood, monounsaturated fatty acids, other polyunsaturated fatty acids apart from 18:2 in blood, omega-3 fatty acids, ratio of bisallylic groups to double bonds, omega-9 and saturated fatty acids, total lipids in medium VLDL, phospholipids in medium VLDL, phospholipids in very large HDL, triglycerides in very large HDL, the genus <i>Oscillibacter</i>, the genus <i>Alistipes</i>, the genus <i>Ruminiclostridium</i> 9, the class <i>Mollicutes</i>, and the phylum <i>Tenericutes</i>, showed a significant effect on heightening genetic susceptibility of PCOS. In contrast, factors including fasting insulin interaction with body mass index, sex hormone-binding globulin, iron, ferritin, SDF1a, college or university degree, years of schooling, household income, the genus <i>Enterorhabdus</i>, the family <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, the order <i>Bifidobacteriales</i>, the class <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and the phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i> were determined to reduce risk of PCOS. This study innovatively employs the MR method to assess causal relationships between 400 modifiable risk factors and the susceptibility of PCOS risk. It supports causal links between factors like smoking, BMI, and various blood lipid levels and PCOS.

Tlr9 deficiency in B cells leads to obesity by promoting inflammation and gut dysbiosis.,"Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes bacterial, viral and self DNA and play an important role in immunity and inflammation. However, the role of TLR9 in obesity is less well-studied. Here, we generate B-cell-specific Tlr9-deficient (Tlr9<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd19Cre<sup>+/-</sup>, KO) B6 mice and model obesity using a high-fat diet. Compared with control mice, B-cell-specific-Tlr9-deficient mice exhibited increased fat tissue inflammation, weight gain, and impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. Furthermore, the frequencies of IL-10-producing-B cells and marginal zone B cells were reduced, and those of follicular and germinal center B cells were increased. This was associated with increased frequencies of IFNγ-producing-T cells and increased follicular helper cells. In addition, gut microbiota from the KO mice induced a pro-inflammatory state leading to immunological and metabolic dysregulation when transferred to germ-free mice. Using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, we identify altered gut microbial communities including reduced Lachnospiraceae, which may play a role in altered metabolism in KO mice.

CVDs are of great concern in the disease progression and prognosis of T2DM. This review is a comprehensive examination of the literature on the relationship between T2DM and cardiovascular risk, nutrition-related cardiometabolic risk (CMR) factors, and impact of dietary modulations on CMR. In recent years the researches has been focus on the importance of a comprehensive treatment approach like dietary modulations to address multiple cardiovascular risk reductions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. Modulation of dietary patterns are the most promising interventions to prevent CMR factors and T2DM via affecting the body weight, glucose control, and microbial diversity of individuals. Current evidence suggests that high-quality dietary patterns such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan and the Mediterranean diet is important in the metabolic control processes of T2DM with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, glucagon-like peptide agonist compounds, and intestinal microbiota changes. Nutrition plays a critical role in preventing and improving CVD outcomes in patients with T2DM. Dietary modulations should be planned considering individual differences in responses to dietary composition and nutritional changes, personal preferences, eating behaviors and gut microbiota differences.",['Dal N; Bilici S'],2024,"diabetes mellitus is a complex health issue. obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and chronic inflammation increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases."
Gross tumor and intracranial control benefits with fractionated radiotherapy compared to stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with WHO grade 2 meningioma.,"Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for WHO grade 2 meningioma. Fractionated radiation therapy (RT) is frequently employed following surgery, though many centers utilize stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for recurrence or progression. Herein, we report disease control outcomes from an institutional cohort with adjuvant fractionated RT versus salvage SRS. We identified 32 patients from an institutional database with WHO grade 2 meningioma and residual/recurrent tumor treated with either SRS or fractionated RT. Patients were treated between 2007 and 2021 and had at least 1 year of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier estimators were used to determine gross tumor control (GTC) and intracranial control (IC). Univariate Cox proportional hazards models using biologically effective dose (BED) as a continuous parameter were used to assess for dose responses. With a median follow-up of 5.5 years, 13 patients (41%) received SRS to a recurrent or progressive nodule, 2 (6%) fractionated radiation to a recurrent or progressive nodule, and 17 (53%) adjuvant fractionated radiation following subtotal resection. 5-year GTC was higher with fractionated RT versus SRS (82% vs. 38%, p=0.03). 5-year IC was also better with fractionated RT versus SRS (82% vs. 11%, p<0.001). On univariate analysis, increasing BED<sub>10</sub> was significantly associated with better GTC (p=0.039); increasing BED<sub>3</sub> was not (p=0.82). In this patient cohort, GTC and IC were significantly higher in patients treated with adjuvant fractionated RT compared to salvage SRS. Increasing BED<sub>10</sub> was associated with better GTC. Fractionated RT may provide a better therapeutic ratio than SRS for grade 2 meningiomas.",['Gravbrot N; Rock CB; Weil CR; Rock CB; Burt LM; DeCesaris CM; Jensen RL; Shrieve DC; Cannon DM'],2024,resection is the mainstay of treatment for grade 2 meningioma. a resection is the mainstay of treatment for grade 2 meningioma. a resection is the mainstay of treatment for a grade 2.

"Trends in primary malignant bone cancer incidence and mortality in the United States, 2000-2017: A population-based study.","Primary malignant bone cancers have extremely low incidence, resulting in poor evaluation of their epidemiological characteristics. The objective of this study was to investigate trends in the incidence of primary malignant bone cancers and related mortality. Data from patients diagnosed with malignant bone cancers from 2000 to 2017 in the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database were retrospectively analyzed. Annual age-adjusted incidence and mortality were calculated, and the annual percentage change analyzed. Further, characteristics including patient age and sex, as well as the primary site and stage of different tumor types, were analyzed. The overall age-adjusted incidence rate of primary malignant bone cancers was 7.70 per million people per year, and incidence rates had increased in patients between 60 and 79 years old, or with tumor size ≥ 8 cm. The incidence of chordoma increased significantly (annual percentage change (APC), 3.0 % per year), while those of WHO grade I and II primary bone cancers decreased. During 2000-2017, the mortality rate attributable to malignant bone cancers across the entire United States was 4.41 per million people per year.

Impact of Operative Approach on Acute Kidney Injury Risk Prediction Models for Colectomy.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious postoperative complication associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Identifying patients at risk for AKI is important for risk stratification and management. This study aimed to develop an AKI risk prediction model for colectomy and determine if the operative approach (laparoscopic versus open) alters the influence of predictive factors through an interaction term analysis. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was analyzed from 2005 to 2019. Patients undergoing laparoscopic and open colectomy were identified and propensity score matched. Multivariable logistic regression identified significant preoperative demographic, comorbidity, and laboratory value predictors of AKI. The predictive ability of a baseline model consisting of these variables was compared to a proposed model incorporating interaction terms between operative approach and predictor variables using the likelihood ratio test, c-statistic, and Brier score. Shapley Additive Explanations values assessed relative importance of significant predictors. 252,372 patients were included in the analysis. Significant AKI predictors were hypertension, age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, preoperative sepsis, Congestive heart failure, preoperative creatinine, preoperative albumin, and operative approach (P < 0.001). The proposed model with interaction terms had improved predictive ability per the likelihood ratio test (P < 0.05) but had no statistically significant interaction terms. C-statistic and Brier scores did not improve. Shapley Additive Explanations analysis showed hypertension had the highest importance. The importance of age and diabetes showed some variation between operative approaches. While the inclusion of interaction terms collectively improved AKI prediction, no individual operative approach interaction terms were significant. Including operative approach interactions may enhance predictive ability of AKI risk models for colectomy.",['Patel NS; Herzog I; Dunn C; Merchant AM'],2024,acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious postoperative complication associated with increased morbidity and mortality. a proposed model with interaction terms had improved predictive ability per the likelihood ratio test (P  0.05) but had no statistically significant interaction terms.
Effects of Type 2 Diabetes on the Neuropsychological Profile in Mild Cognitive Impairment.,"Diabetes is one of the main risk factors for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease.

Senolytic combination of dasatinib and quercetin attenuates renal damage in diabetic kidney disease.,"Senolytic combination of dasatinib and quercetin (DQ) is the most studied senolytics drugs used to treat various age-related diseases. However, its protective activity against diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and underlying mechanisms are uncertain. To investigate the functions and potential mechanisms of the senolytics DQ on DKD. Diabetic db/db mice were administrated DQ or transfected with over-expressed PPARα or shPPARα vector. The positive control group was administered irbesartan. Renal function and fibrotic changes in kidney tissue were tested. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) was conducted to analyze the differential transcriptome between the diabetic and control mice. Molecular docking simulation was used to assess the combination of DQ and potential factors. Moreover, tubular epithelial cells under high-glucose (HG) conditions were incubated with DQ and transfected with or without over-expressed PPARα/siPPARα vector. DQ significantly improved renal function, histopathological and fibrotic changes, alleviated lipid deposition, and increased ATP levels in mice with DKD. DQ reduced multiple fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway-related proteins and up-regulated PPARα in db/db mice. Overexpression of PPARα upregulated the expression of PPARα-targeting downstream FAO pathway-related proteins, restored renal function, and inhibited renal fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, molecular docking and dynamics simulation analyses indicated the nephroprotective effect of DQ via binding to PPARα. Knockdown of PPARα reversed the effect of DQ on the FAO pathway and impaired the protective effect of DQ during DKD. For the first time, DQ was found to exert a renal protective effect by binding to PPARα and attenuating renal damage through the promotion of FAO in DKD.",['Guo X; Wen S; Wang J; Zeng X; Yu H; Chen Y; Zhu X; Xu L'],2024,senolytic combination of dasatinib and quercetin (DQ) is the most studied senolytics drugs used to treat various age-related diseases. but its protective activity against diabetic kidney disease and underlying mechanisms are uncertain.
Associations between OGTT results during pregnancy and offspring TSH levels: a birth cohort study.,"Limited evidence exists regarding the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in newborns. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential risk of elevated TSH levels in infants exposed to maternal GDM, considering the type and number of abnormal values obtained from the 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). A population-based, prospective birth cohort study was conducted in Wuhan, China. The study included women who underwent GDM screening using a 75-g OGTT. Neonatal TSH levels were measured via a time-resolved immunofluorescence assay. We estimated and stratified the overall risk (adjusted Risk Ratio [RR]) of elevated TSH levels (defined as TSH > 10 mIU/L or > 20 mIU/L) in offspring based on the type and number of abnormal OGTT values. Out of 15,236 eligible mother-offspring pairs, 11.5% (1,753) of mothers were diagnosed with GDM. Offspring born to women diagnosed with GDM demonstrated a statistically significant elevation in TSH levels when compared to offspring of non-GDM mothers, with a mean difference of 0.20 [95% CI: 0.04-0.36]. The incidence of elevated TSH levels (TSH > 10 mIU/L) in offspring of non-GDM women was 6.3 per 1,000 live births. Newborns exposed to mothers with three abnormal OGTT values displayed an almost five-fold increased risk of elevated TSH levels (adjusted RR 4.77 [95% CI 1.64-13.96]). Maternal fasting blood glucose was independently and positively correlated with neonatal TSH levels and elevated TSH status (TSH > 20 mIU/L). For newborns of women with GDM, personalized risk assessment for elevated TSH levels can be predicated on the type and number of abnormal OGTT values. Furthermore, fasting blood glucose emerges as a critical predictive marker for elevated neonatal TSH status.",['Yang M; Cao Z; Zhu W; Feng X; Zhou J; Liu J; Zhong Y; Zhou Y; Mei H; Cai X; Hu L; Zhou A; Xiao H'],2024,study aimed to investigate the potential risk of elevated TSH levels in infants exposed to maternal GDM. study included women who underwent a 75-g OGTT.
Network approach reveals preferential T-cell and macrophage association with α-linked β-cells in early stage of insulitis in NOD mice.,"One of the challenges in studying islet inflammation - insulitis - is that it is a transient phenomenon. Traditional reporting of the insulitis progression is based on cumulative, donor-averaged values of leucocyte density in the vicinity of pancreatic islets, that hinders intra- and inter-islet heterogeneity of disease progression. Here, we aimed to understand why insulitis is non-uniform, often with peri-insulitis lesions formed on one side of an islet. To achieve this, we demonstrated applicability of network theory in detangling intra-islet multi-cellular interactions during insulitis. Specifically, we asked the question ""what is unique about regions of the islet which interact with immune cells first"". This study utilized the non-obese diabetic mouse model of type one diabetes and examined the interplay among α-, β-, T-cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages in pancreatic islets during the progression of insulitis. Disease evolution was tracked based on T/β cell ratio in individual islets. In the early stage, we found that immune cells are preferentially interacting with α-cell-rich regions of an islet. At the islet periphery α-linked β-cells were found to be targeted significantly more compared to those without α-cell neighbors. Additionally, network analysis revealed increased T-myeloid, and T-macrophage interactions with all β-cells.",['Balasenthilkumaran NV; Whitesell JC; Pyle L; Friedman R; Kravets V'],2024,"insulitis is non-uniform, often with peri-insulitis lesions formed on one side of an islet. we examined interplay between -, -, T-cells, myeloid cells, and macrophages."
Evaluating GIP and glucagon as key regulators of insulin secretion in the pancreatic islet.,"The incretin axis is an essential component of postprandial insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. There are two incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which exert multiple actions throughout the body. A key cellular target for the incretins are pancreatic b-cells, where they potentiate nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion. This feature of incretins have made this system an attractive target for therapeutic interventions aimed at controlling glycemia. Here, we discuss the role of GIP in both b-cells and a-cells within the islet, to stimulate insulin and glucagon secretion, respectively. Moreover, we discuss how glucagon secretion from a-cells has important insulinotropic actions in b-cells through an axis termed a- to b-cell communication. These recent advances have elevated the potential of GIP and glucagon as a therapeutic targets, coinciding with emerging compounds that pharmacologically leverage the actions of these two peptides in the context of diabetes and obesity.",['Lewandowski SL; El K; Campbell JE'],2024,incretins exert multiple actions throughout the body. they can be used to stimulate insulin and glucagon secretion. this feature of incretins has made this system attractive target.
Use of topical methylene blue to image nuclear morphometry with a low-cost scanning darkfield microendoscope.,"Fiber-optic microendoscopy is a promising approach to noninvasively visualize epithelial nuclear morphometry for early cancer and precancer detection. However, the broader clinical application of this approach is limited by a lack of topical contrast agents available for <i>in vivo</i> use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability to image nuclear morphometry <i>in vivo</i> with a novel fiber-optic microendoscope used together with topical application of methylene blue (MB), a dye with FDA approval for use in chromoendoscopy in the gastrointestinal tract. The low-cost, high-resolution microendoscope implements scanning darkfield imaging without complex optomechanical components by leveraging programmable illumination and the rolling shutter of the image sensor. We validate the integration of our system and MB staining for visualizing epithelial cell nuclei by performing <i>ex vivo</i> imaging on fresh animal specimens and <i>in vivo</i> imaging on healthy volunteers. The results indicate that scanning darkfield imaging significantly reduces specular reflection and resolves epithelial nuclei with enhanced image contrast and spatial resolution compared to non-scanning widefield imaging. The image quality of darkfield images with MB staining is comparable to that of fluorescence images with proflavine staining. Our approach enables real-time microscopic evaluation of nuclear patterns and has the potential to be a powerful noninvasive tool for early cancer detection.",['Hou H; Carns J; Schwarz RA; Gillenwater AM; Anandasabapathy S; Richards-Kortum RR'],2024,fiber-optic microendoscopy is a promising approach to noninvasively visualize epithelial nuclear morphometry. but the broader clinical application of this approach is limited by a lack of topical contrast agents available for i>in vivo/i> use. the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability to image nuclear morphometry i>in vivo/i> with a novel fiber-optic microendoscope.
The Influence Factors of Hypoparathyroidism after Thyroidectomy and the Effect of Recovery Treatment.,"This study aims to investigate the influencing factors of transient hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy and assess the effects of rehabilitation treatment, focusing on enhancing management and outcomes for patients. In this retrospective study, 90 patients who underwent thyroidectomy in our hospital from February 2021 to February 2023 were collected. According to the postoperative level of parathyroid hormone (PTH), the patients were divided into normal group [(no hypoparathyroidism, ≥ 0.27 pmol/l), n=65] and hypoparathyroidism (transient hypoparathyroidism, < 0.27 pmol/l, n=25). We retrospectively analyzed 90 thyroidectomy patients, categorizing them into normal and hypoparathyroidism groups based on postoperative parathyroid hormone levels. Logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were employed to evaluate the factors influencing transient hypoparathyroidism and predict recovery.Clinical data of the two groups of patients were collected, and the relationship between postoperative 1dPTH (Parathyroid hormone levels on the first postoperative day) level and recovery effect was analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of temporary hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy, and a ROC curve was used to predict the efficacy of the 1dPTH level on postoperative PTH recovery time. There were no differences in gender, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia between the two groups (P > .05). The age and tumor diameter of the normal group were lower than those of the hypoactive group, and the proportion of patients with thyroiditis and malignant tumors, as well as patients undergoing total thyroidectomy and removal of tracheoesophageal lymph nodes in the normal group were significantly lower than those in the hypoactive group. The above differences were statistically significant (P < .05). Logistic regression analysis showed that older age, malignant tumor, larger tumor diameter, total thyroidectomy, and tracheoesophageal lymph node dissection were independent risk factors for transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy (P < .05). The level of PTH on the 1st day after surgery in patients with recovery time ≤ 1 month was higher than that in patients with recovery time > 1 month, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). ROC curve showed that the PTH level on the 1st day after surgery had a certain predictive value on PTH recovery time, and the AUC value (area under the curve) was 0.873 (P < .05). These findings suggest that patients with older age, malignancy, larger tumor diameter, total thyroidectomy, and removal of tracheoesophageal lymph nodes are more likely to develop transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroidectomy. This understanding is crucial for the management of postoperative patients, and physicians may need to pay special attention to these high-risk patients and implement appropriate interventions to reduce the occurrence of hypoparathyroidism. Significant factors contributing to transient hypoparathyroidism included older age, malignant tumors, larger tumor diameter, total thyroidectomy, and tracheoesophageal lymph node dissection. These findings, backed by statistical significance, underline the clinical relevance of these risk factors in postoperative management. The study identifies key risk factors for transient hypoparathyroidism post-thyroidectomy, emphasizing the need for tailored postoperative care. The predictive value of immediate postoperative PTH levels could guide clinical management to mitigate hypoparathyroidism risks.",['Bai X; Xu Y; Liu Y'],2024,retrospectively analyzed 90 thyroidectomy patients. logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were employed to evaluate the factors influencing transient hypoparathyroidism and predict recovery.
Alarmin S100A8 imparts chemoresistance of esophageal cancer by reprogramming cancer-associated fibroblasts.,"Chemotherapy remains the first-line treatment for advanced esophageal cancer. However, durable benefits are achieved by only a limited subset of individuals due to the elusive chemoresistance. Here, we utilize patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma to investigate chemoresistance mechanisms in preclinical settings. We observe that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are enriched in the tumor microenvironment of PDXs resistant to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we reveal that cancer-cell-derived S100A8 triggers the intracellular RhoA-ROCK-MLC2-MRTF-A pathway by binding to the CD147 receptor of CAFs, inducing CAF polarization and leading to chemoresistance. Therapeutically, we demonstrate that blocking the S100A8-CD147 pathway can improve chemotherapy efficiency. Prognostically, we found the S100A8 levels in peripheral blood can serve as an indicator of chemotherapy responsiveness. Collectively, our study offers a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in esophageal cancer and highlights the potential value of S100A8 in the clinical management of esophageal cancer.",['Chen X; Cheng G; Zhu L; Liu T; Yang X; Liu R; Ou Z; Zhang S; Tan W; Lin D; Wu C'],2024,esophageal cancer is a rare disease that can be treated with chemoresistance. a limited subset of individuals are able to develop chemoresistance. a study aims to investigate chemoresistance mechanisms in preclinical settings.

The aim of this study was to capture real-world data on the characteristics, disease progression, and treatment patterns among PC patients in the ME. This was a retrospective, observational, multi-centre study conducted across ten hospitals/research centers in Lebanon, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait. Data were abstracted from medical records of 615 male patients who were diagnosed with PC between January 2012 and the site initiation date (December 2018-May 2019) and received at least one PC treatment/intervention. The observation period ranged between 84 and 88 months. Data were collected on demographics, clinical characteristics, time to progression to the subsequent clinical state or therapy (progression from localised/locally advanced PC to castration and to metastatic PC (metastatic castration-sensitive PC (mCSPC) or metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC)), progression from mCSPC to mCRPC, and mCRPC patients' progression to first subsequent line of therapy), treatment patterns, and mortality. Most patients had localised/locally advanced PC (57.7%), followed by mCSPC (37.4%), and mCRPC (4.1%) at the time of inclusion in the study. Most patients were at tumours, nodes and metastases (TNM) stage IIIa (40.1%) or TNM stage IVb (27.8%) at study entry.

Clinician Perceptions on Using Decision Tools to Support Prediction-Based Shared Decision Making for Lung Cancer Screening.,"Considering a patient's full risk factor profile can promote personalized shared decision making (SDM). One way to accomplish this is through encounter tools that incorporate prediction models, but little is known about clinicians' perceptions of the feasibility of using these tools in practice. We examined how clinicians react to using one such encounter tool for personalizing SDM about lung cancer screening (LCS). We conducted a qualitative study based on field notes from academic detailing visits during a multisite quality improvement program. The detailer engaged one-on-one with 96 primary care clinicians across multiple Veterans Affairs sites (7 medical centers and 6 outlying clinics) to get feedback on 1) the rationale for prediction-based LCS and 2) how to use the DecisionPrecision (DP) encounter tool with eligible patients to personalize LCS discussions. Thematic content analysis from detailing visit data identified 6 categories of clinician willingness to use the DP tool to personalize SDM for LCS (adoption potential), varying from ""Enthusiastic Potential Adopter"" (<i>n</i> = 18) to ""Definite Non-Adopter"" (<i>n</i> = 16). Many clinicians (<i>n</i> = 52) articulated how they found the concept of prediction-based SDM highly appealing. However, to varying degrees, nearly all clinicians identified challenges to incorporating such an approach in routine practice. The results are based on the clinician's initial reactions rather than longitudinal experience. While many primary care clinicians saw real value in using prediction to personalize LCS decisions, more support is needed to overcome barriers to using encounter tools in practice. Based on these findings, we propose several strategies that may facilitate the adoption of prediction-based SDM in contexts such as LCS.

Comprehensive outcomes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a near-complete 15-year follow-up.,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has a well-established safety and efficacy profile in the short and mid-term. Long-term outcomes remain limited in the literature, especially for follow-up periods of >10 years. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term durability and safety of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass over a near-complete 15-year follow-up. This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent primary laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 2008 and 2009 with ≥14-year follow-up. Data collected and analyzed were weight loss, obesity-related medical condition resolution and recurrence, weight recurrence, complication rate, and mortality rate. A total of 264 patients were included. Patients were predominantly female (81.8%), and the mean age and preoperative body mass index were 48.5 ± 12.2 years and 44.9 ± 7.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The maximum mean percentage total weight loss achieved at 1 year was 31.5% ± 5.7% and was consistently >20% throughout follow-up. Sustained resolution of obesity-related medical conditions was achieved with a remission rate of 60.8% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 46.7% for denoted dyslipidemia, and 40% for hypertension. Obesity-related medical condition recurrence was observed with a recurrence rate of 24.1% for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 17.9% for hypertension, and 14.8% for denoted dyslipidemia. Significant factors associated with weight loss were maximum percentage total weight loss and preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus. Over 15 years, the weight recurrence rate was 51.1%, with predictors of higher preoperative body mass index and preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provides sustainable weight loss over a 15-year period, with consistent long-term weight-loss outcomes and resolution of obesity-related medical conditions sustained for ≥10 years after surgery.",['Jawhar N; Abi Mosleh K; Bartosiak KZ; Hage K; Kennel KA; Mundi MS; Kendrick ML; Ghanem OM'],2024,laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has a well-established safety profile. long-term outcomes remain limited in the literature.
Healthcare utilisation by diabetic patients in Denmark: the role of primary care in reducing emergency visits.,"Improving the management of diabetic patients is receiving increasing attention in the health policy agenda due to increasing prevalence in the population and raising pressure on healthcare resources. This paper examines the determinants of healthcare services utilisation in patients with type-2 diabetes, investigating the potential substitution effect of general practice visits on the utilisation of emergency department visits. By using rich longitudinal data from Denmark and a bivariate econometric model, our analysis highlights primary care services that are more effective in preventing emergency department visits and socioeconomic groups of patients with a weak substitution response. Our results suggest that empowering primary care services, such as preventive assessment visits, may contribute to reducing emergency department visits significantly. Moreover, special attention should be devoted to vulnerable groups, such as patients from low socioeconomic background and older patients, who may find more difficult achieving a large substitution response.",['Laudicella M; Li Donni P; Prete V'],2024,research examines the potential substitution effect of general practice visits on the utilisation of emergency department visits. primary care services are more effective in preventing emergency department visits and socioeconomic groups of patients with a weak substitution response.
Prediction of Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke Using Clinical Registries for Research.,"A reliable method of predicting large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke in data sets without neuroimaging could be retrospectively applied to expand research efforts. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional cohort analysis of the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-Stroke registry. We included adult patients with a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke from 2016 to 2021 who had brain and vascular imaging and excluded those with missing data or posterior circulation stroke. We included 416,022 patients of which 125,381 (30.1%) had LVO. The mean age was 71 years, and 48.2% were female. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for the final model, including age, sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, TOAST stroke mechanism, and NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), was 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.80). Without TOAST mechanism, the AUC was 0.74. The specificity did not exceed 0.5 using different cut points for the NIHSS. We found that 30% of adult acute ischemic stroke patients in GWTG-Stroke have LVO and that the combination of clinical covariates and NIHSS is only moderately predictive of LVO status. These results are consistent with previous studies and suggest it may not be possible to retrospectively predict LVO with high accuracy in data sets without vascular neuroimaging.",['de Havenon A; Ayodele I; Alhanti B; Mac Grory B; Xian Y; Fonarow G; Smith EE; Worrall BB'],2024,a reliable method of predicting large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke could be applied to expand research efforts. we included adult patients with a final diagnosis of ischemic stroke from 2016 to 2021.
Prevalence of high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes in outpatient Malian women living with HIV: a pilot study.,"Long-term exposure to high-risk human papillomavirus (Hr-HPV) is a well-known necessary condition for development of cervical cancer. The aim of this study is to screen for Hr-HPV using vaginal self-sampling, which is a more effective approach to improve women's adherence and increase screening rates. This pilot study included a total of 100 Women living with HIV (WLWHIV), recruited from the Center for Listening, Care, Animation, and Counseling of People Living with HIV in Bamako. Hr-HPV genotyping was performed on Self-collected samples using the Cepheid GeneXpert instrument. The median age of WLWHIV was 44 (interquartile range [IQR], 37-50) years. Approximately 92% of the study participants preferred self-sampling at the clinic, and 90% opted to receive result notifications via mobile phone contact. The overall prevalence of Hr-HPV among study participants was 42.6%, and the most frequent Hr-HPV sub-types observed were HPV18/45 (19.1%), HPV31/35/33/52/58 (13.8%), and HPV39/68/56/66 (12.8%), followed by HPV16 (5.3%), and HPV51/59 (5.3%). WLWHIV under 35 years of age had a higher frequency of Hr-HPV compared to their older counterparts, with rates of 30% versus 11.1% (p = 0.03). The duration of antiretroviral treatment showed an inverse association with Hr-HPV negativity, with patients on treatment for 15 (IQR, 10-18) years versus 12 (IQR = 7-14) years for Hr-HPV positive patients (95% CI [1.2-5.8], t = 3.04, p = 0.003). WLWHIV with baseline CD4 T-Cell counts below 200 exhibited a higher frequency of Hr-HPV compared to those with baseline CD4 T-Cell counts above 200 (17.9% versus 1.9%, p = 0.009). However, other demographics and clinical factors, such as marital status, age of sexual debut, parity, education, history of abortion, history of preeclampsia, and cesarean delivery, did not influence the distribution of Hr-HPV genotypes. Our findings indicate that WLWHIV under the age of 35 years old exhibited the highest prevalence of Hr-HPV infection, with HPV18/45 being the most prevalent subtype. Additionally, WLWHIV with baseline CD4 T-Cell counts below 200 showed the highest infection rates.",['Traore B; Kassogue Y; Diakite B; Diarra F; Cisse K; Kassogue O; Diarra M; Coulibaly A; Coulibaly B; Diallo H; Diarra Z; Ly M; Maiga A; Sissoko SB; Sissoko AS; Traore CB; Kamate B; Teguete I; Bah S; Dolo G; Gursel DB; Holl J; Hou L; Maiga M'],2024,WLWHIV under 35 years of age had a higher frequency of Hr-HPV compared to their older counterparts. the study was conducted using vaginal self-sampling. the study was carried out by 100 women living with HIV.

MRI radiomics captures early treatment response in patient-derived organoid endometrial cancer mouse models.,"Radiomics can capture microscale information in medical images beyond what is visible to the naked human eye. Using a clinically relevant mouse model for endometrial cancer, the objective of this study was to develop and validate a radiomic signature (<i>RS</i>) predicting response to standard chemotherapy. Mice orthotopically implanted with a patient-derived grade 3 endometrioid endometrial cancer organoid model (O-PDX) were allocated to chemotherapy (combined paclitaxel/carboplatin, n=11) or saline/control (n=13). During tumor progression, the mice underwent weekly T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Segmentation of primary tumor volume (vMRI) allowed extraction of radiomic features from whole-volume tumor masks. A radiomic model for predicting treatment response was derived employing least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) statistics at endpoint images in the orthotopic O-PDX (<i>RS_O</i>), and subsequently applied on the earlier study timepoints (<i>RS_O</i> at baseline, and week 1-3). For external validation, the radiomic model was tested in a separate T2w-MRI dataset on segmented whole-volume subcutaneous tumors (<i>RS_S</i>) from the same O-PDX model, imaged at three timepoints (baseline, day 3 and day 10/endpoint) after start of chemotherapy (n=8 tumors) or saline/control (n=8 tumors). The <i>RS_O</i> yielded rapidly increasing area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs) for predicting treatment response from baseline until endpoint; AUC=0.38 (baseline); 0.80 (week 1), 0.85 (week 2), 0.96 (week 3) and 1.0 (endpoint). In comparison, vMRI yielded AUCs of 0.37 (baseline); 0.69 (w1); 0.83 (week 2); 0.92 (week 3) and 0.97 (endpoint). When tested in the external validation dataset, <i>RS_S</i> yielded high accuracy for predicting treatment response at day10/endpoint (AUC=0.85) and tended to yield higher AUC than vMRI (AUC=0.78, p=0.18). Neither <i>RS_S</i> nor vMRI predicted response at day 3 in the external validation set (AUC=0.56 for both). We have developed and validated a radiomic signature that was able to capture chemotherapeutic treatment response both in an O-PDX and in a subcutaneous endometrial cancer mouse model. This study supports the promising role of preclinical imaging including radiomic tumor profiling to assess early treatment response in endometrial cancer models.",['Espedal H; Fasmer KE; Berg HF; Lyngstad JM; Schilling T; Krakstad C; Haldorsen IS'],2024,a mouse model for endometrial cancer was used to test a radiomic signature. the model was compared to the same model. the model was tested in a separate T2w-MRI dataset.
Pathomic model based on histopathological features and machine learning to predict IDO1 status and its association with breast cancer prognosis.,"To establish a pathomic model using histopathological image features for predicting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) status and its relationship with overall survival (OS) in breast cancer. A pathomic model was constructed using machine learning and histopathological images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to predict IDO1 expression. The model performance was evaluated based on the area under the curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Prediction scores (PSes) were generated from the model and applied to divide the patients into two groups. Survival outcomes, gene set enrichment, immune microenvironment, and tumor mutations were assessed between the two groups. Survival analysis followed by multivariate correction revealed that high IDO1 is a protective factor for OS. Further, the model was calibrated, and it exhibited good discrimination. Additionally, the DCA showed that the proposed model provided a good clinical net benefit. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a positive correlation between high PS and improved OS. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that PS is an independent protective factor for OS. Moreover, differentially expressed genes were enriched in various essential biological processes, including extracellular matrix receptor interaction, angiogenesis, transforming growth factor β signaling, epithelial mesenchymal transition, cell junction, tryptophan metabolism, and heme metabolic processes. PS was positively correlated with M1 macrophages, CD8 + T cells, T follicular helper cells, and tumor mutational burden. These results indicate the potential ability of the proposed pathomic model to predict IDO1 status and the OS of breast cancer patients.",['Zhuo X; Deng H; Qiu M; Qiu X'],2024,"pathomic model was constructed using machine learning and histopathological images. model performance was evaluated based on the area under the curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. survival outcomes, gene set enrichment, immune microenvironment, and tumor mutations were assessed between the two groups."
Single-Center Experience of Using Liraglutide in Adolescents With Obesity +/- Type 2 Diabetes.,"Background Childhood obesity is recognized as a chronic illness with limited therapeutic options. Tackling obesity (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters, at the 95th percentile or higher) with lifestyle interventions, especially in adolescents, has proven to be a daunting task, yielding only modest results. Research on the use of liraglutide for weight reduction in pediatric patients has yielded conflicting results. Notably, there is a lack of studies in the Middle East reporting on the outcomes of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in treating obesity in children and adolescents, with or without diabetes. This study, conducted in the Middle East, represents the first investigation into the utilization of liraglutide for weight reduction in this pediatric population. Methods This retrospective study collected data on 22 consecutive participants, aged 12 to 19 years, who were diagnosed with obesity (defined as having a BMI greater than the 95th percentile for their age and sex) and had either type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or were non-diabetic who attended endocrine clinics in Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar, between 2020 and 2022. The study protocol involved a liraglutide treatment period spanning 18 months (72 weeks), with scheduled follow-up appointments at six-month intervals. The primary endpoints were changes in weight and BMI from baseline to the 72-week mark. Secondary endpoints were safety measures and changes in HbA1c.  Results Out of the initial cohort of 22 patients, 12 completed the full 72-week duration of the study, while 10 patients either discontinued treatment or did not adhere to the prescribed medication regimen due to side effects. Among the 12 patients who completed the study, six had a diagnosis of T2DM. At baseline, the weight, standard deviation score (SDS), BMI, and BMI standard deviation (SD) were 113.9 kg, 2.9, 40.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 2.6 respectively. At the 18-month follow-up, the weight, SDS, BMI, and BMI SD were 117.8kg, 2.6, 39kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 2.5, respectively. Thus, no statistically significant change in the weight parameters was evident at 18 months compared to baseline. Dropout from the study and poor compliance were high (10 out of 22 patients) due to side effects, mainly gastrointestinal (nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting). No statistically significant differences were observed between obese vs. obese with T2DM. No significant change in HbA1c was found between baseline and treatment follow-up in the diabetes patients. No adverse effects in terms of impairment of liver and kidney function or pancreatitis were observed. Conclusions The administration of liraglutide to adolescents with obesity, regardless of whether they had T2DM or not, in a real-life setting, did not yield statistically significant reductions in BMI/weight parameters, and HbA1c levels at the 72-week mark. Nevertheless, the study findings indicate that liraglutide is deemed safe for utilization within this age group, despite the presence of mild gastrointestinal side effects.",['Dauleh H; Pasha M; Gad H; Haris B; Petrovski G; Afyouni H; Khalifa A; Shehzad S; Amin R; Chirayath S; Mohamadsalih G; Mohammed S; Malik RA; Hussain K'],2024,study reveals the use of liraglutide for weight reduction in pediatric patients. the study was conducted in the middle east. it was the first investigation into the use of liraglutide for weight reduction.
"Communication rules regarding support seeking in patients with a physical illness, according to people with a Surinamese or a Dutch cultural background.","People with different cultural backgrounds can evaluate the appropriateness of direct and indirect support seeking differently. In this study we explored how direct and indirect communication rules for verbal support seeking by patients with diabetes were perceived among Dutch and Surinamese female participants, and whether the appropriateness differed for the ingroup, outgroup and intercultural support seeker-support provider interactions. The study applied a 2 (direct versus indirect support seeking) X 2 (Surinamese patient versus Dutch patient) X 2 (Surinamese support provider versus Dutch support provider)-design. Dutch and Surinamese participants (<i>N</i> = 686) were randomly assigned to one of the eight conditions in which they were provided with a depiction of the patient, the direct or indirect request for help, and the help provider. The main outcome was the rated appropriateness of the help-seeking request in the specific context. The results revealed a significant main effect of communication style: both, Surinamese and Dutch participants evaluated the direct help-seeking as more appropriate compared to indirect help-seeking, independent of patient or provider culture. This effect was particularly strong in participants who scored high on the individual difference in independent self, as shown by a significant interaction. Literature usually identifies that Surinamese and Dutch populations have different cultural backgrounds and values that express themselves in different attitudes, in general more collectivistic and more individualistic, respectively. However, with regard to help seeking preferences the study results did not verify this expectation. These findings underscore the importance of the support providers' role in assessing and understanding the individuals' communication style with regard to help-seeking, rather than assuming communication preferences on the basis of cultural background.",['Rokadji G; Dijkstra A'],2024,"study compared direct and indirect communication rules for verbal support seeking. study examined whether appropriateness differed for ingroup, outgroup and intercultural support seeker-support provider interactions. study compared direct and indirect support seeking to indirect support seeking."
Risk Factors for Postoperative Complications of Laparoscopic Right Colectomy: A Post Hoc Analysis of RELARC Trial.,"There is concern regarding the possibility of postoperative complications for laparoscopic right colectomy. To evaluate the risk factors of postoperative complications for patients undergoing laparoscopic right colectomy. This was an observational study. This was a post-hoc analysis of a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RELARC trial, NCT02619942). Patients included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis in RELARC trial were all enrolled in this study. Risk factors for postoperative complications were identified using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Of 995 patients, 206 (20.7%) had postoperative complications. Comorbidity (p = 0.02, OR: 1.544, 95% CI: 1.077-2.212) and operative time >180 min (p = 0.03, OR: 1.453, 95% CI: 1.032-2.044) were independent risk factors for postoperative complications. While female (p = 0.04, OR: 0.704, 95% CI: 0.506-0.980) and extracorporeal anastomosis (p < 0.001, OR: 0.251, 95% CI: 0.166-0.378) were protective factors. Eighty (8.0%) had overall surgical site infection, 53 (5.3%) had incisional SSI, and 33 (3.3%) had organ/space SSI. Side-to-side anastomosis was a risk factor for overall surgical site infection (p < 0.001, OR: 1.912, 95% CI: 1.118-3.268) and organ/space surgical site infection (p = 0.005, OR: 3.579, 95% CI: 1.455-8.805). Extracorporeal anastomosis was associated with a reduced risk of overall surgical site infection (p < 0.001, OR: 0.239, 95% CI: 0.138-0.413), organ/space surgical site infection (p = 0.002 OR: 0.296, 95% CI: 0.136-0.646), and incisional surgical site infection (p < 0.001, OR: 0.179, 95% CI: 0.099-0.322). Diabetes (p = 0.039 OR: 2.090, 95% CI: 1.039-4.205) and conversion to open surgery (p = 0.013 OR: 5.403, 95% CI: 1.437-20.319) were risk factors for incisional surgical site infection. Due to the retrospective nature, the key limitation is the lack of prospective documentation and standardization about perioperative management of these patients such as preoperative optimization, bowel prep regimes and antibiotic regimes, which may be confounder factors of complications. All surgeries were done by experienced surgeons and the patients enrolled were relatively young, generally healthy, and non-obese. It is unclear whether the results will be generalizable to obese and other populations worldwide. Male, comorbidity, prolonged operative time, and intracorporeal anastomosis were independent risk factors of postoperative complications of laparoscopic right colectomy. Side-to-side anastomosis was associated with an increased risk of organ/space surgical site infection. Extracorporeal anastomosis could reduce the incidence of overall surgical site infection. Diabetes and conversion to open surgery were associated with an increased risk of incisional surgical site infection.

Transition to self-management among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes: a mixed methods study.,"Emerging adulthood is challenging for young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This study evaluated transition to diabetes self-management and perceptions of care transfer using mixed methods. An online survey queried demographics, management characteristics, diabetes knowledge, self-care readiness, adherence, and diabetes distress. T-tests compared survey scores between those with self-reported target A1c <7.0% versus ≥7.0%. Pearson correlations assessed associations between A1c and diabetes distress, stratified by A1c <7.0% versus ≥7.0%. Qualitative semi-structured interviews elicited perceptions of young adults; transcripts were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis. Of 141 participants (30% male, 84% non-Hispanic white) completing the survey, 41% self-reported target A1c <7.0%. Diabetes knowledge and self-care readiness scores did not differ between those with A1c <7.0% versus ≥7.0%, while diabetes distress was lower (45 ± 20 vs 52 ± 20, p=0.01) and adherence higher (77 ± 12 vs 71 ± 14, p=0.02) in those with A1c <7.0% versus ≥7.0%. Diabetes distress was significantly associated with glycemic outcomes in those reporting A1c ≥7.0% (R=0.36, p<0.01). Qualitative analysis (24 participants) revealed five themes and two sub-themes, notable for need for more mental health support, support from others with T1D, benefits of technology for care autonomy, and challenges of obtaining diabetes supplies. Emerging adults with self-reported target A1c endorsed lower diabetes distress and higher adherence than those with elevated A1c. Mental health access, support from others with T1D, technology use, and guidance for supply acquisition may improve transition to self-management and care transfer for emerging adults with T1D.",['Vitale RJ; Asher N; Shank K; Katyal B; Tinsley LJ; Garvey KC; Laffel LMB'],2024,"online survey queried demographics, management characteristics, diabetes knowledge, self-care readiness, adherence, and diabetes distress. 141 participants completed the survey, 41% self-reported target A1c 7.0%."
Machine learning model for prediction of permanent stoma after anterior resection of rectal cancer: A multicenter study.,"The conversion from a temporary to a permanent stoma (PS) following rectal cancer surgery significantly impacts the quality of life of patients. However, there is currently a lack of practical preoperative tools to predict PS formation. The purpose of this study is to establish a preoperative predictive model for PS using machine learning algorithms to guide clinical practice. In this retrospective study, we analyzed clinical data from a total of 655 patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer, with 552 patients from one medical center and 103 from another. Through machine learning algorithms, five predictive models were developed, and each was thoroughly evaluated for predictive performance. The model with superior predictive accuracy underwent additional validation using both an independent testing cohort and the external validation cohort. The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was employed to elucidate the predictive factors influencing the model, providing an in-depth visual analysis of its decision-making process. Eight variables were selected for the construction of the model. The support vector machine (SVM) model exhibited superior predictive performance in the training set, evidenced by an AUC of 0.854 (95 % CI:0.803-0.904). This performance was corroborated in both the testing set and external validation set, where the model demonstrated an AUC of 0.851 (95%CI:0.748-0.954) and 0.815 (95%CI:0.710-0.919), respectively, indicating its efficacy in identifying the PS.

"CLINICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF AQUEOUS AND VITREOUS RETINOL-BINDING PROTEIN 3 CONCENTRATIONS IN RELATION TO DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SEVERITY, RETINAL STRUCTURES, AND SYSTEMIC COMPLICATIONS.","To evaluate Retinol-Binding Protein 3 (RBP3) from photoreceptors in aqueous and its association with vitreous concentrations, diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity, retinal layer thickness, and clinical characteristics in people with diabetes. RBP3 concentration was measured by custom-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in aqueous and correlated with vitreous concentrations in patients from the 50-Year Medalist study and Beetham Eye Institute at Joslin Diabetes Center. Aqueous RBP3 concentration (N = 131) was elevated in eyes with no to mild DR (mean ± SD 0.7 nM ± 0.2) and decreased in eyes with moderate to severe DR (0.65 nM ± 0.3) and proliferative DR (0.5 nM ± 0.2, P < 0.001) compared to eyes without diabetes. Aqueous and vitreous RBP3 concentrations correlated with each other (r = 0.34, P = 0.001) and between fellow eyes (P < 0.0001). History of retinal surgery did not affect aqueous RBP3 concentrations, but cataract surgery affected both vitreous and aqueous levels.

High common-γ cytokine receptor levels promote expression of Interleukin-2/Interleukin-7 receptor α-chains with implications on T-cell differentiation and function.,"Cytokines of the common-γ receptor chain (γ<sub>c</sub>) family are crucial for T-cell differentiation and dysregulation of γ<sub>c</sub> cytokine pathways is involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. There is increasing evidence that the availability of the γ<sub>c</sub> receptor (CD132) for the associated receptor chains has implications for T-cell functions. Here we studied the influence of differential γ<sub>c</sub> expression on the expression of the IL-2Rα (CD25), the IL-7Rα (CD127) and the differentiation of activated naïve T cells. We fine-tuned the regulation of γ<sub>c</sub> expression in human primary naïve T cells by lentiviral transduction using small hairpin (sh)RNAs and γ<sub>c</sub> cDNA. Differential γ<sub>c</sub> levels were then analysed for effects on T-cell phenotype and function after activation. Differential γ<sub>c</sub> expression markedly affected IL-2Rα and IL-7Rα expression on activated naïve T cells. High γ<sub>c</sub> expression (γ<sub>c-high</sub>) induced significantly higher expression of IL-2Rα and re-expression of IL-7Rα after activation. Inhibition of γ<sub>c</sub> caused lower IL-2Rα/IL-7Rα expression and impaired proliferation of activated naïve T cells. In contrast, γ<sub>c-high</sub> T cells secreted significantly higher concentrations of effector cytokines (i.e., IFN-γ, IL-6) and showed higher cytokine-receptor induced STAT5 phosphorylation during initial stages as well as persistently higher pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 levels after activation. Finally, accelerated transition towards a CD45RO expressing effector/memory phenotype was seen especially for CD4<sup>+</sup> γ<sub>c-high</sub> naïve T cells. These results suggested that high expression of γ<sub>c</sub> promotes expression of IL-2Rα and IL-7Rα on activated naïve T cells with significant effects on differentiation and effector cytokine expression.",['Kim JY; Mayatepek E; Seyfarth J; Jacobsen M'],2024,sub>c/sub> receptor (CD132) is crucial for autoimmune diseases. there is increasing evidence that the availability of the sub>c/sub> receptor has implications for T-cell functions.

Exploratory insights into prefrontal cortex activity in continuous glucose monitoring: findings from a portable wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy system.,"The escalating global prevalence of diabetes highlights an urgent need for advancements in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technologies that are non-invasive, accurate, and user-friendly. Here, we introduce a groundbreaking portable wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system designed to monitor glucose levels by assessing prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. Our study delineates the development and application of this novel fNIRS system, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize diabetes management by providing a non-invasive, real-time monitoring solution. Fifteen healthy university students participated in a controlled study, where we monitored their PFC activity and blood glucose levels under fasting and glucose-loaded conditions. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between PFC activity, as measured by our fNIRS system, and blood glucose levels, suggesting the feasibility of fNIRS technology for CGM. The portable nature of our system overcomes the mobility limitations of traditional setups, enabling continuous, real-time monitoring in everyday settings. We identified 10 critical features related to blood glucose levels from extensive fNIRS data and successfully correlated PFC function with blood glucose levels by constructing predictive models. Results show a positive association between fNIRS data and blood glucose levels, with the PFC exhibiting a clear response to blood glucose. Furthermore, the improved regressive rule principal component analysis (PCA) method outperforms traditional PCA in model prediction. We propose a model validation approach based on leave-one-out cross-validation, demonstrating the unique advantages of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models. Comparative analysis with existing CGM methods reveals that our paper's KNN model exhibits lower RMSE and MARD at 0.11 and 8.96%, respectively, and the fNIRS data were highly significant positive correlation with actual blood glucose levels (<i>r</i> = 0.995, <i>p</i> < 0.000). This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between metabolic states and brain activity, laying the foundation for innovative CGM solutions.

Identifying non-genetic factors associated with trigger finger.,"The non-genetic factors predisposing to trigger finger (TF) have mostly been characterised in small studies from individual institutions. Here, we aimed to provide a more complete picture of TF and its associations. This case-control study used cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank population-based cohort to identify and determine the strength of associations of phenotypic variables with TF. We performed multivariable logistic regression of a multitude of phenotypic factors associated with TF. We identified 2250 individuals with medical and surgical diagnostic codes for TF, and 398,495 controls. TF was found to be significantly associated with age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.04, P < 2.23×10<sup>-308</sup>), female sex (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08-1.39, P = 2.35×10<sup>-3</sup>), body mass index (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.16, P = 5.52×10<sup>-4</sup>), carpal tunnel syndrome (OR 9.59, 95% CI 8.68-10.59, P < 2.23×10<sup>-308</sup>), Dupuytren's disease (OR 4.89, 95% CI 4.06-5.89, P < 2.23×10<sup>-308</sup>), diabetes mellitus without complications (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.15-1.58, P = 2.03×10<sup>-4</sup>) and with complications (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.90-3.17, P = 4.98×10<sup>-12</sup>), HbA1c (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02, P = 8.99×10<sup>-9</sup>), hypothyroidism (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.43, P = 4.75×10<sup>-3</sup>) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.68, P = 0.014). Our results provide evidence supporting the well-known risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, carpal tunnel syndrome, age and female sex. Furthermore, we can confirm putative associations such as hypothyroidism, obesity and rheumatoid arthritis, while providing evidence against others such as hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. A novel finding arising from this study is the strong association with Dupuytren's disease.

The application of Global Trigger Tool in monitoring antineoplastic adverse drug events: a retrospective study.,"This study aimed to establish an antineoplastic drugs trigger tool based on Global Trigger Tool (GTT), to examine the performance by detecting adverse drug events (ADEs) in patients with cancer in a Chinese hospital (a retrospective review), and to investigate the factors associating with the occurrence of antineoplastic ADEs. Based on the triggers recommended by the GTT and those used in domestic and foreign studies and taking into account the scope of biochemical indexes in our hospital, some of them were adjusted. A total of 37 triggers were finally developed. Five hundred medical records of oncology patients discharged in our hospital from 1 June 2020 to 31 May 2021 were randomly selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These records were reviewed retrospectively by antineoplastic drugs trigger tool. The sensitivity and specificity of the triggers were analyzed, as well as the characteristics and risk factors for the occurrence of ADEs. Thirty-three of the 37 triggers had positive trigger, and the sensitivity rate was 91.8% (459/500). For the specificity, the positive predictive value of overall ADEs was 46.0% (715/1556), the detection rate of ADEs was 63.0% (315/500), the rate of ADEs per 100 admissions was 136.0 (95% CI, 124.1-147.9), and the rate of ADEs per 1,000 patient days was 208.33 (95% CI, 201.2-215.5). The top three antineoplastic drugs related to ADEs were antimetabolic drugs (29.1%), plant sources and derivatives (27.1%), and metal platinum drugs (26.3%). The hematologic system was most frequently involved (507 cases, 74.6%), followed by gastrointestinal system (89 cases, 13.1%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the number of combined drugs (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07-1.22; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and the previous history of adverse drug reaction (ADR) (OR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.60; <i>P</i> < 0.001) were the risk factors for ADEs. The length of hospital stay (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-1.12; <i>P</i> < 0.05) and the previous history of ADR (OR = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.07-4.45; <i>P</i> < 0.05) were the risk factors for serious adverse drug events (SAE). The established trigger tool could be used to monitor antineoplastic drugs adverse events in patients with tumor effectively but still needs to be optimized. This study may provide some references for further research in order to improve the rationality and safety of antineoplastic medications.",['Liu Y; Liu X; Xia B; Chen J; Sun W; Liu F; Cheng H'],2024,antineoplastic drugs trigger tool was developed to examine the performance of ADEs in patients with cancer. the triggers were used in domestic and foreign studies. a total of 37 triggers were finally developed.
Using a new artificial intelligence-aided method to assess body composition CT segmentation in colorectal cancer patients.,"This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of our own artificial intelligence (AI)-generated model to assess automated segmentation and quantification of body composition-derived computed tomography (CT) slices from the lumber (L3) region in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. A total of 541 axial CT slices at the L3 vertebra were retrospectively collected from 319 patients with CRC diagnosed during 2012-2019 at a single Australian tertiary institution, Western Health in Melbourne. A two-dimensional U-Net convolutional network was trained on 338 slices to segment muscle, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Manual reading of these same slices of muscle, VAT and SAT was created to serve as ground truth data. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to assess the U-Net-based segmentation performance on both a validation dataset (68 slices) and a test dataset (203 slices). The measurement of cross-sectional area and Hounsfield unit (HU) density of muscle, VAT and SAT were compared between two methods. The segmentation for muscle, VAT and SAT demonstrated excellent performance for both the validation (Dice similarity coefficients >0.98, respectively) and test (Dice similarity coefficients >0.97, respectively) datasets. There was a strong positive correlation between manual and AI segmentation measurements of body composition for both datasets (Spearman's correlation coefficients: 0.944-0.999, P < 0.001). Compared to the gold standard, this fully automated segmentation system exhibited a high accuracy for assessing segmentation and quantification of abdominal muscle and adipose tissues of CT slices at the L3 in CRC patients.",['Cao K; Yeung J; Arafat Y; Qiao J; Gartrell R; Master M; Yeung JMC; Baird PN'],2024,"axial CT slices were retrospectively collected from 319 patients with colorectal cancer. a two-dimensional U-Net convolutional network was trained on 338 slices to segment muscle, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)"
Research progress on the role of extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and has become the main cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. In recent years, with the increasing incidence of DM, the pathogenesis of DKD has received increasing attention. The pathogenesis of DKD is diverse and complex. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain cell-derived membrane proteins, nucleic acids (such as DNA and RNA) and other important cellular components and are involved in intercellular information and substance transmission. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have confirmed that EVs play an important role in the development of DKD. The purpose of this paper is to explain the potential diagnostic value of EVs in DKD, analyze the mechanism by which EVs participate in intercellular communication, and explore whether EVs may become drug carriers for targeted therapy to provide a reference for promoting the implementation and application of exosome therapy strategies in clinical practice.",['Jin J; Zhang M'],2024,diabetes mellitus is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus. it is the main cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide.
A novel conductive microtubule hydrogel for electrical stimulation of chronic wounds based on biological electrical wires.,"Electrical stimulation (ES) is considered a promising therapy for chronic wounds via conductive dressing. However, the lack of a clinically suitable conductive dressing is a serious challenge. In this study, a suitable conductive biomaterial with favorable biocompatibility and conductivity was screened by means of an inherent structure derived from the body based on electrical conduction in vivo. Ions condensed around the surface of the microtubules (MTs) derived from the cell's cytoskeleton are allowed to flow in the presence of potential differences, effectively forming a network of biological electrical wires, which is essential to the bioelectrical communication of cells. We hypothesized that MT dressing could improve chronic wound healing via the conductivity of MTs applied by ES. We first developed an MT-MAA hydrogel by a double cross-linking method using UV and calcium chloride to improve chronic wound healing by ES. In vitro studies showed good conductivity, mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of the MT-MAA hydrogel, as well as an elevated secretion of growth factors with enhanced cell proliferation and migration ability in response to ES. The in vivo experimental results from a full-thickness diabetic wound model revealed rapid wound closure within 7d in C57BL/6J mice, and the wound bed dressed by the MT-MAA hydrogel was shown to have promoted re-epithelization, enhanced angiogenesis, accelerated nerve growth, limited inflammation phases, and improved antibacterial effect under the ES treatment. These preclinical findings suggest that the MT-MAA hydrogel may be an ideal conductive dressing for chronic wound healing. Furthermore, biomaterials based on MTs may be also promising for treating other diseases.",['Fan W; Yang X; Hu X; Huang R; Shi H; Liu G'],2024,electrical stimulation is considered a promising therapy for chronic wounds. but the lack of a clinically suitable conductive dressing is a serious challenge. a suitable conductive biomaterial with favorable biocompatibility and conductivity was screened.
"High-flow nasal oxygen in resource-constrained, non-intensive, high-care wards for COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure: Comparing outcomes of the first v. third waves at a tertiary centre in South Africa.","High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is an accepted treatment for severe COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF). To determine whether treatment outcomes at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa, during the third COVID-19 wave would be affected by increased institutional experience and capacity for HNFO and more restrictive admission criteria for respiratory high-care wards and intensive care units. We included consecutive patients with COVID-19-related AHRF treated with HFNO during the first and third COVID-19 waves. The primary endpoint was comparison of HFNO failure (composite of the need for intubation or death while on HFNO) between waves. A total of 744 patients were included: 343 in the first COVID-19 wave and 401 in the third. Patients treated with HFNO in the first wave were older (median (interquartile range) age 53 (46 - 61) years v. 47 (40 - 56) years; p<0.001), and had higher prevalences of diabetes (46.9% v. 36.9%; p=0.006), hypertension (51.0% v. 35.2%; p<0.001), obesity (33.5% v. 26.2%; p=0.029) and HIV infection (12.5% v. 5.5%; p<0.001). The partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub> /FiO<sub>2</sub> ) ratio at HFNO initiation and the ratio of oxygen saturation/FiO<sub>2</sub> to respiratory rate within 6 hours (ROX-6 score) after HFNO commencement were lower in the first wave compared with the third (median 57.9 (47.3 - 74.3) mmHg v. 64.3 (51.2 - 79.0) mmHg; p=0.005 and 3.19 (2.37 - 3.77) v. 3.43 (2.93 - 4.00); p<0.001, respectively). The likelihood of HFNO failure (57.1% v. 59.6%; p=0.498) and mortality (46.9% v. 52.1%; p=0.159) did not differ significantly between the first and third waves. Despite differences in patient characteristics, circulating viral variant and institutional experience with HFNO, treatment outcomes were very similar in the first and third COVID-19 waves. We conclude that once AHRF is established in COVID-19 pneumonia, the comorbidity profile and HFNO provider experience do not appear to affect outcome. <b>What the study adds.</b> This study adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the utility of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) in avoiding invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in patients with severe COVID-19 hypoxaemic respiratory failure, and shows that this utility remained consistent across different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.<b>Implications of the study.</b> In resource-constrained settings, HFNO is a feasible non-invasive alternative to IMV and can be employed with favourable and consistent outcomes outside traditional critical care wards. It also confirms that the degree of gas exchange abnormality, and not pre-existing patient-related factors, circulating wave variant or provider experience, is the main predictor of HFNO failure.",['Audley G; Raubenheimer P; Symons G; Mendelson M; Meintjes G; Ntusi NAB; Wasserman S; Dlamini S; Dheda K; van Zyl-Smit R; Calligaro G'],2024,high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is accepted treatment for severe COVID-19-related acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF).

Association of physical activity and screen time with cardiovascular disease risk in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study.,"According to the Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report, limited evidence is available on sedentary behaviors (screen time) and their joint associations with physical activity (steps) for cardiovascular health in adolescence. The objective of this study was to identify joint associations of screen time and physical activity categories with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, cholesterol) in adolescence. This study analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, comprising a diverse sample of 4,718 U.S. adolescents aged 10-15 years between 2018 and 2021. Steps were measured by a Fitbit wearable device and levels were categorized as low (1,000-6,000), medium (> 6,000-12,000), and high (> 12,000) averaged daily step counts. Self-reported recreational screen time hours per day were classified as low (0-4), medium (> 4-8), and high (> 8) hours per day. CVD risk factors including blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and cholesterol (total and HDL) were measured. The analytical sample averaged 6.6 h of screen time per day and 9,722 steps per day. In models including both screen time and steps, the high screen time category was associated with a 4.27 higher diastolic blood pressure percentile (95% CI 1.83-6.73) and lower HDL cholesterol (B= -2.85, 95% CI -4.77 to -0.94 mg/dL) compared to the low screen time category. Medium (B = 3.68, 95% CI 1.24-6.11) and low (B = 7.64, 95% CI 4.07-11.20) step categories were associated with higher diastolic blood pressure percentile compared to the high step category. The medium step category was associated with lower HDL cholesterol (B= -1.99, 95% CI -3.80 to -0.19 mg/dL) compared to the high step category. Findings were similar when screen time and step counts were analyzed as continuous variables; higher continuous step count was additionally associated with lower total cholesterol (mg/dL). Combinations of low screen time and high steps were generally associated with favorable cardiovascular health markers including lower diastolic blood pressure and higher HDL cholesterol, which can inform future adolescent health guidelines.",['Nagata JM; Weinstein S; Alsamman S; Lee CM; Dooley EE; Ganson KT; Testa A; Gooding HC; Kiss O; Baker FC; Pettee Gabriel K'],2024,"adolescent brain cognitive development study analyzed data from a diverse sample of 4,718 adolescents aged 10-15 years between 2018 and 2021. step counts were categorized as low (1,000-6,000), medium (> 6,000-12,000), and high (> 12,000) averaged daily step counts."
Current status and breakthroughs in treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.,"Recently, targeted therapy and immunotherapy have emerged as effective treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This progress has been facilitated by the rapid development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies and the continuous research and development of new drugs, leading to a new era in precision medicine for NSCLC. This is a breakthrough for patients with common mutations in the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in NSCLC. Consequently, the use of targeted drugs has significantly improved survival. Nevertheless, certain rare genetic mutations are referred to as EGFR exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutations, which differ in structure from conventional EGFR gene mutations, namely, exon 19 deletion mutations (19-Del) and exon 21 point mutations. Owing to their distinct structural characteristics, patients harboring these EGFR ex20ins mutations are unresponsive to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. This particular group of patients did not fall within the scope of their applicability. However, the activating A763_Y764insFQEA mutation elicits a more pronounced response than mutations in the near and far regions of the C-helix immediately following it and should, therefore, be treated differently. Currently, there is a lack of effective treatments for EGFR ex20ins mutations NSCLC. The efficacy of chemotherapy has been relatively favorable, whereas the effectiveness of immunotherapy remains ambiguous owing to inadequate clinical data. In addition, the efficacy of the first- and second-generation targeted drugs remains limited. However, third-generation and novel targeted drugs have proven to be effective. Although novel EGFR-TKIs are expected to treat EGFR ex20ins mutations in patients with NSCLC, they face many challenges. The main focus of this review is on emerging therapies that target NSCLC with EGFR ex20ins and highlight major ongoing clinical trials while also providing an overview of the associated challenges and research advancements in this area.",['Hu M; Zhong C; Wang J; Chen J; Zhou T'],2024,"targeted therapy and immunotherapy have emerged as effective treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) this breakthrough has been facilitated by the rapid development of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies and the continuous research and development of new drugs. despite their distinct structural characteristics, patients harboring these EGFR ex20ins mutations are unresponsive to traditional tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy."
Microbiota-gut-brain axis: the mediator of exercise and brain health.,"The brain controls the nerve system, allowing complex emotional and cognitive activities. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional neural, hormonal, and immune signaling pathway that could link the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. Over the past few decades, gut microbiota has been demonstrated to be an essential component of the gastrointestinal tract that plays a crucial role in regulating most functions of various body organs. The effects of the microbiota on the brain occur through the production of neurotransmitters, hormones, and metabolites, regulation of host-produced metabolites, or through the synthesis of metabolites by the microbiota themselves. This affects the host's behavior, mood, attention state, and the brain's food reward system. Meanwhile, there is an intimate association between the gut microbiota and exercise. Exercise can change gut microbiota numerically and qualitatively, which may be partially responsible for the widespread benefits of regular physical activity on human health. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method to show areas of brain activity enabling the delineation of specific brain regions involved in neurocognitive disorders. Through combining exercise tasks and fMRI techniques, researchers can observe the effects of exercise on higher brain functions. However, exercise's effects on brain health via gut microbiota have been little studied. This article reviews and highlights the connections between these three interactions, which will help us to further understand the positive effects of exercise on brain health and provide new strategies and approaches for the prevention and treatment of brain diseases.",['Kang P; Wang AZ'],2024,"gut microbiota is a bidirectional neural, hormonal, and immune signaling pathway. the brain controls the nerve system, allowing complex emotional and cognitive activities. the effects of the microbiota on the brain occur through the production of neurotransmitters, hormones, and metabolites."
Puerarin mitigated LPS-ATP or HG-primed endothelial cells damage and diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease via ROS-NLRP3 signalling.,"The occurrence and development of diabetic vascular diseases are closely linked to inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction. Puerarin (Pue), the primary component of Pueraria lobata, possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties. However, its vasoprotective role remains elusive. Therefore, we investigated whether Pue can effectively protect against vascular damage induced by diabetes. In the study, Pue ameliorated lipopolysaccharide-adenosine triphosphate (LPS-ATP) or HG-primed cytotoxicity and apoptosis, while inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in HUVECs, as evidenced by significantly decreased ROS level, NOX4, Caspase-1 activity and expression of NLRP3, GSDMD, cleaved caspase-1, IL-1β and IL-18. Meanwhile, ROS inducer CoCI<sub>2</sub> efficiently weakened the effects of Pue against LPS-ATP-primed pyroptosis. In addition, NLRP3 knockdown notably enhanced Pue's ability to suppress pyroptosis in LPS-ATP-primed HUVECs, whereas overexpression of NLRP3 reversed the inhibitory effects of Pue. Furthermore, Pue inhibited the expression of ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins on the aorta in type 2 diabetes mellitus rats. Our findings indicated that Pue might ameliorate LPS-ATP or HG-primed damage in HUVECs by inactivating the ROS-NLRP3 signalling pathway.",['Wei H; Sun M; Wang R; Zeng H; Zhao B; Jin S'],2024,occurrence and development of diabetes vascular diseases are closely linked to inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction. we investigated whether Pue can effectively protect against vascular damage induced by diabetes.
Representativeness of Participants in the ACCORD Trial Compared to Middle-aged and Older Adults Living with Diabetes in the United States.,"We evaluated whether participants in the landmark Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial represent U.S. adults aged ≥40 with diabetes. Using the nationally representative 2017-2020 pre-pandemic National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, we made operational definitions of ACCORD eligibility criteria. We calculated the percentage of individuals aged ≥40 with diabetes and HbA1c ≥6.0% or ≥7.5% who met operational ACCORD eligibility criteria. Applying survey sampling weights to 715 NHANES participants aged ≥40 with diabetes and HbA1c ≥6.0% (representing 29,717,406 individuals), 12% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-18%) met the operational ACCORD eligibility criteria. Restricting to HbA1c ≥7.5%, 39% (95% CI: 28-51%) of respondents met the ACCORD criteria. ACCORD represented a minority of U.S. middle-aged and older adults with diabetes. Given the differential risk profile between ACCORD participants and the general population with diabetes, extrapolating the trial findings may not be appropriate.",['Ikesu R; Wu Y; Zimmerman SC; Inoue K; Buto P; Power MC; Schaefer CA; Glymour MM; Mayeda ER'],2024,ACCORD was a landmark trial for adults aged 40 with diabetes.

Functional canonical RNAi in mice expressing a truncated Dicer isoform and long dsRNA.,"Canonical RNA interference (RNAi) is sequence-specific mRNA degradation guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) made by RNase III Dicer from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). RNAi roles include gene regulation, antiviral immunity or defense against transposable elements. In mammals, RNAi is constrained by Dicer's adaptation to produce another small RNA class-microRNAs. However, a truncated Dicer isoform (ΔHEL1) supporting RNAi exists in mouse oocytes. A homozygous mutation to express only the truncated ΔHEL1 variant causes dysregulation of microRNAs and perinatal lethality in mice. Here, we report the phenotype and canonical RNAi activity in Dicer<sup>ΔHEL1/wt</sup> mice, which are viable, show minimal miRNome changes, but their endogenous siRNA levels are an order of magnitude higher. We show that siRNA production in vivo is limited by available dsRNA, but not by Protein kinase R, a dsRNA sensor of innate immunity. dsRNA expression from a transgene yields sufficient siRNA levels to induce efficient RNAi in heart and muscle. Dicer<sup>ΔHEL1/wt</sup> mice with enhanced canonical RNAi offer a platform for examining potential and limits of mammalian RNAi in vivo.",['Buccheri V; Pasulka J; Malik R; Loubalova Z; Taborska E; Horvat F; Roos Kulmann MI; Jenickova I; Prochazka J; Sedlacek R; Svoboda P'],2024,RNAi is a sequence-specific mRNA degradation guided by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) made by RNase III Dicer from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) a truncated Dicer isoform (HEL1) supporting RNAi exists in mouse oocytes. a homozygous mutation to express only the truncated HEL1 variant causes dysregulation of microRNAs and perinatal le
Discovery of Novel p53-MDM2 Inhibitor (RG7388)-Conjugated Platinum<sup>IV</sup> Complexes as Potent Antitumor Agents.,"While a number of p53-MDM2 inhibitors have progressed into clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, their progression has been hampered by a variety of problems, including acquired drug resistance, dose-dependent toxicity, and limited clinical efficiency. To make more progress, we integrated the advantages of MDM2 inhibitors and platinum drugs to construct novel Pt<sup>IV</sup>-RG7388 (a selective MDM2 inhibitor) complexes. Most complexes, especially <b>5a</b> and <b>5b</b>, displayed greatly improved antiproliferative activity against both wild-type and mutated p53 cancer cells. Remarkably, <b>5a</b> exhibited potent <i>in vivo</i> tumor growth inhibition in the A549 xenograft model (66.5%) without apparent toxicity. It arrested the cell cycle at both the S phase and the G2/M phase and efficiently induced apoptosis via the synergistic effects of RG7388 and cisplatin.

Mutant p53 reactivators protect breast cancer cells from ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis is a novel nonapoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent reactive oxygen species-mediated lipid peroxidation. In several different cell systems, the tumor suppressor p53 can enhance sensitivity to ferroptotic inducers. At least half of all human cancers show loss of function of p53. Furthermore, many of those tumors express mutant forms of p53 that has lost its wild-type function. Several groups have designed small molecules that can reactivate the wild-type function of these missense p53 mutants. We reasoned that p53 reactivators may also enhance sensitivity of certain cancer cells to ferroptosis stimuli. To test this idea we combined a number of different p53 reactivators with small molecule inducers of ferroptosis. In contrast, we observed that several p53 reactivators protected cells from cell death induced by ferroptotic inducers. Surprisingly, this protection still occurred in p53-null cell lines. We observed that these reactivators were neither free radical scavengers nor ion chelators. One of these p53 reactivator molecules, NSC 59984, reduced expression of GPX4, which is unlikely to explain its ability to reduce sensitivity to ferroptosis. We suggest that these p53 reactivators function via an unknown, p53-independent manner to suppress ferroptosis.",['Rathnayake DS; Dlamini S; Elkalawozgy K; Tillekeratne LMV; Taylor WR'],2024,p53 reactivators can enhance sensitivity to ferroptotic inducers. at least half of all human cancers show loss of function of p53. p53 reactivators may also enhance sensitivity of certain cancer cells.
Modifying the Basicity of the dNTP Leaving Group Modulates Precatalytic Conformational Changes of DNA Polymerase β.,"The catalytic function of DNA polymerase β (pol β) fulfills the gap-filling requirement of the base excision DNA repair pathway by incorporating a single nucleotide into a gapped DNA substrate resulting from the removal of damaged DNA bases. Most importantly, pol β can select the correct nucleotide from a pool of similarly structured nucleotides to incorporate into DNA in order to prevent the accumulation of mutations in the genome. Pol β is likely to employ various mechanisms for substrate selection. Here, we use dCTP analogues that have been modified at the β,γ-bridging group of the triphosphate moiety to monitor the effect of leaving group basicity of the incoming nucleotide on precatalytic conformational changes, which are important for catalysis and selectivity. It has been previously shown that there is a linear free energy relationship between leaving group p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> and the chemical transition state. Our results indicate that there is a similar relationship with the rate of a precatalytic conformational change, specifically, the closing of the fingers subdomain of pol β. In addition, by utilizing analogue β,γ-CHX stereoisomers, we identified that the orientation of the β,γ-bridging group relative to R183 is important for the rate of fingers closing, which directly influences chemistry.",['Alnajjar KS; Wang K; Alvarado-Cruz I; Chavira C; Negahbani A; Nakhjiri M; Minard C; Garcia-Barboza B; Kashemirov BA; McKenna CE; Goodman MF; Sweasy JB'],2024,pol  can select the correct nucleotide from a pool of similarly structured nucleotides to incorporate into DNA. pol  is likely to employ various mechanisms for substrate selection.
Effectiveness of artificial intelligence vs. human coaching in diabetes prevention: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Prediabetes is a highly prevalent condition that heralds an increased risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, along with associated microvascular and macrovascular complications. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is an established effective intervention for diabetes prevention. However, participation in this 12-month lifestyle change program has historically been low. Digital DPPs have emerged as a scalable alternative, accessible asynchronously and recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Yet, most digital programs still incorporate human coaching, potentially limiting scalability. Furthermore, existing effectiveness results of digital DPPs are primarily derived from per protocol, longitudinal non-randomized studies, or comparisons to control groups that do not represent the standard of care DPP. The potential of an AI-powered DPP as an alternative to the DPP is yet to be investigated. We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to directly compare these two approaches. This open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority RCT will compare the effectiveness of a fully automated AI-powered digital DPP (ai-DPP) with a standard of care human coach-based DPP (h-DPP). A total of 368 participants with elevated body mass index (BMI) and prediabetes will be randomized equally to the ai-DPP (smartphone app and Bluetooth-enabled body weight scale) or h-DPP (referral to a CDC recognized DPP). The primary endpoint, assessed at 12 months, is the achievement of the CDC's benchmark for type 2 diabetes risk reduction, defined as any of the following: at least 5% weight loss, at least 4% weight loss and at least 150 min per week on average of physical activity, or at least a 0.2-point reduction in hemoglobin A1C. Physical activity will be objectively measured using serial actigraphy at baseline and at 1-month intervals throughout the trial. Secondary endpoints, evaluated at 6 and 12 months, will include changes in A1C, weight, physical activity measures, program engagement, and cost-effectiveness. Participants include adults aged 18-75 years with laboratory confirmed prediabetes, a BMI of ≥ 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (≥ 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for Asians), English proficiency, and smartphone users. This U.S. study is conducted at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, MD, and Reading Hospital (Tower Health) in Reading, PA. Prediabetes is a significant public health issue, necessitating scalable interventions for the millions affected. Our pragmatic clinical trial is unique in directly comparing a fully automated AI-powered approach without direct human coach interaction. If proven effective, it could be a scalable, cost-effective strategy. This trial will offer vital insights into both AI and human coach-based behavioral change strategies in real-world clinical settings. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05056376.

Legionella effector LnaB is a phosphoryl-AMPylase that impairs phosphosignalling.,"AMPylation is a posttranslational modification that generally modifies amino acid side chains of proteins with adenosine monophosphate (AMP)<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we report that with ATP as the ligand and actin as the host activator, the effector protein LnaB of Legionella pneumophila exhibits AMPylase activity toward the phosphoryl group of phosphoribose on PR<sup>R42</sup>-Ub that is generated by the SidE family effectors and deubiquitinases DupA/B in an E1/E2-independent ubiquitination process<sup>3-7</sup>. The product of LnaB is further hydrolyzed by an ADP-ribosyl hydrolase, MavL, to be Ub, thereby preventing accumulation of PR<sup>R42</sup>-Ub and ADPR<sup>R42</sup>-Ub and protecting the canonical ubiquitination in host cells. LnaB represents a large family of AMPylases adopting a common structural fold, which is distinct from those of the previously known AMPylases, in bacterial pathogens of more than 20 species. Moreover, LnaB also exhibits robust phosphoryl AMPylase activity toward phosphorylated residues and produces unique ADPylation modification in proteins. During infection, LnaB AMPylates the conserved phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the Src family kinases<sup>8,9</sup>, which dampens the host downstream phosphorylation signaling. Structural studies revealed the actin-dependent activation and catalytic mechanisms of the LnaB family of AMPylases. This study presents an unprecedented regulation and molecular mechanism in bacterial pathogenesis and protein phosphorylation.",['Wang T; Song X; Tan J; Xian W; Zhou X; Yu M; Wang X; Xu Y; Wu T; Yuan K; Ran Y; Yang B; Fan G; Liu X; Zhou Y; Zhu Y'],2024,AMPylation is a posttranslational modification that generally modifies amino acid side chains of proteins with adenosine monophosphate (AMP). the effector protein LnaB of Legionella pneumophila exhibits AMPylase activity toward the phosphoryl group of phosphoribose on PRsup>R42/sup>-Ub. the product of LnaB is further hydrolyzed by an ADP-ribosyl
TRIM65 promotes renal cell carcinoma through ubiquitination and degradation of BTG3.,"As a typical E3 ligase, TRIM65 (tripartite motif containing 65) is involved in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity and the pathogenesis of certain tumors. However, the role of TRIM65 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and the underlying mechanism has not been determined yet. In this study, we identified TRIM65 as a novel oncogene in RCC, which enhanced the tumor cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth abilities both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that TRIM65-regulated RCC proliferation mainly via direct interaction with BTG3 (BTG anti-proliferation factor 3), which in turn induced the K48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation through K41 amino acid. Furthermore, TRIM65 relieved G2/M phase cell cycle arrest via degradation of BTG3 and regulated downstream factors. Further studies revealed that TRIM65 acts through TRIM65-BTG3-CyclinD1 axis and clinical sample IHC chip data indicated a negative correction between TRIM65 and BTG3. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that TRIM65 promotes RCC cell proliferation via regulation of the cell cycle through degradation of BTG3, suggesting that TRIM65 may be a promising target for RCC therapy.",['Zhang Q; Li Y; Zhu Q; Xie T; Xiao Y; Zhang F; Li N; Deng K; Xin H; Huang X'],2024,TRIM65 is involved in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity.

MRTO4 Enhances Glycolysis to Facilitate HCC Progression by Inhibiting ALDOB.,"BACKGROUND MRT4 Homolog, Ribosome Maturation Factor (MRTO4) is often upregulated in cancer cells. However, its impact in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is less well understood. Herein, we explored the prognostic and energy metabolism reprogramming role of MRTO4 in HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS Clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the expression of MRTO4 in clinical samples was analyzed. The association between different variables and overall survival (OS) was studied, as well as their potential as independent prognostic factors, using Cox regression analysis. We constructed a nomogram including clinical pathological variables and MRTO4 expression to provide a predictive model for prognosis. Heatmaps, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed the relationship between energy metabolism pathways and MRTO4. We used classic molecular biology research methods, including RT-qPCR, Western blotting, CCK8, TUNEL, Clone formation, Transwell assay, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry, to study the role of MRTO4 in promoting the progression of HCC through glycolysis regulation. RESULTS Our study showed that MRTO4 is an independent prognostic risk factor for HCC and that MRTO4 accelerates glycolysis of HCC cells, promotes proliferation and invasion, and suppresses apoptosis of HCC cells. The underlying mechanism involves MRTO4 promoting glycolysis and accelerating HCC by inhibiting ALDOB. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which MRTO4 promotes glycolysis and accelerates HCC progression, and suggests that inhibiting MRTO4 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC.",['Zheng Y; Huang Y; Li W; Cheng H'],2024,"BACKGROUND MRT4 Homolog, Ribosome Maturation Factor (MRTO4) is often upregulated in cancer cells. but its impact in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is less well understood."

Harmine exhibits anti-apoptotic properties and reduces diabetes-induced testicular damage caused by streptozotocin in rats.,"Diabetes mellitus induces fertility problems in men, mainly because of increased free radicals. Natural resources are effective for male infertility treatment. This study investigated the effects of harmine, an alkaloid available in Peganum harmala L., on the male reproductive system of diabetic rats. We divided 32 rats into four groups, and eight were randomly placed in each group. For diabetes induction, the animals received 50 mg/kg of streptozotocin intraperitoneally. After 1 week, animals received 15 mg/kg of harmine (28 days; intraperitoneal). Histopathological examinations, serum levels of male hormones, levels of nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the testes, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), insulin serum levels, fasting blood glucose levels, the apoptotic index, and semen analysis were assessed. The diabetes group exhibited morphological changes in testicular tissue, significant decreases in the diameter of the seminiferous tubule, the Johnsen score, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, insulin serum levels, and TAC in testicular tissue (p<0.01). Harmine treatment ameliorated the morphological changes in the testes and improved sperm parameters relative to the diabetes group (p<0.05). The NO and MDA levels in the testes, fasting blood glucose serum levels, and apoptotic index parameters were significantly elevated in the diabetes group, while in the diabetes+harmine group, these parameters were reduced (p<0.01).

The relationship between low prolactin and type 2 diabetes.,"Prolactin (PRL) is secreted throughout life in men and women. At elevated levels, its physiological role in pregnancy and lactation, and pathological effects, are well known. However clinical implications of low circulating PRL are not well established. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between low PRL levels and type 2 diabetes. Five papers included cross-sectional studies comprising 8,720 men (mean age range 51.4-60 years) and 3,429 women (49.5-61.6 years), and four papers included cohort studies comprising 2,948 men (52.1-60.0 years) and 3,203 women (49.2-60.1 years). Individuals with pregnancy, lactation and hyperprolactinemia, drugs known to alter circulating PRL levels, or pituitary diseases had been excluded. Although most studies used quartiles to categorize PRL groups for analysis, PRL cut-off values (all measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay) were variably defined between studies: the lowest PRL quartiles ranged from 3.6 ng/ml to 7.2 ng/ml in men and between 4.5 ng/ml to 8 ng/ml in women; and the highest PRL quartiles ranged from 6.9 ng/ml to 13 ng/ml in men and 9.6 ng/ml to 15.8 ng/ml in women. Type 2 diabetes was defined variably using self-reported physician's diagnosis, fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test or glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>). In cross-sectional studies, compared to individuals in the highest PRL groups (reference), those in the lowest PRL groups had greater risk of type 2 diabetes both in men: odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval = 1.86 (1.56-2.22) and in women: OR = 2.15 (1.63-2.85). In cohort studies, women showed a significant association between low PRL and type 2 diabetes: OR = 1.52 (1.02-2.28) but not men: OR = 1.44 (0.46-4.57). Relatively low heterogeneity was observed (I<sup>2</sup> = 25-38.4%) for cross-sectional studies, but higher for cohort studies (I<sup>2</sup> = 52.8-79.7%). In conclusion, low PRL is associated with type 2 diabetes, but discrepancy between men and women in the relationship within cohort studies requires further research.",['Ken-Dror G; Fluck D; Lean MEJ; Casanueva FF; Han TS'],2024,a meta-analysis of low circulating PRL and type 2 diabetes was conducted. the lowest PRL quartiles ranged from 3.6 ng/ml to 7.2 ng/ml in men. the highest PRL quartiles ranged from 6.9 ng/ml to 13 ng/ml in men and 9.6 ng/ml to 15.8 ng/ml in women.
Imaging of an exceptional urinoma complicating a cervical cancer and leading to death: A case report.,"Spontaneous urinoma is a rare urological complication that can occur following acute urinary obstruction. It involves a collection of urine that typically forms around the kidney as a result of rupture of the fornix. There are several causes of acute urinary stasis, including lithiasis, tumors, prostatic hypertrophy, and others. We present a unique case of an asymptomatic spontaneous urinoma discovered incidentally during the extension study of a 66-year-old woman with cervical cancer. The positive diagnosis was made through a combination of ultrasound and uro-computed tomography scan. The evolution was marked by the occurrence of a uremic encephalopathy, leading to death before any treatment.",['Haidar A; Andour H; Essaber H; Abdallah H; El Bakkari A; Allioui S; Omor Y; Latib R'],2024,"asymptomatic spontaneous urinoma was discovered during a cervical cancer study. it involves a collection of urine that typically forms around the kidney. there are several causes of acute urinary stasis, including lithiasis, tumors, prostatic hypertrophy, and others."
Fully automated workflow for integrated sample digestion and Evotip loading enabling high-throughput clinical proteomics.,"Protein identification and quantification is an important tool for biomarker discovery. With the increased sensitivity and speed of modern mass spectrometers, sample-preparation remains a bottleneck for studying large cohorts. To address this issue, we prepared and evaluated a simple and efficient workflow on the Opentrons OT-2 (OT-2) robot that combines sample digestion, cleanup and loading on Evotips in a fully automated manner, allowing the processing of up to 192 samples in 6 hours. Analysis of 192 automated HeLa cell sample preparations consistently identified ∼8000 protein groups and ∼130,000 peptide precursors with an 11.5 minute active LC gradient with the Evosep One and narrow-window data-independent acquisition with the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer providing a throughput of 100-samples-per-day. Our results demonstrate a highly sensitive workflow yielding both reproducibility and stability at low sample inputs. The workflow is optimized for minimal sample starting amount to reduce the costs for reagents needed for sample preparation, which is critical when analyzing large biological cohorts. Building on the digesting workflow, we incorporated an automated phosphopeptide enrichment step using magnetic Ti-IMAC beads. This allows for a fully automated proteome and phosphoproteome sample preparation in a single step with high sensitivity. Using the integrated digestion and Evotip loading workflow, we evaluated the effects of cancer immune therapy on the plasma proteome in metastatic melanoma patients.",['Kverneland AH; Harking F; Vej-Nielsen JM; Huusfeldt M; Bekker-Jensen DB; Svane IM; Bache N; Olsen JV'],2024,"a simple and efficient workflow on the Opentrons OT-2 (OT-2) robot combines sample digestion, cleanup and loading on Evotips in a fully automated manner. the workflow is optimized for minimal sample starting amount to reduce the costs for reagents needed for sample preparation."
Effects of diabetes mellitus on retreatment of Tuberculosis: A multi-centered case-control study from Bangladesh.,"Several studies suggested that diabetes mellitus (DM) worsens the tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcome. But information regarding the association of DM with retreatment of TB is very scarce in Bangladesh. Present study aimed to assess the effects of DM on retreatment of TB. This case-control study was conducted among 254 patients (127 cases and 127 controls) from January 2022 - December 2022. Patients were recruited by purposive sampling from 92 centers of the Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS). Data were collected by face-to-face interview and record reviewing with the help of semi-structured questionnaire and checklist respectively. Quality of data was maintained in all stages of the study. Data were analyzed by using IBM SPSS software. Informed written consent was taken from each patient prior to the study. Ethical issues were maintained strictly. Present study matched the age and sex of cases and controls. The study revealed that majority of case (89.0) and controls (97.6) were married. Among cases 78.0 % had DM and among controls 64.6 % had DM. Among diabetic patients, 78.8 % cases' and 64.6 % controls' HbA1C level was not within normal range. The study found that, the number of episodes of previous TB (AOR = 3.088, ρ = 0.019), presence of DM (AOR = 2.817, ρ = 0.012) and uncontrolled HbA1C level (AOR = 2.500, ρ = 0.028) were independently associated with retreatment of TB. The study found that presence of DM, uncontrolled HbA1C level and multiple episodes of previous TB were the risk factors for retreatment of TB.

"Chromatic visual evoked potentials: a review of physiology, methods and clinical applications.","Objective assessment of the visual system can be performed electrophysiologically using the visual evoked potential (VEP). In many clinical circumstances, this is performed using high contrast achromatic patterns or diffuse flash stimuli. These methods are clinically valuable but they may only assess a subset of possible physiological circuitries within the visual system, particularly those involved in achromatic (luminance) processing. The use of chromatic VEPs (cVEPs) in addition to standard VEPs can inform us of the function or dysfunction of chromatic pathways. The chromatic VEP has been well studied in human health and disease. Yet, to date our knowledge of their underlying mechanisms and applications remains limited. This likely reflects a heterogeneity in the methodology, analysis and conclusions of different works, which leads to ambiguity in their clinical use. This review sought to identify the primary methodologies employed for recording cVEPs. Furthermore cVEP maturation and application in understanding the function of the chromatic system under healthy and diseased conditions are reviewed. We first briefly describe the physiology of normal colour vision, before describing the methodologies and historical developments which have led to our understanding of cVEPs. We thereafter describe the expected maturation of the cVEP, followed by reviewing their application in several disorders: congenital colour vision deficiencies, retinal disease, glaucoma, optic nerve and neurological disorders, diabetes, amblyopia and dyslexia. We finalise the review with recommendations for testing and future directions.",['Marmoy OR; Tekavcic Pompe M; Kremers J'],2024,cVEPs are well studied in human health and disease. but to date our knowledge of their mechanisms and applications remains limited.
Physical activity and sedentary behaviour of Bahraini people with type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study.,"Study patterns of physical activity and sedentary behaviour and the influence of demographics and body mass index (BMI) on these behaviours amongst Bahraini adults with type 2 diabetes over 10 weeks using an activity tracker. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at a Bahrain government health centre. Thirty-three Bahraini Arab adults, 30-60 years old, with controlled type 2 diabetes, wore a Fitbit Flex 2<sup>TM</sup> activity tracker for 10 weeks. Data on age, sex, marital and employment status, education and BMI were collected at the start of the study. A total of <i>N</i> = 32 participants completed the study. The average steps per day were 7859 ± 4131, and there were no differences between baseline, week 5 and 10. A third of participants were sedentary, based on a threshold of 5000 steps/day. Females accumulated fewer average daily steps than males (6728 ± 2936 vs. 10,281 ± 4623, <i>p</i> = 0.018). Daily averages for physical activity intensity were as follows: sedentary (786 ± 109 min), light (250 ± 76 min), moderate (9 ± 10 min) and vigorous (12 ± 18 min). Males had higher daily averages versus females for moderate (13 ± 9 vs. 5 ± 9 min, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and vigorous physical activity (21 ± 23 vs. 5 ± 7 min, <i>p</i> = 0.034). 91% of participants wore the device ≥10 h/day. The adherence rate was 79% based on percentage of days the device was worn continuously over 10 weeks.

Comprehensive assessment of ocular parameters for identifying diagnostic indicators of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.,"To explore variations in systemic and ocular parameters among patients with diabetes, both with and without diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and to identify sensitive indicators for DPN diagnosis. Ninty-five patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were involved in this cross-sectional study, including 49 without DPN and 46 with DPN. Ocular parameters were obtained using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM). Patients with DPN presented with significantly higher HbA1c (p < 0.05) and glycated albumin (GA, p < 0.01) levels, increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR, p < 0.05), and lower serum albumin (ALB, p < 0.01) and red blood cell (RBC, p < 0.05) levels. Ocular assessments revealed reduced corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL, p < 0.001) and enlarged foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area (p < 0.05) in DPN group. Logistic regression analysis indicated a significant association of presence of DR, RBC, GA, ALB, CNFL and DPN (p < 0.05, respectively). In the binary logistic regression for DPN risk, all three models including the presence of DR and CNFL exhibited the area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.8. The study establishes a strong correlation between ocular parameters and DPN, highlighting CCM's role in early diagnosis.

Beneficial effects of swimming and pomegranate juice in rats with hypertension: A possible role of serum adropin.,"Hypertension, characterized by persistent and uncontrolled high blood pressure, is one of the most common significant causes of mortality worldwide. Lifestyle modifications such as exercise and antioxidant intake have showed beneficial effects on hypertensive conditions. Adropin and endothelin-1 (ET-1) have important vasoregulatory functions in the endothelium. However, the underlying mechanisms linking exercise- and/or antioxidant intake-mediated improvement of hypertension are not fully understood. In this study, it was hypothesized that swimming exercise and pomegranate juice (PJ) (as an antioxidant) administration might have protective effects on hypertension development and possible involvements of serum adropin and ET-1. To test the hypothesis, the rats with hypertension, induced by Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, were subjected to swimming exercise and received PJ for 8 weeks. Weekly systolic and diastolic pressures, serum concentrations of adropin and ET-1, and oxidant/antioxidant parameters in various tissues were measured. The obtained data show that swimming exercise leads to complete protection against hypertension within the 8-week duration, whereas the PJ administration causes an ameliorative effect. In addition, the combination of swimming exercise and PJ administration do not have additive effects in protection against hypertension. Notably, the 8-week swimming exercise restores the diminished serum adropin concentration in rats with hypertension to the control level. Serum adropin significantly correlated with systolic and diastolic pressures, depending on swimming exercise, but not PJ administration. Serum ET-1 concentration inconsistently fluctuates in response to Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, swimming exercise, and PJ intake. In addition, swimming exercise and/or PJ administration lead to a complete normalization in liver malondialdehyde concentrations of rats with hypertension, whereas these interventions cause slight or no improvements in superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione in the heart, liver, and kidney. In conclusion, 8-week swimming exercise modulates hypertension, possibly by influencing adropin concentration and oxidative stress.",['Koc Yildirim E; Kaya M; Guler AG; Yildirim E; Ozturan YA; Uner AA'],2024,adropin and endothelin-1 (ET-1) have important vasoregulatory functions in the endothelium. but the mechanisms linking exercise- and antioxidant intake-mediated improvement of hypertension are not fully understood. swimming exercise and pomegranate juice (as an antioxidant) administration may have protective effects on hypertension development and possible involvement of serum adropin and ET-1.
Topical naltrexone increases aquaporin 5 production in the lacrimal gland and restores tear production in diabetic rats.,"Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease that is often accompanied by ocular surface abnormalities including delayed epithelial wound healing and decreased corneal sensitivity. The impact of diabetes on the lacrimal functional unit (LFU) and the structures responsible for maintaining tear homeostasis, is not completely known. It has been shown that the Opioid Growth Factor Receptor (OGFr), and its ligand, Opioid Growth Factor (OGF), is dysregulated in the ocular surface of diabetic rats leading to overproduction of the inhibitory growth peptide OGF. The opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride (NTX) blocks the OGF-OGFr pathway, and complete blockade following systemic or topical treatment with NTX restores the rate of re-epithelialization of corneal epithelial wounds, normalizes corneal sensitivity, and reverses dry eye in diabetic animal models. These effects occur rapidly and within days of initiating treatment. The present study was designed to understand mechanisms related to the fast reversal (<5 days) of dry eye by NTX in type 1 diabetes (T1D) by investigating dysregulation of the LFU. The approach involved examination of the morphology of the LFU before and after NTX treatment. Male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered hyperglycemic with streptozotocin, and after 6 weeks rats were considered to be a T1D model. Rats received topical NTX twice daily to one eye for 10 days. During the period of treatment, tear production and corneal sensitivity were recorded. On day 11, animals were euthanized and orbital tissues including conjunctiva, eyelids, and lacrimal glands, were removed and processed for histologic examination including immunohistochemistry. Male and female T1D rats had significantly decreased tear production and corneal insensitivity, significantly decreased number and size of lacrimal gland acini, decreased expression of aquaporin-5 (AQP5) protein and decreased goblet cell size. Thus, 10 days of NTX treatment restored tear production and corneal sensitivity to normal values, increased AQP5 expression, and restored the surface area of goblet cells to normal. NTX had no effect on the number of lacrimal gland acini or the number of conjunctival goblet cells. In summary, blockade of the OGF-OGFr pathway with NTX reversed corneal and lacrimal gland complications and restored some components of tear homeostasis confirming the efficacy of topical NTX as a treatment for ocular defects in diabetes.",['Diaz D; Sassani JP; Zagon IS; McLaughlin PJ'],2024,diabetes mellitus is a prevalent disease that is often accompanied by ocular surface abnormalities. the impact of diabetes on the lacrimal functional unit (LFU) and the structures responsible for maintaining tear homeostasis is not completely known.
Use of Natural Language Understanding to Facilitate Surgical De-Escalation of Axillary Staging in Patients With Breast Cancer.,"Natural language understanding (NLU) may be particularly well equipped for enhanced data capture from the electronic health record given its examination of both content-driven and context-driven extraction. We developed and applied a NLU model to examine rates of pathological node positivity (pN+) and rates of lymphedema to determine whether omission of routine axillary staging could be extended to younger patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/cN0 disease. We found that rates of pN+ and arm lymphedema were similar between patients age 55-69 years and ≥70 years, with rates of lymphedema exceeding rates of pN+ for clinical stage T1c and smaller disease. Data from our NLU model suggest that omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy might be extended beyond Choosing Wisely recommendations, limited to those older than 70 years and to all postmenopausal women with early-stage ER+/cN0 disease. These data support the recently reported SOUND trial results and provide additional granularity to facilitate surgical de-escalation.",['Carleton N; Saadawi G; McAuliffe PF; Soran A; Oesterreich S; Lee AV; Diego EJ'],2024,a model was developed to examine rates of pathological node positivity (pN+) and rates of lymphedema. the model suggests omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy might be extended beyond Choosing Wisely recommendations.
Unraveling the Complexity of DNA Radiation Damage Using DNA Nanotechnology.,"ConspectusRadiation cancer therapies use different ionizing radiation qualities that damage DNA molecules in tumor cells by a yet not completely understood plethora of mechanisms and processes. While the direct action of the radiation is significant, the byproducts of the water radiolysis, mainly secondary low-energy electrons (LEEs, <20 eV) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), can also efficiently cause DNA damage, in terms of DNA strand breakage or DNA interstrand cross-linking. As a result, these types of DNA damage evolve into mutations hindering DNA replication, leading to cancer cell death. Concomitant chemo-radiotherapy explores the addition of radiosensitizing therapeutics commonly targeting DNA, such as platinum derivatives and halogenated nucleosides, to enhance the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on the DNA molecule. Further complicating the landscape of DNA damage are secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes occurring in telomeric DNA. These structures protect DNA from radiation damage, rendering them as promising targets for new and more selective cancer radiation treatments, rather than targeting linear DNA. However, despite extensive research, there is no single paradigm approach to understanding the mysterious way in which ionizing radiation causes DNA damage. This is due to the multidisciplinary nature of the field of research, which deals with multiple levels of biological organization, from the molecular building blocks of life toward cells and organisms, as well as with complex multiscale radiation-induced effects. Also, intrinsic DNA features, such as DNA topology and specific oligonucleotide sequences, strongly influence its response to damage from ionizing radiation. In this Account, we present our studies focused on the absolute quantification of photon- and low-energy electron-induced DNA damage in strategically selected target DNA sequences. Our methodology involves using DNA origami nanostructures, specifically the Rothemund triangle, as a platform to expose DNA sequences to either low-energy electrons or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV, <15 eV) photons and subsequent atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Through this approach, the effects of the DNA sequence, incorporation of halogenated radiosensitizers, DNA topology, and the radiation quality on radiation-induced DNA strand breakage have been systematically assessed and correlated with fundamental photon- and electron-driven mechanisms underlying DNA radiation damage. At lower energies, these mechanisms include dissociative electron attachment (DEA), where electrons attach to DNA molecules causing strand breaks, and dissociative photoexcitation of DNA. Additionally, further dissociative processes such as photoionization and electron impact contribute to the complex cascade of DNA damage events induced by ionizing radiation. We expect that emerging DNA origami-based approaches will lead to a paradigm shift in research fields associated with DNA damage and suggest future directions, which can foster the development of technological applications in nanomedicine, e.g., optimized cancer treatments or the molecular design of optimized radiosensitizing therapeutics.",['Ameixa J; Bald I'],2024,ionizing radiation damage is a plethora of mechanisms and processes. the radiation damage is caused by a yet not completely understood plethora of mechanisms and processes. ionizing radiation can damage DNA molecules in tumor cells.
ABO and Rhesus blood groups and multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies.,"Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood groups and various health outcomes. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of these associations is still lacking. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and several regional databases from their inception until Feb 16, 2024, with the aim of identifying systematic reviews with meta-analyses of observational studies exploring associations between ABO and Rh blood groups and diverse health outcomes. For each association, we calculated the summary effect sizes, corresponding 95% confidence intervals, 95% prediction interval, heterogeneity, small-study effect, and evaluation of excess significance bias. The evidence was evaluated on a grading scale that ranged from convincing (Class I) to weak (Class IV). We assessed the certainty of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria (GRADE). We also evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). AMSTAR contains 11 items, which were scored as high (8-11), moderate (4-7), and low (0-3) quality. We have gotten the registration for protocol on the PROSPERO database (CRD42023409547). The current umbrella review included 51 systematic reviews with meta-analysis articles with 270 associations. We re-calculated each association and found only one convincing evidence (Class I) for an association between blood group B and type 2 diabetes mellitus risk compared with the non-B blood group. It had a summary odds ratio of 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.40), was supported by 6870 cases with small heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 13%) and 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and without hints of small-study effects (P for Egger's test > 0.10, but the largest study effect was not more conservative than the summary effect size) or excess of significance (P < 0.10, but the value of observed less than expected). And the article was demonstrated with high methodological quality using AMSTAR (score = 9). According to AMSTAR, 18, 32, and 11 studies were categorized as high, moderate, and low quality, respectively. Nine statistically significant associations reached moderate quality based on GRADE.

A comprehensive analysis of POLE/POLD1 genomic alterations in colorectal cancer.,"Pathogenic mutations in POLE/POLD1 lead to decreased fidelity of DNA replication, resulting in a high tumor mutational burden (TMB-H), defined as TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb, independent of deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) and microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) status. De-identified records of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) profiled with the Tempus xT assay (DNA-seq of 595-648 genes at 500×) were identified from the Tempus Database. Among 9136 CRC samples profiled, the frequency of POLE/POLD1 genomic alterations was 2.4% (n = 217). Copy number loss was the most common genomic alteration (64%, n = 138) of POLE/POLD1, followed by copy number amplifications (18%, n = 40) and short variant mutations (18%, n = 39). The POLE/POLD1 mutated group presented with a higher frequency of TMB-H phenotype relative to wild type (WT; 22% vs. 9%, P < .001), with a median TMB of 127 mut/Mb in the TMB-H POLE/POLD1 subset. The TMB showed a dramatic contrast between POLE/POLD1 short variant mutations as compared to the group with copy number alterations, with a TMB of 159 mut/Mb vs 15 mut/Mb, respectively. Thus, the short variant mutations represented the so-called ultra-hypermutated phenotype. The POLE/POLD1 mutated group, as compared to WT, exhibited a higher rate of coexisting mutations, including APC, ALK, ATM, BRCA2, and RET mutations. Patients with POLE/POLD1 mutations exhibited significant differences across immunological markers (ie, TMB, MMR, and MSI-H) and molecular co-alterations. Those with short variant mutations represented 18% of the POLE/POLD1 cohort and 0.4% of the total cohort examined. This group of patients had a median TMB of 159 mut/Mb (range 34-488), representing the ultra-hypermutated phenotype.

Assessment between antiseptic and normal saline for negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time in diabetic foot infections.,"Negative pressure wound therapy with instillation and dwell time (NPWTi-d) is increasingly used for a diverse range of wounds. Meanwhile, the topical wound irrigation solution consisting of polyhexamethylene biguanide and betaine (PHMB-B) has shown efficacy in managing wound infections. However, the effectiveness of this solution as a topical instillation solution for NPWTi-d in patients with diabetic foot infections (DFIs) has not been thoroughly studied. The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of using PHMB-B as the instillation solution during NPWTi-d on reducing bioburden and improving clinical outcomes in patients with DFIs. Between January 2017 and December 2022, a series of patients with DFIs received treatment with NPWTi-d, using either PHMB-B or normal saline as the instillation solution. Data collected retrospectively included demographic information, baseline wound characteristics, and treatment outcomes. The study included 61 patients in the PHMB-B group and 73 patients in the normal saline group, all diagnosed with DFIs. In comparison to patients treated with normal saline, patients with PHMB-B exhibited no significant differences in terms of wound bed preparation time (P = 0.5034), length of hospital stay (P = 0.6783), NPWTi-d application times (P = 0.1458), duration of systematic antimicrobial administration (P = 0.3567), or overall cost of hospitalization (P = 0.6713).

We aimed to determine whether individuals with HDP history have coronary microvascular dysfunction measured by coronary flow reserve 8 to 10 years after delivery and whether microvascular dysfunction correlates with LV remodeling. Individuals with pregnancies delivered from 2008 to 2010 underwent burst-replenishment myocardial contrast echocardiography (2017-2020) to quantify myocardial perfusion at rest and during dobutamine stress. Video intensity versus time data were used to derive β, the rate of rise of video intensity, a correlate for myocardial blood flow. Coronary flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of β at peak stress to β at rest, averaged across LV myocardial regions of interest. We studied 91 individuals (aged 38±6 and 9.1±0.9 years postdelivery) and 19 with a history of HDP. Individuals with coronary microvascular dysfunction (coronary flow reserve <2.0; n=13) had a higher proportion of HDP (46.2% versus 16.7%; <i>P</i>=0.026) and higher prepregnancy body mass index, baseline heart rate, and hemoglobin A1c compared with those without microvascular dysfunction. The association of coronary flow reserve and HDP was attenuated after adjusting for cardiometabolic factors (<i>P</i>=0.133). In exploratory subgroup analyses, individuals with both LV remodeling (relative wall thickness >0.42) and HDP (n=12) had the highest proportion of microvascular dysfunction (41.7% versus +HDP-LV remodeling [n=7] 14.3%; -HDP+LV remodeling [n=26] 7.7%; <i>P</i>=0.0498). In this small study, HDP history is associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction 1 decade after delivery, findings that may, in part, be driven by metabolic factors including obesity and diabetes. Microvascular dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular disease among individuals with a history of HDP.",['Countouris ME; Catov JM; Zhu J; de Jong N; Brands J; Chen X; Parks WT; Berlacher KL; Gandley RE; Straub AC; Villanueva FS'],2024,coronary microvascular disease is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling. a link between myocardial microvascular disease and LV remodeling is unknown.
Optimizing care in early phase cancer trials: The role of palliative care.,"Advancements in cancer treatment have led to improved survival rates, with early phase clinical trials (EPCTs) serving as important initial steps in evaluating novel therapies. Recent studies have shown that response rates in these trials have doubled in the last twenty years. Patients who enroll on EPCTs have advanced cancer and heightened symptomatology yet maintain a robust performance status that qualifies them for clinical trial participation. It is well established that many of these patients have needs that can be addressed by palliative care, including symptom management, value assessments, advance care planning, and psychosocial and spiritual support. Several small studies have aimed to identify the most beneficial palliative care intervention for this cohort of patients, ranging from formal clinic-based multidisciplinary palliative care interventions to home-based interventions. While outcomes have trended towards benefit for patients, especially pertaining to psychological well-being, most studies were not powered to detect additional benefits for improved physical symptom management, reduction in care utilization or increased length of time on trial. In this review, we discuss the unique palliative care needs of this population and what we can learn from results of past interventional studies. We advocate for a tailored palliative care approach that acknowledges the time toxicity experienced by patients enrolled in EPCTs and address challenges posed by shortages within the palliative care workforce.",['Crowley F; Sheppard R; Lehrman S; Easton E; Marron TU; Doroshow D; Afezolli D'],2024,"early phase clinical trials (EPCTs) have shown that response rates in these trials have doubled in the last twenty years. many of these patients have needs that can be addressed by palliative care, including symptom management, value assessments, advance care planning, and psychosocial and spiritual support."
Cardioprotective effects of vaccination in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,"COVID-19 vaccination has been shown to prevent and reduce the severity of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this study was to explore the cardioprotective effect of COVID-19 vaccination in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In this retrospective, single-center cohort study, we included hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed vaccination status from July 2021 to February 2022. We assessed outcomes such as acute cardiac events and cardiac biomarker levels through clinical and laboratory data. Our analysis covered 167 patients (69% male, mean age 58 years, 42% being fully vaccinated). After adjustment for confounders, vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients displayed a reduced relative risk for acute cardiac events (RR: 0.33, 95% CI [0.07; 0.75]) and showed diminished troponin T levels (Cohen's d: - 0.52, 95% CI [- 1.01; - 0.14]), compared to their non-vaccinated peers. Type 2 diabetes (OR: 2.99, 95% CI [1.22; 7.35]) and existing cardiac diseases (OR: 4.31, 95% CI [1.83; 10.74]) were identified as significant risk factors for the emergence of acute cardiac events. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination may confer both direct and indirect cardioprotective effects in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",['Madrid J; Agarwal P; Müller-Peltzer K; Benning L; Selig M; Rolauffs B; Diehl P; Kalbhenn J; Trummer G; Utzolino S; Wengenmayer T; Busch HJ; Stolz D; Rieg S; Panning M; Bamberg F; Schlett CL; Askani E'],2024,the aim of this study was to explore the cardioprotective effect of COVID-19 vaccination in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. the study included hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed vaccination status from July 2021 to February 2022.
Construction and evaluation of short<b>-</b>term and long<b>-</b>term mortality risk prediction model for patients with sepsis based on MIMIC<b>-</b>IV database.,"Given the high incidence and mortality rate of sepsis, early identification of high-risk patients and timely intervention are crucial. However, existing mortality risk prediction models still have shortcomings in terms of operation, applicability, and evaluation on long-term prognosis. This study aims to investigate the risk factors for death in patients with sepsis, and to construct the prediction model of short-term and long-term mortality risk. Patients meeting sepsis 3.0 diagnostic criteria were selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database and randomly divided into a modeling group and a validation group at a ratio of 7꞉3. Baseline data of patients were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis and full subset regression were used to determine the risk factors of death in patients with sepsis and to screen out the variables to construct the prediction model. The time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve were used to evaluate the differentiation, calibration, and clinical practicability of the model. A total of 14 240 patients with sepsis were included in our study. The 28-day and 1-year mortality were 21.45% (3 054 cases) and 36.50% (5 198 cases), respectively. Advanced age, female, high sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, high simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II), rapid heart rate, rapid respiratory rate, septic shock, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, malignant tumor, high white blood cell count (WBC), long prothrombin time (PT), and high serum creatinine (SCr) levels were all risk factors for sepsis death (all <i>P</i><0.05). Eight variables, including PT, respiratory rate, body temperature, malignant tumor, liver disease, septic shock, SAPS II, and age were used to construct the model. The AUCs for 28-day and 1-year survival were 0.717 (95% <i>CI</i> 0.710 to 0.724) and 0.716 (95% <i>CI</i> 0.707 to 0.725), respectively.

Effects of ON101 for Hard-to-Heal Diabetic Foot Ulcers in A Randomized Phase III Trial: A Post hoc Analysis.,"Hard-to-heal diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are associated with higher mortality rates and an increased medical burden for patients. ON101, a new topical cream, exhibited better healing efficacy than the control dressing in a Phase III trial. In this post-hoc analysis, we further identify whether ON101 can improve the healing of ulcers with hard-to-heal risk factors in this cohort of DFU patients. To compare the efficacy of ON101 with absorbent dressing among various hard-to-heal wounds in patients with DFU, a post hoc analysis of a randomized phase III trial included 276 DFU patients was performed by subgrouping those patients based on ulcer depth, location, size, duration, and patients' glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and body mass index (BMI). In the full analysis set, the proportion of patients achieving healing was 61.7% in the ON101 group and 37.0% in the comparator (P =0.0001). In sub-group analysis according to risk factors, ON101 demonstrated superior healing capacity on Wagner grade 2 ulcers (P < 0.0001); plantar ulcers (P = 0.0016), ulcers size ≥5 cm² (P = 0.0122), ulcers duration ≥3 months (P = 0.0043); for patients with HbA1c ≥9% (P = 0.0285); and patients with BMI ≥25 (P = 0.0005). ON101, a novel therapeutic drug, can modulate the functions of macrophages and demonstrate superior healing rates to conventional absorbent dressing in patients with hard-to-heal DFUs. The results of this post hoc study suggest that ON101 is a better therapeutic option than conventional dressing used in treatment for DFU patients with higher HbA1c, BMI, or ulcers with complex conditions such as longer duration, deeper wounds, larger size, and plantar location.",['Chang SC; Lin CW; Chen JC; Wu YH; Chen SG; Huang YY; Cheng NC; Cazzell SM; Chen HH; Huang KF; Tung KY; Huang HL; Perng CK; Shi B; Liu C; Ma Y; Cao Y; Li Y; Xue Y; Gao F; Cao Y; Yan L; Li Q; Armstrong DG; Ning G'],2024,ON101 showed better healing efficacy than control dressing in phase III trial. a post hoc analysis of a randomized phase III trial included 276 DFU patients. the proportion of patients achieving healing was 61.7% in the ON101 group.
Performance of subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring in adult critically ill patients receiving vasopressor therapy.,"Background Subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may facilitate glucose control in the ICU. We aimed to assess the accuracy of CGM (Dexcom G6) against arterial blood glucose (ABG) in adult critically ill patients receiving intravenous insulin infusion and vasopressor therapy. We also aimed to assess feasibility and tolerability of CGM in this setting. Methods We included ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation, insulin, and vasopressor therapy. Numerical accuracy was assessed by the mean absolute relative difference (MARD), overall, across arterial glucose strata, over different noradrenaline equivalent infusion rates, and over time since CGM start. MARD below 14% was considered acceptable. Clinical accuracy was assessed using Clarke Error Grid (CEG) analysis. Feasibility outcome included number and duration of interrupted sensor readings due to signal loss. Tolerability outcome included skin reactions related to sensor insertion or sensor adhesives. Results We obtained 2946 paired samples from 40 patients (18 with type 2 diabetes) receiving a median (IQR) maximum noradrenaline equivalent infusion rate of 0.18 (0.08-0.33) µg/kg/min during CGM. Overall, MARD was 12.7 (95% CI 10.7-15.3) % and 99.8% of CGM readings were within CEG zones A and B. MARD values ≥14% were observed when ABG was outside target range (6-10 mmol/l [108-180 mg/dl]) and with noradrenaline equivalent infusion rates above 0.10 µg/kg/min. Accuracy improved with time after CGM start, reaching MARD values below 14% after 36 hours. We observed four episodes of interrupted sensor readings due to signal loss ranging from 5 to 20 minutes. We observed no skin reactions related to sensor insertion or sensor adhesives. Conclusions In our ICU cohort of patients receiving vasopressor infusion, subcutaneous CGM demonstrated acceptable overall numerical and clinical accuracy. However, suboptimal accuracy may occur outside glucose ranges of 6-10 mmol/l (108-180 mg/dl), during higher dose vasopressor infusion, and during the first 36 hours after CGM start.",['Friman O; Soltani N; Lind M; Zetterqvist P; Balintescu A; Perner A; Oldner A; Rooyackers O; Mårtensson J'],2024,we aimed to assess the accuracy of CGM against arterial blood glucose. we included adult critically ill patients receiving intravenous insulin infusion and vasopressor therapy.
"Life Goal Domains, Traits, and Setting Process in the Collaboration between Healthcare Professionals and Cancer Survivors: A Scoping Review.",": This study aimed to describe the classification of goal domains, goal traits, and the goal-setting process as revealed by previous life goal-setting practices of healthcare professionals collaborating with cancer survivors. : The design was a scoping review. The MEDLINE, Academic Search Premier, and CINAHL databases were searched and mapped for papers with descriptions of goal domains, goal traits, and the goal-setting process. Goal domains were classified as life goals that were health-related, psychological, social, achievement-related, and leisure goals. Goal traits were classified based on specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timed (SMART) criteria. The goal-setting process was classified based on the frameworks of goal-setting phases (preparation, formulation, follow-up) and their components. : In total, 229 papers were identified, and 24 papers were included in the final analysis. All papers included health-related goals, followed by psychological and social goals. All goal domains were included in 41.7% of the papers. Relevant goals were the most common and timed goals were the least common. All papers included either of the components that comprise the preparation or formulation phases. We found that 12.5% of papers did not include any of the three components of the follow-up phase. : The life goals collaboratively set between cancer survivors and healthcare professionals were characterized by the following: psychological and social goal domains, numerous goal domains, more relevant goals and fewer timed goals, low proportion of patient education in the preparation phase, and high proportion of evaluation of progress or achievement in the follow-up phase.",['Ikeuchi K; Nishida S; Karikawa M'],2024,"goal domains, goal traits, and the goal-setting process were classified as life goals that were health-related, psychological, social, achievement-related, and leisure goals. goals were classified based on specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timed criteria."
Integrating optical and electrical sensing with machine learning for advanced particle characterization.,"Particle classification plays a crucial role in various scientific and technological applications, such as differentiating between bacteria and viruses in healthcare applications or identifying and classifying cancer cells. This technique requires accurate and efficient analysis of particle properties. In this study, we investigated the integration of electrical and optical features through a multimodal approach for particle classification. Machine learning classifier algorithms were applied to evaluate the impact of combining these measurements. Our results demonstrate the superiority of the multimodal approach over analyzing electrical or optical features independently. We achieved an average test accuracy of 94.9% by integrating both modalities, compared to 66.4% for electrical features alone and 90.7% for optical features alone. This highlights the complementary nature of electrical and optical information and its potential for enhancing classification performance. By leveraging electrical sensing and optical imaging techniques, our multimodal approach provides deeper insights into particle properties and offers a more comprehensive understanding of complex biological systems.",['Kokabi M; Tayyab M; Rather GM; Pournadali Khamseh A; Cheng D; DeMauro EP; Javanmard M'],2024,a multimodal approach for particle classification requires accurate and efficient analysis of particle properties. results demonstrate superiority of the multimodal approach over analyzing electrical or optical features independently.
Long-term weight loss of distal gastric bypass is moderately superior compared to proximal gastric bypass in patients with a BMI of 37-44 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>.,"The laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is one of the standard procedures in metabolic surgery. Different limb lengths have been proposed in the past to maximize weight loss (WL) and reduce metabolic complications. Distal gastric bypass surgery with a very short common channel (CC) (up to 100 cm) has been often criticized due to frequent side effects such as malnutrition, bone weakening and short-bowel syndrome. We introduced a modified version of a distal LRYGB with a 50-70 cm long biliopancreatic limb (BPL) and an intermediate short CC (120-150 cm). Our primary goal was to compare the long-term WL between distal and proximal LRYGB in two cohorts of patients. Secondary outcomes were weight regain (WR), insufficient weight loss (IWL), postoperative complications and metabolic changes 5 years after surgery. In this retrospective study we collected data from 160 patients operated between 2014 and 2015, with a BMI of 37-44 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. 101 patients underwent a distal and 59 patients a proximal LRYGB in two bariatric centers. WL was calculated as percent of excess of BMI loss (%EBMIL), loss of body mass index (Delta-BMI), percent of excess weight loss (%EWL) and percent of total weight loss (%TWL). Data were collected 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 48 and 60 months after surgery. The distal LRYGB resulted in significantly better 5-year-WL compared to the proximal bypass in terms of %EBMIL (median at 5 years: 83% vs. 65%, p = 0.001), %TWL (median at 5 years: 32% vs. 26%, p = 0.017) and %EWL (median at 5 years: 65% vs. 51%, p = 0.029), with equal major complications and metabolic alterations. In addition, WR was significantly lower in patients with distal bypass (18% vs. 35%, p = 0.032). Distal LYRGB with a 120-150 long CC results in better WL and WL-maintenance compared to proximal LRYGB without major side effects after five years.",['Cereser T; Heil J; Schöb O; Schlumpf R; Gantert WA; Infanger D; Böckmann M; Beissner P; Bach-Kliegel B; Potoczna N; Schiesser M'],2024,"distal gastric bypass surgery with a very short common channel (up to 100 cm) has been often criticized due to frequent side effects such as malnutrition, bone weakening and short-bowel syndrome. the laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is one of the standard procedures in metabolic surgery."
Crizotinib enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy in ovarian cancer cells and xenograft models by inducing autophagy.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) can encounter resistance through various mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness. Our recent research showed that PARPi alone can induce drug resistance by promoting autophagy. Moreover, our studies have revealed that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) plays a role in regulating the survival of ovarian cancer cells undergoing autophagy. Here, we explored whether the ALK-inhibitor crizotinib could enhance the efficacy of PARPi by targeting drug-induced autophagic ovarian cancer cell and xenograft models. Our investigation demonstrates that crizotinib enhances the anti-tumor activity of PARPi across multiple ovarian cancer cells. Combination therapy with crizotinib and olaparib reduced cell viability and clonogenic growth in two-olaparib resistant cell lines. More importantly, this effect was consistently observed in patient-derived organoids. Furthermore, combined treatment with crizotinib and olaparib led to tumor regression in human ovarian xenograft models. Mechanistically, the combination resulted in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induced DNA damage, and decreased the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and ULK-1, contributing to increased olaparib-induced autophagy and apoptosis. Notably, pharmacologic, or genetic inhibition or autophagy reduced the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines to olaparib and crizotinib treatment, underscoring the role of autophagy in cell death. Blocking ROS mitigated olaparib/crizotinib-induced autophagy and cell death while restoring levels of phosphorylated AKT, mTOR and ULK-1. These findings suggest that crizotinib can improve the therapeutic efficacy of olaparib by enhancing autophagy. Implications: The combination of crizotinib and PARPi presents a promising strategy, that could provide a novel approach to enhance outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer.","[""Santiago-O'Farrill JM; Blessing Bollu A; Yang H; Orellana V; Pina M; Zhang X; Liu J; Bast RC; Lu Z""]",2024,polymerase inhibitors can encounter resistance through various mechanisms. our research showed that PARPi alone can induce drug resistance by promoting autophagy.

However, it remains unclear whether such benefits extend to humans. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to clarify the effect of L. plantarum supplementation on glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM and prediabetes. The PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled mean difference with 95% CI (confidence interval).

"Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, vitamin D-binding protein levels, and diabetes mellitus: Two-sample Mendelian randomization.","Studies have suggested that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with the occurrence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and that vitamin D-binding proteins (VDBP) are necessary for metabolic stress in pancreatic α-cells. However, the causal relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels, VDBP, and the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) remains unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to investigate the causal relationship between 25(OH)D, VDBP, and DM. Relevant recent data were downloaded from the NHGRI-EBI Catalog of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and filtered for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We used multiple MR methods, including inverse variance weighting (IVW), and performed sensitivity analyses to detect whether pleiotropy or heterogeneity biased the results. There was a causal relationship between genetically predicted VDBP levels and serum 25(OH)D levels, and serum 25(OH)D levels increased with increasing VDBP levels (IVW: β = 0.111, OR = 1.117, 95% CI:1.076-1.162, P = 1.41 × 10-8).

Role of Healthy Lifestyle and Diet Quality in the Development of Colorectal Cancer in the Adult Population in the Kurdistan Region: A Case-Control Study.,"Background The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasing in developing countries. The factors contributing to the risk of CRC are not known in developing countries. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the role of a healthy lifestyle on CRC in the adult population in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Methodology In this case-control investigation, patients previously diagnosed with CRC were included as cases (n = 84) and the healthy adult population as healthy controls (n = 87). The patients were selected from the Gastroenterology Unit of Azadi Teaching Hospital and Emergency Teaching Hospital. The healthy controls were selected from the caregivers of patients who met the eligibility criteria. Results Individuals with a history of chronic disease (63.08% vs. 40.52%; p = 0.0043), a history of hypertension (71.74% vs. 40.80%; p = 0.0003), and a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (59.42% vs. 42.16%; p = 0.0267) had a significantly higher prevalence of CRC compared to healthy controls. CRC patients had significantly lower diet quality scores than healthy controls (36.27 vs. 37.83; p = 0.0002). The study showed that CRC patients had a significantly lower lifestyle index score compared to healthy controls (10.20 vs. 11.69; p = 0.0002). In addition, CRC patients had lower scores for diet (0.42 vs. 1.00; p < 0.0001), smoking (2.92 vs. 4.0; p < 0.0001), and physical activity (1.02 vs. 1.70; p < 0.0001) compared to healthy controls. However, CRC patients and healthy controls had similar alcohol index scores (5.0 vs. 530; p = 1.000) and body mass index (1.04 vs. 1.01; p = 0.8982).

Baicalin suppresses macrophage JNK-mediated adipose tissue inflammation to mitigate insulin resistance in obesity.,"Radix scutellariae (the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to treat a wide range of inflammation-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, diabetic kidney disease, and COVID-19-associated inflammatory states in the lung and kidney. Baicalin is the major anti-inflammatory component of Radix scutellariae and has shown the potential to inhibit inflammation in metabolic disorders. In this study, we explored the ability and underlying mechanisms of baicalin to modulate the macrophage to mitigate insulin resistance in obesity. Obese mice were administered baicalin (50 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 3 weeks. RAW264.7 and BMDM cells were stimulated with LPS and treated with baicalin for 24 h, while 3T3-L1 and primary white adipocytes were treated with the supernatants from baicalin-treated RAW264.7 cells for 24 h. The results showed that baicalin significantly improved glucose and insulin tolerance as well as decreased fat and adipose tissue macrophage levels in obese mice. Besides, baicalin significantly reduced serum and adipose tissue IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 levels in obese mice, as well as suppressed LPS-induced IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 expression and release in macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with the supernatant from baicalin-treated RAW264.7 cells increased the levels of PGC-1α, SIRT1, p-IRS-1 and p-AKT in adipocytes. Moreover, baicalin treatment dramatically downregulated macrophage p-p38, p-JNK, and Ac-p65<sup>Lys310</sup> levels while increasing SIRT1 both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, JNK inhibitor SP600125 blocked most of the effects of baicalin on SIRT1, Ac-p65<sup>Lys310</sup> and pro-inflammatory factors in macrophages. Therefore, these results demonstrated for the first time that baicalin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in obese adipose tissue macrophages mainly through suppressing JNK/SIRT1/p65 signaling. These findings amplified the mechanisms of baicalin and its potential to attenuate insulin resistance.",['Zhu Z; Yu M; Xu M; Ji X; Zong X; Zhang Z; Shang W; Zhang L; Fang P'],2024,a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat inflammation-related diseases. the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a traditional Chinese medicine. the anti-inflammatory component of Radix scutellariae has shown the potential to inhibit inflammation in metabolic disorders.
Effects of antidiabetic agents on platelet characteristics with implications in Alzheimer's disease: Mendelian randomization and colocalization study.,"Observational studies have found a potential link between the use of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. Platelets were the great source of amyloid-β (Aβ) and involved in the development of AD. This study aimed to assess the correlation between antidiabetic agents and platelet characteristics, hoping to provide a potential mechanism of TZDs neuroprotection in AD. Drug-targeted Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to systematically illustrate the long-term effects of antidiabetic agents on platelet characteristics. Four antidiabetic agent targets were considered. Positive control analysis for type 2 diabetes (T2D) was conducted to validate the selection of instrumental variables (IVs). Colocalization analysis was used to further strengthen the robustness of the results. Positive control analysis showed an association of four antidiabetic agents with lower risk of T2D, which was consistent with their mechanisms of action and previous evidence from clinical trials. Genetically proxied TZDs were associated with lower platelet count (β[IRNT] = -0.410 [95 % CI -0.533 to -0.288], <i>P</i> = 5.32E-11) and a lower plateletcrit (β[IRNT] = -0.344 [95 % CI -0.481 to -0.206], <i>P</i> = 1.04E-6). Colocalization suggested the posterior probability of hypothesis 4 (PPH4) > 0.8, which further strengthened the MR results. Genetically proxied TZDs were causally associated with lower platelet characteristics, particularly platelet count and plateletcrit, providing insight into the involvement of platelet-related pathways in the neuroprotection of TZDs against AD. Future studies are warranted to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of TZDs' neuroprotective effects through platelet pathways.",['Xie Z; Liu Y; Huang M; Zhong S; Lai W'],2024,observational studies have found a link between TZDs and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) development.

"Generalization of Odd Ramos-Louzada generated family of distributions: Properties, characterizations, and applications to diabetes and cancer survival datasets.","Probability distributions offer the best description of survival data and as a result, various lifetime models have been proposed. However, some of these survival datasets are not followed or sufficiently fitted by the existing proposed probability distributions. This paper presents a novel Kumaraswamy Odd Ramos-Louzada-G (KumORL-G) family of distributions together with its statistical features, including the quantile function, moments, probability-weighted moments, order statistics, and entropy measures. Some relevant characterizations were obtained using the hazard rate function and the ratio of two truncated moments. In light of the proposed KumORL-G family, a five-parameter sub-model, the Kumaraswamy Odd Ramos-Louzada Burr XII (KumORLBXII) distribution was introduced and its parameters were determined with the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique. Monte Carlo simulation was performed and the numerical results were used to evaluate the MLE technique. The proposed probability distribution's significance and applicability were empirically demonstrated using various complete and censored datasets on the survival times of cancer and diabetes patients. The analytical results showed that the KumORLBXII distribution performed well in practice in comparison to its sub-models and several other competing distributions. The new KumORL-G for diabetes and cancer survival data is found extremely efficient and offers an enhanced and novel technique for modeling survival datasets.",['Okutu JK; Frempong NK; Appiah SK; Adebanji AO'],2024,the proposed probability distributions are not followed or sufficiently fitted by the existing proposed probability distributions. the new KumORL-G for diabetes and cancer survival data is found extremely efficient and offers an enhanced and novel technique for modeling survival datasets.
Substitution of Dairy Products and Risk of Death and Cardiometabolic Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies.,"Substitution models in epidemiologic studies specifying both substitute and substituted food in relation to disease risk may be useful to inform dietary guidelines. A systematic review of prospective observational studies was performed to quantify the risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) associated with the substitution of dairy products with other foods and between different dairy products. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science until 28th June, 2023. We calculated summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) in random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the risk of bias with the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Exposure (ROBINS-E) tool and certainty of evidence (CoE) using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach. Fifteen studies (with 34 publications) were included. There was moderate CoE that the substitution of low-fat dairy with red meat was associated with a higher risk of mortality, coronary artery disease, and T2D [SRR (95% CI): 1.11 (1.06, 1.16), 1.13 (1.08, 1.18), and 1.20 (1.16, 1.25)]. A higher risk of mortality and T2D was also observed when substituting low-fat dairy with processed meat [SRR (95% CI): 1.19 (1.11, 1.28) and 1.41 (1.33, 1.49); moderate CoE]. A lower mortality risk was associated with the substitution of dairy and yogurt with whole grains [SRR (95% CI): 0.89 (0.84, 0.93) and 0.91 (0.85, 0.97)], and butter with olive oil [SRR (95% CI): 0.94 (0.92, 0.97); all moderate CoE]. Mainly no associations were observed when substituting dairy products against each other on disease and mortality risk. Our findings indicate associations between substituting dairy with red or processed meat and higher disease risk, whereas its substitution with whole grains was associated with a lower risk. However, there is little robust evidence that substituting whole-fat with low-fat dairy is associated with disease risk.

"Targeting skeletal muscle health with exercise in people with type 1 diabetes: A protocol for HOMET1D, a prospective observational trial with matched controls.","Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience a complex set of alterations to skeletal muscle metabolic, neuromuscular, and vascular health; collectively referred to as diabetic myopathy. While the full scope of diabetic myopathy is still being elucidated, evidence suggests that even when individuals with T1D are physically active, indices of myopathy still exist. As such, there is a question if adherence to current physical activity guidelines elicits improvements in skeletal muscle health indices similarly between individuals with and without T1D. The objectives of this trial are to: 1) compare baseline differences in skeletal muscle health between adults with and without T1D, 2) examine the association between participation in a home-based exercise program, detraining, and retraining, with changes in skeletal muscle health, and 3) examine the roles of age and sex on these associations. This will be a prospective interventional trial. Younger (18-30 years) and older (45-65 years) males and females with T1D and matched individuals without T1D will engage in a four-phase, 18-week study sequentially consisting of a one-week lead-in period, 12-week exercise training program, one-week detraining period, and four-week retraining period. The exercise program will consist of aerobic and resistance exercise based on current guidelines set by Diabetes Canada. Metabolic, neuromuscular, and vascular outcome measures will be assessed four times: at baseline, post-exercise program, post-detraining, and post-retraining. Differences in baseline metrics between those with and without T1D will be examined with independent sample t-tests, and with two-way analyses of variance for age- and sex-stratified analyses. Changes across the duration of the study will be examined using mixed-model analyses. Findings from this research will be shared locally and internationally with research participants, clinicians, diabetes educators, and patient advocacy organizations via in-person presentations, social media, and scientific fora.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 3 Screen Islet Cell Autoantibody in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.,"In recent years, the emergence of multiplex technology that can simultaneously measure multiple anti-islet autoantibodies has become particularly valuable for the staging and early diagnosis of immune-mediated type 1 diabetes (T1D). While it has been established that 20%-30% of T1D patients suffer from autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), there is limited available data regarding the presence of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients. Among commercially available anti-islet autoantibodies, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies (GADAs) are often the first marker measured in general clinical practice. To investigate the frequency of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients. Our study involved four hundred ninety-five AITD patients, categorized into three distinct groups: AITD with T1D (<i>n</i> = 18), AITD with phenotypic type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<i>n</i> = 81), and AITD without diabetes (<i>n</i> = 396), and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to determine the frequencies of 3 Screen Islet Cell Autoantibody (3 Screen ICA), GADA, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 autoantibodies (IA-2As), and zinc transporter 8 autoantibodies (ZnT8As) within these groups. The frequency of 3 Screen ICA in AITD patients with T1D, T2D, and those without diabetes were 88.9%, 6.2%, and 5.1%, respectively, with no significant difference seen between the latter two groups. Notably, the frequency of 3 Screen ICA was 11.1% higher in AITD patients with T1D, 1.3% higher in AITD patients with T2D, and 1.1% higher in AITD patients without diabetes compared to GADA, respectively. Furthermore, 12.5%, 20.0%, and 20.0% of the 3 Screen ICA-positive patients were negative for GADA. Additionally, 1.3% of the AITD patients who tested negative for 3 Screen ICA in both the AITD with T2D and non-diabetic AITD groups were found to be positive for individual autoantibodies. Among the 3 Screen ICA-positive patients, there was a significantly higher proportion of individuals with multiple autoantibodies in AITD patients with T1D compared to those without diabetes (37.5% <i>vs</i> 5.0%, <i>P</i> < 0.05). However, this proportion was similar to that in AITD patients with T2D (20.0%). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in 3 Screen ICA titers between AITD patients with T1D and those without diabetes (436.8 ± 66.4 <i>vs</i> 308.1 ± 66.4 index). Additionally, no significant difference in 3 Screen ICA titers was observed between Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in any of the groups. Our findings reveal that some AITD patients without diabetes exhibit 3 Screen ICA titers comparable to those in AITD patients with T1D. Thus, 3 Screen ICA outperforms GADA in identifying latent anti-islet autoantibody-positive individuals among AITD patients.",['Kawasaki E; Tamai H; Fukuyama T; Sagara Y; Hidaka R; Uchida A; Tojikubo M; Tatsumoto N; Akehi Y; Hiromatsu Y'],2024,emergence of multiplex technology has become particularly valuable for the staging and early diagnosis of immune-mediated type 1 diabetes (T1D) there is limited available data regarding the presence of anti-islet autoantibodies in AITD patients.
Pancreas Transplantation Outcome Predictions-PTOP: A Risk Prediction Tool for Pancreas and Pancreas-Kidney Transplants Based on a European Cohort.,"For patients with complicated type 1 diabetes having, for example, hypoglycemia unawareness and end-stage renal disease because of diabetic nephropathy, combined pancreas and kidney transplantation (PKT) is the therapy of choice. However, the shortage of available grafts and complex impact of risk factors call for individualized, impartial predictions of PKT and pancreas transplantation (PT) outcomes to support physicians in graft acceptance decisions. Based on a large European cohort with 3060 PKT and PT performed between 2006 and 2021, the 3 primary patient outcomes time to patient mortality, pancreas graft loss, and kidney graft loss were visualized using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were developed for 5- and 10-y prediction of outcomes based on 26 risk factors. Risk factors associated with increased mortality included previous kidney transplants, rescue allocations, longer waiting times, and simultaneous transplants of other organs. Increased pancreas graft loss was positively associated with higher recipient body mass index and donor age and negatively associated with simultaneous transplants of kidneys and other organs. Donor age was also associated with increased kidney graft losses. The multivariable Cox models reported median C-index values were 63% for patient mortality, 62% for pancreas loss, and 55% for kidney loss. This study provides an online risk tool at https://riskcalc.org/ptop for individual 5- and 10-y post-PKT and PT patient outcomes based on parameters available at the time of graft offer to support critical organ acceptance decisions and encourage external validation in independent populations.",['Miller G; Ankerst DP; Kattan MW; Hüser N; Stocker F; Vogelaar S; van Bruchem M; Assfalg V'],2024,"pancreas and kidney transplantation (PKT) are the therapy of choice. but the shortage of available grafts and complex impact of risk factors call for individualized, impartial predictions of outcomes. multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were developed for 5- and 10-y prediction of outcomes based on 26 risk factors."
Recent advances in the effect of adipose tissue inflammation on insulin resistance.,"Obesity is one of the major risk factors for diabetes. Excessive accumulation of fat leads to inflammation of adipose tissue, which can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Obesity-related chronic inflammation can result in anomalies in glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, and it is a major cause of β-cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Thus, a long-term tissue inflammatory response is crucial for metabolic diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes. Chronic inflammation associated with obesity increases oxidative stress, secretes inflammatory factors, modifies endocrine variables, and interferes with insulin signalling pathways, all of which contribute to insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Insulin resistance and diabetes are ultimately caused by chronic inflammation in the stomach, pancreas, liver, muscle, and fat tissues. In this article, we systematically summarize the latest research progress on the mechanisms of adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, as well as the mechanisms of cross-talk between adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance, with a view to providing some meaningful therapeutic strategies for the treatment of insulin resistance by controlling adipose tissue inflammation.",['Yan K'],2024,"chronic inflammation can result in anomalies in glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance. inflammation associated with obesity increases oxidative stress, secretes inflammatory factors, modifies endocrine variables, and interferes with insulin signalling pathways."
Platelet-mediated circulating tumor cell evasion from natural killer cell killing via immune checkpoint CD155-TIGIT.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are precursors of cancer metastasis. However, how CTCs evade immunosurveillance during hematogenous dissemination remains unclear. We identified CTC-platelet adhesions by single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence of blood samples from multiple cancer types. Clinically, CTC-platelet aggregates were associated with significantly shorter progression-free survival and overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays demonstrated direct platelet adhesions gifted cancer cells with an evasive ability from natural killer (NK) cell killing by upregulating inhibitory checkpoint CD155, therefore facilitating distant metastasis. Mechanistically, CD155 was transcriptionally regulated by the FAK/JNK/c-Jun cascade in a platelet contact-dependent manner. Further competition assays and cytotoxicity experiments revealed that CD155 on CTCs inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity only by engaging with immune receptor TIGIT, but not CD96 and DNAM1, another two receptors for CD155. Interrupting the CD155-TIGIT interactions with a TIGIT antibody restored NK cell immunosurveillance on CTCs and markedly attenuated tumor metastasis. Our results demonstrated CTC evasion from NK cell-mediated innate immunosurveillance mainly via immune checkpoint CD155-TIGIT, potentially offering an immunotherapeutic strategy for eradicating CTCs.",['Sun Y; Li T; Ding L; Wang J; Chen C; Liu T; Liu Y; Li Q; Wang C; Huo R; Wang H; Tian T; Zhang C; Pan B; Zhou J; Fan J; Yang X; Yang W; Wang B; Guo W'],2024,hepatocellular carcinoma patients were able to develop a hepatocellular carcinoma. a cytotoxicity experiment revealed that CD155 inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity only by engaging with immune receptor TIGIT. a cytotoxicity experiment revealed that CD155 on CTCs inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity.
Biobehavioral approach to distinguishing panic symptoms from medical illness.,"Panic disorder is a common psychiatric diagnosis characterized by acute, distressing somatic symptoms that mimic medically-relevant symptoms. As a result, individuals with panic disorder overutilize personal and healthcare resources in an attempt to diagnose and treat physical symptoms that are often medically benign. A biobehavioral perspective on these symptoms is needed that integrates psychological and medical knowledge to avoid costly treatments and prolonged suffering. This narrative review examines six common somatic symptoms of panic attacks (non-cardiac chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, abdominal distress, and paresthesia), identified in the literature as the most severe, prevalent, or critical for differential diagnosis in somatic illness, including long COVID. We review somatic illnesses that are commonly comorbid or produce panic-like symptoms, their relevant risk factors, characteristics that assist in distinguishing them from panic, and treatment approaches that are typical for these conditions. Additionally, this review discusses key factors, including cultural considerations, to assist healthcare professionals in differentiating benign from medically relevant symptoms in panic sufferers.",['Tunnell NC; Corner SE; Roque AD; Kroll JL; Ritz T; Meuret AE'],2024,"panic disorder is a common psychiatric diagnosis characterized by acute, distressing somatic symptoms that mimic medically-relevant symptoms. a biobehavioral perspective on these symptoms is needed to avoid costly treatments and prolonged suffering."
Cancer Incidence After Diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,"Epidemiological and mechanistic data support a potential causal link between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) represent a common form of CVD with at least partially distinct genetic and biologic etiology from other forms of CVD. The risk of cancer and how this risk differs compared with other forms of CVD, is unknown among AAA patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the IBM MarketScan Research Database to test whether individuals with AAA have a higher cancer risk independent of traditional shared risk factors. All individuals ≥18 years of age with ≥36 months of continuous coverage between 2008 and 2020 were enrolled. Those with potential Mendelian etiologies of AAA, aortic aneurysm with nonspecific anatomic location, or a cancer diagnosis before the start of follow-up were excluded. A subgroup analysis was performed of individuals having the Health Risk Assessment records including tobacco use and body mass index. The following groups of individuals were compared: (1) with AAA, (2) with non-AAA CVD, and (3) without any CVD. The propensity score-matched cohort included 58 993 individuals with AAA, 117 986 with non-AAA CVD, and 58 993 without CVD. The 5-year cumulative incidence of cancer was 13.1% (12.8%-13.5%) in participants with AAA, 10.1% (9.9%-10.3%) in participants with non-AAA CVD, and 9.6% (9.3%-9.9%) in participants without CVD. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models found that patients with AAA exhibited a higher cancer risk than either those with non-AAA CVD (hazard ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.23-1.32]; <i>P</i><0.001) or those without CVD (hazard ratio, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.26-1.38]; <i>P</i><0.001). Results remained consistent after excluding common smoking-related cancers and when adjusting for tobacco use and body mass index. Patients with AAA may have a unique risk of cancer requiring further mechanistic study and investigation of the role of enhanced cancer screening.",['Luo L; Haas AM; Bell CF; Baylis RA; Adkar SS; Fu C; Angelov I; Giordano SH; Klarin D; Leeper NJ; Nead KT'],2024,a retrospective cohort study was conducted using the IBM MarketScan Research Database. the risk of cancer is unknown among AAA patients. a subgroup analysis was performed of individuals having the Health Risk Assessment records including tobacco use and body mass index.
Depletion of SLC7A11 Sensitizes Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells to Ionizing Radiation.,"Radiotherapy is the primary treatment choice for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). However, its efficacy is compromised due to radioresistance. Ferroptosis, a novel iron-dependent regulated cell death induced by Ionizing Radiation (IR), plays a role in promoting cancer cell death. Yet, the relationship between enhanced ferroptosis and increased sensitivity of NPC cells to IR remains poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the association between IR and ferroptosis in NPC, as well as the role of the ferroptosis repressor SLC7A11 in IR-treated NPC cells. CNE1 and HNE-2 NPC cells were subjected to IR treatment. We performed qPCR and western blotting to evaluate the expression of ferroptosis-related genes in both control and IR-treated NPC cells. Additionally, we used the MTT assay to measure the viability of these NPC cells. JC-1 and DCFH-DA staining were employed to assess mitochondrial membrane potential and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels in both control and IR-treated NPC cells. Furthermore, we examined the levels of Fe2+, Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced Glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in these cells. Moreover, we depleted SLC7A11 in IR-treated NPC cells to investigate its impact on the ferroptosis of these cells. IR upregulated the expression of ferroptosis-related genes, including SLC7A11, ACSL4, COX2, FTH1, and GPX4, in CNE1 and HNE-2 cells. IR treatment also resulted in decreased cell viability, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS levels, altered glutathione levels, and elevated Fe2+ levels. Knockdown of SLC7A11 enhanced the sensitivity of NPC cells to IR. IR may induce ferroptosis in NPC cells, and stimulating ferroptosis could potentially serve as a therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of IR in treating NPC patients.",['Yang F; Gong H; Chen S; Li J; Huang N; Wang M'],2024,radiotherapy is the primary treatment choice for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. but its efficacy is compromised due to radioresistance. ferroptosis plays a role in promoting cancer cell death.
Toward a more patient-centered drug development process in clinical trials for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS): Practical considerations from the International Consortium for MDS (icMDS).,"Notable treatment advances have been made in recent years for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS), and several new drugs are under development. For example, the emerging availability of oral MDS therapies holds the promise of improving patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Within this rapidly evolving landscape, the inclusion of HRQoL and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is critical to inform the benefit/risk assessment of new therapies or to assess whether patients live longer and better, for what will likely remain a largely incurable disease. We provide practical considerations to support investigators in generating high-quality PRO data in future MDS trials. We first describe several challenges that are to be thoughtfully considered when designing an MDS-focused clinical trial with a PRO endpoint. We then discuss aspects related to the design of the study, including PRO assessment strategies. We also discuss statistical approaches illustrating the potential value of time-to-event analyses and their implications within the estimand framework. Finally, based on a literature review of MDS randomized controlled trials with a PRO endpoint, we note the PRO items that deserve special attention when reporting future MDS trial results.

Autophagy-related ncRNAs: Regulatory Roles and Potential Therapeutic Effects in Digestive System Neoplasms.,"Among all cancers in the world, the incidence rate of digestive system neoplasms accounts for about 25%, while the mortality rate accounts for about 35%. Difficulty in detecting early digestive system cancers and its poor prognosis are the two main reasons for the high mortality rate. Understanding of the basic cellular processes is of significance and autophagy is one of these processes. Considering the importance of autophagy in pathological state functions, the mechanism of autophagy was initially carried out. In this paper, we will review the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of autophagy-associated ncRNAs in different types of digestive system cancers. Autophagy is a process that supports nutrient cycling and metabolic adaptation accomplished through multi-step lysosomal degradation. It has been suggested that autophagy has a dual role in cancer, which limits tumorigenesis in some stages but promotes tumor progression in others. NcRNAs are also shown to modulate cellular autophagy and thus affect the development of digestive system neoplasms. More and more evidence suggests that the regulation of autophagy by ncRNAs plays a complex role in cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, recurrence, and treatment resistance, which might make ncRNAs therapeutic targets for digestive system neoplasms. While miRNAs participate mainly in post-transcriptional regulation, lncRNAs, and circRNAs usually serve as molecular sponges that have more diverse regulatory functions.",['Wei L; Wu S; Lei X; Yang X'],2024,autophagy is a process that supports nutrient cycling and metabolic adaptation. it has been suggested that autophagy has a dual role in cancer.
5-Fluorouracil Induced Hypertriglyceridemia During the Colorectal Cancer Treatment in a Patient With Multifactorial Chylomicronemia Syndrome: A Case Report.,"The case of a 47-year-old female patient who underwent sigmoidectomy for metastatic colorectal cancer is reported. Treatment with capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil induced severe hypertriglyceridemia repeatedly. Based on laboratory tests and clinical evaluations, treatment was suggested by specialists. After treatment with capecitabine, the patient's triglycerides increased from 19.7 mmol/L to 42 mmol/L. It was proposed that the patient had multifactorial chylomicronemia syndrome triggered by secondary factors. Statins, fenofibrate, ezetimib, and metformin were added to the therapy. After metastases appeared, FOLFIRI (leucovorin calcium [folinic acid], 5-fluorouracil, and irinotecan hydrochloride) chemotherapy and biological treatment (cetuximab) followed and triglycerides increased to 55.3 mmol/L.

Long-term renal and cardiovascular risks of tacrolimus in patients with lupus nephritis.,"Despite continuous advancement, treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) remains challenging. Recent guidelines now include a regimen incorporating tacrolimus as a first-line treatment option. Even though tacrolimus is effective in combination with mycophenolate and corticosteroids, concerns remain regarding long-term use, given its association with increased cardiovascular risks including nephrotoxicity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in kidney transplant recipients. However, in LN, long-term evaluations and head-to-head comparisons are lacking and thus the safety profile remains ill-defined. We hypothesized that chronic toxicity also occurs in LN patients. Therefore, this study aimed to assess long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes of tacrolimus in LN patients. This observational cohort study examined adult LN patients treated with tacrolimus, assessing renal outcomes, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular events and the Framingham risk score. The results were compared to a control group of CNI-naïve LN patients. Of the 219 LN patients in this study, 43 (19.6%) had tacrolimus exposure. Over a median follow-up of 7.1 years, tacrolimus use was associated with significant kidney function decline (6.8 ml/min/1.73m2, versus 0.8 in the control group). The incidence of end-stage kidney disease was similar. Cardiovascular event incidence was equally low in both groups. The 10-year risk of coronary heart disease was lower in the tacrolimus group, primarily due to age differences. HbA1c levels were higher in the tacrolimus group (37.4 mmol/mol) than in controls (33.6 mmol/mol), although the incidence of diabetes was similar. There were no differences in the occurrence of hypertension or dyslipidemia. Our study demonstrated that tacrolimus exposure was associated with long-term kidney function loss in LN patients. Although cardiovascular risk factors and events were similar to patients never exposed to tacrolimus, there may be an increased risk of developing diabetes. Therefore, our study supports vigilance towards renal adverse effects in LN patients treated with tacrolimus.",['van Schaik M; Bredewold OW; Priester M; Michels WM; Rabelink TJ; Rotmans JI; Onno Teng YK'],2024,tacrolimus is effective in combination with mycophenolate and corticosteroids. but long-term evaluations and head-to-head comparisons are lacking. lupus nephritis (LN) is a first-line treatment option.
Impact of Diabetes Mellitus on Heart Failure Patients: Insights from a Comprehensive Analysis and Machine Learning Model Using the Jordanian Heart Failure Registry.,"Heart failure (HF) is a common final pathway of various insults to the heart, primarily from risk factors including diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2. This study analyzed the clinical characteristics of HF in a Jordanian population with a particular emphasis on the relationship between DM and HF. This prospective study used the Jordanian Heart Failure Registry (JoHFR) data. Patients with HF were characterized by DM status and HF type: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Demographics, clinical presentations, and treatment outcomes were collected. Statistical analyses and machine learning techniques were carried out for the prediction of mortality among HF patients: Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique with Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEENN) were employed. A total of 2007 patients with HF were included. Notable differences between diabetic and non-diabetic patients are apparent. Diabetic patients were predominantly male, older, and obese (p < 0.001 for all). A higher incidence of HFpEF was observed in the diabetes cohort (p = 0.006). Also, diabetic patients had significantly higher levels of cholesterol (p = 0.008) and LDL (p = 0.003), reduced hemoglobin levels (p < 0.001), and more severe renal impairment (eGFR; p = 0.006). Machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest Classifier, highlighted its superiority in mortality prediction, with an accuracy of 90.02% and AUC of 80.51%. Predictors of mortality included creatinine levels >115 µmol/L, length of hospital stay, and need for mechanical ventilation. This study underscores notable differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes between diabetic and non-diabetic heart failure patients in Jordan. Diabetic patients had higher prevalence of HFpEF and poorer health indicators such as elevated cholesterol, LDL, and impaired kidney function. High creatinine levels, longer hospital stays, and the need for mechanical ventilation were key predictors of mortality.",['Izraiq M; Almousa E; Hammoudeh S; Sudqi M; Ahmed YB; Abu-Dhaim OA; Mughrabi Sabbagh AL; Khraim KI; Toubasi AA; Al-Kasasbeh A; Rawashdeh S; Abu-Hantash H'],2024,HF is a common final pathway of various insults to the heart.

Cold-associated laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia syndrome after oxaliplatin treatment.,"Oxaliplatin is a platinum-group chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. In addition to hematological and gastrointestinal side effects, laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia associated with cold is reported as a rare side effect. In this article, seven cases with pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia were presented and the diagnosis and treatment planning were reviewed in the light of literature findings. Patient records of cancer patients with laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia were retrospectively analyzed between 2020 and 2023. Demographic characteristics, presenting complaints, vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory tests of the patients diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia were recorded. Seven patients who had gastrointestinal malignancy and oxaliplatin chemotherapy were diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia. The symptoms most commonly developed due to cold weather. The symptoms of three patients had developed while receiving treatment, while four patients were admitted to emergency service after oxaliplatin infusion. The physical examinations revealed no pathological findings of the allergic reaction at presentation or during follow-up skin. Patients were monitored and nasal oxygen therapy was administered. A 5 mg intravenous infusion was given for anxiety symptoms in three patients. Patients were discharged after 4 hours of follow-up with resolution of all symptoms. Laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia should be kept in mind in patients treated with oxaliplatin and presenting with shortness of breath and a feeling of suffocation after cold exposure.",['Babacan A'],2024,seven cases of laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia were presented. seven patients with laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia were diagnosed. symptoms most commonly developed due to cold weather.
Is the incidence rate of colorectal cancer increasing in Mozambique?,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, ranking as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. However, in Africa, CRC is the fifth most common invasive malignancy. Limited data hinder our understanding of the evolving burden of CRC in sub-Saharan Africa. This study explores CRC trends in Mozambique, utilising data from population-based oncological registries. CRC data were gathered from Beira and Maputo population-based cancer registries, along with supplementary information from pathology-based and hospital-based registries. Comparative analyses were performed across different time periods, focusing on trends and epidemiological characteristics. Incidence rates of CRC in Maputo and Beira were relatively low historically. However, data from recent years showed an increase, especially in age groups above 50. Analyses from pathology-based and hospital-based registries affirmed the rising trend. The age-standardised incidence rate in Maputo (2015-2017) was 3.17 for males and 2.55 for females. Beira exhibited increasing rates between 2009 and 2020, particularly in individuals aged 50 and above. The study reveals an emerging burden of CRC in Mozambique, challenging the perception of low incidence. The rising trend underscores the necessity for tailored interventions, emphasizing early diagnosis, preventive strategies, and investments in healthcare infrastructure to address the increasing CRC burden in the region.",['Selemane C; Ferro J; Lorenzoni C; Carrilho C; Ismail MR; Parkin M; Santos LL'],2024,study explores CRC trends in mozambique. data were gathered from population-based cancer registries. incidence rates of CRC in maputo and Beira were relatively low historically.
Relationship between Serum Concentrations and Muscular Expressions of Selenoproteins on Selenium-Supplemented Insulin Resistance Mouse Model.,"Previously, insulin resistance and hepatic oxidative stress with increased expressions of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 1 and selenoprotein P (SelP) were induced in NSY mice, a diabetic mouse model, by administrating a high fat diet (HFD) and seleno-L-methionine (SeMet) for 12 weeks. In this study we developed an analysis method for serum selenoproteins using LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and investigated the effects of supplementary selenium on serum concentrations of selenoproteins as well as protein expression in skeletal muscle as a major insulin target tissue under the same experimental condition. The glucose area under the curves for oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests indicated that the HFD induced insulin resistance, whereas the treatment of SeMet + HFD showed insignificant promotion compared with the HFD-induced insulin resistance. Although the expressions of GPx1 in gastrocnemius and soleus were not significantly induced by supplementary SeMet nor HFD administration, the expressions of SelP in both skeletal muscles were significantly induced by the treatment of SeMet + HFD. There were also significant increases in serum concentrations of SelP by supplementary SeMet + HFD administration, whereas GPx3 was augmented by supplementary SeMet only. These results indicated that the HFD intake under the sufficient selenium status augmented the blood secretion of SelP, which may participate in the reduction of insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles as well as liver or adipose tissues, and it is a better indicator of deterioration than GPx3 as it is a major selenoprotein in serum.",['Ogino H; Murano K; Okuno T; Ueno H'],2024,NSY mice were induced by supplementary selenium administration. supplementary selenium induced insulin resistance and hepatic oxidative stress.

Cigarette smoke sustains immunosuppressive microenvironment inducing M2 macrophage polarization and viability in lung cancer settings.,"It is amply demonstrated that cigarette smoke (CS) has a high impact on lung tumor progression worsening lung cancer patient prognosis and response to therapies. Alteration of immune cell types and functions in smokers' lungs have been strictly related with smoke detrimental effects. However, the role of CS in dictating an inflammatory or immunosuppressive lung microenvironment still needs to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of in vitro exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) focusing on macrophages. Immortalized murine macrophages RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the presence of CS extract and their polarization has been assessed by Real-time PCR and cytofluorimetric analysis, viability has been assessed by SRB assay and 3D-cultures and activation by exposure to Poly(I:C). Moreover, interaction with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC1) murine cell models in the presence of CS extract were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Obtained results indicate that CS induces macrophages polarization towards the M2 phenotype and M2-phenotype macrophages are resistant to the CS toxic activity. Moreover, CS impairs TLR3-mediated M2-M1 phenotype shift thus contributing to the M2 enrichment in lung smokers. These findings indicate that, in lung cancer microenvironment of smokers, CS can contribute to the M2-phenotype macrophages prevalence by different mechanisms, ultimately, driving an anti-inflammatory, likely immunosuppressive, microenvironment in lung cancer smokers.",['Bianchi F; Le Noci V; Bernardo G; Gagliano N; Colombo G; Sommariva M; Palazzo M; Dalle-Donne I; Milzani A; Pupa S; Tagliabue E; Sfondrini L'],2024,cigarette smoke extract (CS) has a high impact on lung tumor progression worsening lung cancer patient prognosis.

Changes in the type 2 diabetes gut mycobiome associate with metformin treatment across populations.,"The human gut teems with a diverse ecosystem of microbes, yet non-bacterial portions of that community are overlooked in studies of metabolic diseases firmly linked to gut bacteria. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with compositional shifts in the gut bacterial microbiome and the mycobiome, the fungal portion of the microbiome. However, whether T2D and/or metformin treatment underpins fungal community changes is unresolved. To differentiate these effects, we curated a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries and validated our findings in a murine experimental model. We use Bayesian multinomial logistic normal models to show that T2D and metformin both associate with shifts in the relative abundance of distinct gut fungi. T2D is associated with shifts in the Saccharomycetes and Sordariomycetes fungal classes, while the genera <i>Fusarium</i> and <i>Tetrapisipora</i> most consistently associate with metformin treatment. We confirmed the impact of metformin on individual gut fungi by administering metformin to healthy mice. Thus, metformin and T2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations. This work highlights for the first time that metformin can confound associations of gut fungi with T2D and warrants the need to consider pharmaceutical interventions in investigations of linkages between metabolic diseases and gut microbial inhabitants. This is the largest to-date multi-country cohort characterizing the human gut mycobiome, and the first to investigate potential perturbations in gut fungi from oral pharmaceutical treatment. We demonstrate the reproducible effects of metformin treatment on the human and murine gut mycobiome and highlight a need to consider metformin as a confounding factor in investigations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the gut microbial ecosystem.",['Van Syoc E; Nixon MP; Silverman JD; Luo Y; Gonzalez FJ; Elbere I; Klovins J; Patterson AD; Rogers CJ; Ganda E'],2024,"a gut mycobiome cohort spanning 1,000 human samples across five countries. metformin and t2D account for subtle, but significant and distinct variation in the gut mycobiome across human populations."
Vitamin D and cancer.,"The role of vitamin D in the prevention of chronic diseases including cancer, has received a great deal of attention during the past few decades. The term ""Cancer"" represents multiple disease states with varying biological complexities. The strongest link between vitamin D and cancer is provided by ecological and studies like observational, in preclinical models. It is apparent that vitamin D exerts diverse biological responses in a tissue specific manner. Moreover, several human factors could affect bioactivity of vitamin D. The mechanism(s) underlying vitamin D initiated anti-carcinogenic effects are diverse and includes changes at the muti-system levels. The oncogenic environment could easily corrupt the traditional role of vitamin D or could ensure resistance to vitamin D mediated responses. Several researchers have identified gaps in our knowledge pertaining to the role of vitamin D in cancer. Further areas are identified to solidify the role of vitamin D in cancer control strategies.",['Bird RP'],2024,vitamin D exerts diverse biological responses in a tissue specific manner. vitamin D exerts diverse biological responses in a tissue specific manner.
Effects of PCSK9 on thrombosis and haemostasis in a variety of metabolic states: Lipids and beyond (Review).,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are widely recognised as being able to induce a potent reduction in low‑density lipoprotein‑cholesterol. An increasing number of studies have suggested that PCSK9 also influences the haemostatic system by altering platelet function and the coagulation cascade. These findings have significant implications for anti‑PCSK9 therapy in patients with specific coagulation conditions, including expanded indications, dose adjustments and drug interactions. The present review summarises the changes in PCSK9 levels in individuals with liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer and other disease states, and discusses their impact on thrombosis and haemostasis. Furthermore, the structure, effects and regulatory mechanisms of PCSK9 on platelets, coagulation factors, inflammatory cells and endothelial cells during coagulation and haemostasis are described.",['Chong S; Mu G; Cen X; Xiang Q; Cui Y'],2024,"an increasing number of studies have suggested that PCSK9 also influences the haemostatic system by altering platelet function and the coagulation cascade. this review summarises the changes in PCSK9 levels in individuals with liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer and other disease states."
Preferred sources of information on diabetes prevention programmes: a population-based cross-sectional study in Poland.,"This study aimed to analyse preferred sources of information on diabetes prevention programmes and to identify sociodemographic determinants influencing these preferences among adults in Poland. A cross-sectional survey was carried out between 15 and 18 September 2023 using a computer-assisted web interview. A self-prepared questionnaire included 10 questions on sources of information on type 2 diabetes prevention. Data were obtained from 1046 adults (18-82 years); 53.4% were females. Most respondents preferred email communication (46.4%), followed by a doctor or nurse (33.5%), and a letter or leaflet directly delivered to the mailbox (25.8%) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) prevention information. Younger respondents were more likely to indicate mass media (OR=1.81, 95% CI=1.12 to 2.95, p=0.01) and digital media (OR=1.65, 95% CI=1.02 to 2.67, p=0.04) as a source of information on DM2 prevention. Those who had higher education (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.96, p=0.002), as well as those with chronic diseases (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.14 to 1.97, p=0.004), were more likely to indicate digital media. Out of 10 different variables analysed in this study, passive occupational status (OR=1.43, 95% CI=1.04 to 1.96, p=0.03) as well as having chronic diseases (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.16 to 1.96, p=0.002) were associated with higher odds of indicating healthcare workers as a preferred source of information. Marital status, having children, place of residence, household characteristics and financial status do not significantly decide communication preferences. Communication on DM2 prevention should be adjusted to public preferences and expectations. Tailoring interventions to different demographic groups can enhance outreach and engagement.

"Efficacy and Safety of Sirolimus-Eluting Stent with Biodegradable Polymer Ultimaster™ in Unselected Korean Population: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study From Korean Multicenter Ultimaster Registry.","Ultimaster™, a third-generation sirolimus-eluting stent using biodegradable polymer, has been introduced to overcome long term adverse vascular events, such as restenosis or stent thrombosis. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the 12-month clinical outcomes of Ultimaster™ stents in Korean patients with coronary artery disease. This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational registry across 12 hospitals. To reflect real-world clinical evidence, non-selective subtypes of patients and lesions were included in this study. The study end point was target lesion failure (TLF) (the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction [MI], and target lesion revascularization [TLR]) at 12-month clinical follow up. A total of 576 patients were enrolled between November 2016 and May 2021. Most of the patients were male (76.5%), with a mean age of 66.0±11.2 years. Among the included patients, 40.1% had diabetes mellitus (DM) and 67.9% had acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At 12 months, the incidence of TLF was 4.1%. The incidence of cardiac death was 1.5%, MI was 1.0%, TLR was 2.7%, and stent thrombosis was 0.6%. In subgroup analysis based on the presence of ACS, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or bifurcation, there were no major differences in the incidence of the primary endpoint. The present registry shows that Ultimaster™ stent is safe and effective for routine real-world clinical practice in non-selective Korean patients, having a low rate of adverse events at least up to 12 months.",['Park S; Rha SW; Choi BG; Seo JB; Choi IJ; Woo SI; Kim SH; Ahn TH; Kim JS; Her AY; Ahn JH; Lee HC; Choi J; Byon JS; Sinurat MR; Choi SY; Cha J; Hyun SJ; Choi CU; Park CG'],2024,"stents were introduced to overcome long term adverse vascular events. the study was a multicenter, prospective, observational registry across 12 hospitals. the study end point was target lesion failure (TLF) at 12-month clinical follow up."
Personalized prediction of diabetic foot ulcer recurrence in elderly individuals using machine learning paradigms.,"This study utilizes machine learning to analyze the recurrence risk of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in elderly diabetic patients, aiming to enhance prevention and intervention efforts. The goal is to construct accurate predictive models for assessing the recurrence risk of DFUs based on high-risk factors, such as age, blood sugar control, alcohol consumption, and smoking, in elderly diabetic patients. Data from 138 elderly diabetic patients were collected, and after data cleaning, outlier screening, and feature integration, machine learning models were constructed. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed, achieving an accuracy rate of 93%. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SVM in predicting the recurrence risk of DFUs in elderly diabetic patients, providing clinicians with a more accurate tool for assessment. The study highlights the significance of machine learning in managing foot ulcers in elderly diabetic patients, particularly in predicting recurrence risk. This approach facilitates timely intervention, reducing the likelihood of patient recurrence, and introduces computer-assisted medical strategies in elderly diabetes management.",['Hong S; Chen Y; Lin Y; Xie X; Chen G; Xie H; Lu W'],2024,this study uses machine learning to analyze the recurrence risk of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in elderly diabetic patients. the aim is to construct accurate predictive models for assessing the recurrence risk of DFUs based on high-risk factors.
On the role of native contact cooperativity in protein folding.,"The consistency of energy landscape theory predictions with available experimental data, as well as direct evidence from molecular simulations, have shown that protein folding mechanisms are largely determined by the contacts present in the native structure. As expected, native contacts are generally energetically favorable. However, there are usually at least as many energetically favorable nonnative pairs owing to the greater number of possible nonnative interactions. This apparent frustration must therefore be reduced by the greater cooperativity of native interactions. In this work, we analyze the statistics of contacts in the unbiased all-atom folding trajectories obtained by Shaw and coworkers, focusing on the unfolded state. By computing mutual cooperativities between contacts formed in the unfolded state, we show that native contacts form the most cooperative pairs, while cooperativities among nonnative or between native and nonnative contacts are typically much less favorable or even anticooperative. Furthermore, we show that the largest network of cooperative interactions observed in the unfolded state consists mainly of native contacts, suggesting that this set of mutually reinforcing interactions has evolved to stabilize the native state.",['Wang D; Frechette LB; Best RB'],2024,"native contacts are generally energetically favorable, but there are usually at least as many energetically favorable nonnative pairs. this frustration must therefore be reduced by greater cooperativity of native interactions."
Hypoparathyroidism update.,"Since the release of the 2022 Second International Workshop Evaluation and Management of Hypoparathyroidism Summary Statement and Guidelines, updates and advances are now available in the cause, complications, and treatment of adult chronic hypoparathyroidism (hypoPTH). This review aims to highlight these new findings and implications to patient care. Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism remains the most common cause, immune-related hypoparathyroidism from checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging autoimmune cause. In a large retrospective cohort study of thyroidectomies, incident fracture was lower, particularly in the vertebra, in the hypoPTH cohort, compared with postthyroidectomy control group. Hypercalciuria increases risk for renal calculi in hypoPTH independent of disease duration and treatment dose. Quality of life is impaired in hypoPTH patients on conventional therapy, improvement was noted post-PTH replacement. TranCon PTH phase 3 RCT reported eucalcemia with reduced renal calcium excretion, normalization of bone turn-over markers, stable BMD and improved quality of life. HypoPTH is a chronic disease associated with significant morbidity and poor Quality of Life. Awareness of treatment targets and follow-up investigations can alleviate patient anxiety regarding over-treatment and under-treatment. Progress in long-acting PTH replacement strategies might provide accessible, feasible alternatives to conventional therapy in brittle hypoPTH patients.",['Chiang C'],2024,postsurgical hypoparathyroidism remains the most common cause. postthyroidism is an emerging autoimmune cause. improvement was noted post-PTH replacement.
Safety of Empagliflozin: An Individual Participant-Level Data Meta-Analysis from Four Large Trials.,"Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve glycemic control, reduce risk of cardiovascular death in patients with T2D, and treat patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The safety profile of empagliflozin is well documented, although adverse events (AEs) remain of interest to clinicians. This study provides an up-to-date safety evaluation of empagliflozin. Data were pooled from four long-term trials which included: patients with T2D and established cardiovascular disease (EMPA-REG OUTCOME), patients with HF, with/without diabetes (EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved), and patients with CKD, with/without diabetes (EMPA-KIDNEY). Since three of the four trials evaluated empagliflozin 10 mg, the meta-analysis was restricted to this dose. Total trial medication exposure was 19,727 patient-years for patients who received empagliflozin (n = 10,472) and 19,447 patient-years for placebo (n = 10,461). The percentages of patients with serious AEs, fatal AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar for both groups. The incidences of serious urinary tract infection and serious pyelonephritis or urosepsis were similar for both groups but higher for women taking empagliflozin versus placebo. Serious genital infections were not increased with empagliflozin versus placebo. There was a slight increase in ketoacidosis and serious volume depletion in patients who received empagliflozin versus placebo. The occurrence of serious acute kidney injury was lower with empagliflozin versus placebo. Empagliflozin was not associated with an increased incidence of severe hypoglycemia, bone fractures, or lower limb amputations. Empagliflozin is therefore considered safe in people without diabetes, the elderly, patients with very low estimated glomerular filtration rate, low body mass index, and HF. Safety is unaltered by blood pressure, concomitant medication for hypertension, HF, and immunosuppression. This meta-analysis of long-term safety data extends current knowledge and confirms the safety and tolerability of empagliflozin.",['Wanner C; Iliev H; Duarte N; Schueler E; Soares AR; Thanam V; Pfarr E'],2024,"empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) the safety profile of empagliflozin is well documented, although adverse events remain of interest to clinicians."
Electrolyte disturbances in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection: An observational study.,"There are multiple mechanisms by which The Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection can cause electrolyte abnormalities, which may not be the case for bacterial causes of pneumonia. This study aimed to assess the differences in electrolyte levels between patients suffering from COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. This is an original, retrospective study. Two cohorts of hospitalized patients were included, 1 suffering from COVID-19 and the other from bacterial pneumonia. Their day 1 and day 3 levels of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, as well as their outcomes, were extracted from the charts. Statistical analysis was subsequently performed. Mean admission levels of sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium were 135.64 ± 6.13, 4.38 ± 0.69, 3.53 ± 0.69, and 2.03 ± 0.51, respectively. The mean day 3 levels of these electrolytes were 138.3 ± 5.06, 4.18 ± 0.59, 3.578 ± 0.59, and 2.11 ± 0.64, respectively. Patients suffering from bacterial pneumonia were significantly older (N = 219, mean = 64.88 ± 15.99) than patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (N = 240, mean = 57.63 ± 17.87). Bacterial pneumonia group had significantly higher serum potassium (N = 211, mean = 4.51 ± 0.76), and magnesium (N = 115, mean = 2.12 ± 0.60) levels compared to COVID-19 group (N = 227, mean = 4.254 ± 0.60 for potassium and N = 118, mean = 1.933 ± 0.38 for magnesium). Only magnesium was significantly higher among day 3 electrolytes in the bacterial pneumonia group. No significant association between electrolyte levels and outcomes was seen. We found that COVID-19 patients had lower potassium and magnesium levels on admission, possibly due to the effect of COVID-19 on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system as well as patient characteristics and management. We did not find enough evidence to recommend using electrolyte levels as a determinator of prognosis, but more research is needed.",['Cancarevic I; Nassar M; Foster A; Umar Z; Parikh A; Ahammed MR; Shaban L; Abosheaishaa H; Mergen D; Amin T; Ozkan BI; Sánchez Ruiz AM; Hosna A; Ul Rasool MH; Ahmed N; Ayotunde F; Ashfaq S; Lopez R; Rizzo V'],2024,"two cohorts of hospitalized patients were included, 1 suffering from COVID-19 and the other from bacterial pneumonia. their day 1 and day 3 levels of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus were extracted from the charts."
Evaluating the OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo's performance in extracting information from scientific articles on diabetic retinopathy.,"We aimed to compare the concordance of information extracted and the time taken between a large language model (OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo via API) against conventional human extraction methods in retrieving information from scientific articles on diabetic retinopathy (DR). The extraction was done using GPT3.5 Turbo as of October 2023. OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo significantly reduced the time taken for extraction. Concordance was highest at 100% for the extraction of the country of study, 64.7% for significant risk factors of DR, 47.1% for exclusion and inclusion criteria, and lastly 41.2% for odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The concordance levels seemed to indicate the complexity associated with each prompt. This suggests that OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo may be adopted to extract simple information that is easily located in the text, leaving more complex information to be extracted by the researcher. It is crucial to note that the foundation model is constantly improving significantly with new versions being released quickly. Subsequent work can focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), embedding, chunking PDF into useful sections, and prompting to improve the accuracy of extraction.",['Gue CCY; Rahim NDA; Rojas-Carabali W; Agrawal R; Rk P; Abisheganaden J; Yip WF'],2024,the extraction was done using GPT3.5 Turbo as of October 2023. the concordance was highest at 100% for the extraction of the country of study.
Leveraging a rationally designed veliparib-based anilide eliciting anti-leukemic effects for the design of pH-responsive polymer nanoformulation.,"Careful recruitment of the components of the HDAC inhibitory template culminated in veliparib-based anilide 8 that elicited remarkable cell growth inhibitory effects against HL-60 cell lines mediated via dual modulation of PARP [(IC<sub>50</sub> (PARP1) = 0.02 nM) and IC<sub>50</sub> (PARP2) = 1 nM)] and HDACs (IC<sub>50</sub> value = 0.05, 0.147 and 0.393 μM (HDAC1, 2 and 3). Compound 8 downregulated the expression levels of signatory biomarkers of PARP and HDAC inhibition. Also, compound 8 arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and induced autophagy. Polymer nanoformulation (mPEG-PCl copolymeric micelles loaded with compound 8) was prepared by the nanoprecipitation technique. The mPEG-PCL diblock copolymer was prepared by ring-opening polymerization method using stannous octoate as a catalyst. The morphology of the compound 8@mPEG-PCL was examined using TEM and the substance was determined to be monodispersed, spherical in form, and had an average diameter of 138 nm. The polymer nanoformulation manifested pH-sensitive behaviour as a greater release of compound 8 was observed at 6.2 pH as compared to 7.4 pH mimicking physiological settings. The aforementioned findings indicate that the acidic pH of the tumour microenvironment might stimulate the nanomedicine release which in turn can attenuate the off-target effects precedentially claimed to be associated with HDAC inhibitors.",['Thakur A; Chu YH; Rao NV; Mathew J; Grewal AS; Prabakaran P; Guru S; Liou JP; Pan CH; Nepali K'],2024,compound 8 downregulated expression levels of signatory biomarkers of PARP and HDAC inhibition. compound 8 arrested cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and induced autophagy.
FLT3-ITD regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum functions in acute myeloid leukemia.,"The FLT3-ITD mutation represents the most frequent genetic alteration in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient and is associated with poor prognosis. Mutation result in the retention of a constitutively active form of this receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the subsequent modification of its downstream effectors. Here, we assessed the impact of such retention on ER homeostasis and found that mutant cells present lower levels of ER stress due to the overexpression of ERO1α, one of the main proteins of the protein folding machinery at the ER. Overexpression of ERO1α resulted essential for ITD mutant cells survival and chemoresistance and also played a crucial role in shaping the type of glucose metabolism in AML cells, being the mitochondrial pathway the predominant one in those with a higher ER stress (non-mutated cells) and the glycolytic pathway the predominant one in those with lower ER stress (mutated cells). Our data indicate that FLT3 mutational status dictates the route for glucose metabolism in an ERO1α depending on manner and this provides a survival advantage to tumors carrying these ITD mutations.",['Turos-Cabal M; Sánchez-Sánchez AM; Puente-Moncada N; Herrera F; Antolin I; Rodríguez C; Martín V'],2024,"the FLT3-ITD mutation represents the most frequent genetic alteration in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient. mutation result in the retention of a constitutively active form of this receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subsequent modification of its downstream effectors. mutant cells present lower levels of ER stress due to the overexpression of ERO1, one of the main proteins of the protein folding machinery at the ER."
Cause-Specific Excess Mortality During the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021) in 12 Countries of the C-MOR Consortium.,"This study investigated cause-specific mortality rates in 12 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. We collected weekly cause-specific mortality data from respiratory disease, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer from national vital statistic databases. We calculated excess mortality for respiratory disease (excluding COVID-19 codes), pneumonia, and CVD in 2020 and 2021 by comparing observed weekly against expected mortality based on historical data (2015-2019), accounting for seasonal trends. We used multilevel regression models to investigate the association between country-level pandemic-related variables and cause-specific mortality. Significant reductions in cumulative mortality from respiratory disease and pneumonia were observed in 2020 and/or 2021, except for Georgia, Northern Ireland, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, which exhibited excess mortality for one or both causes. Australia, Austria, Cyprus, Georgia, and Northern Ireland experienced excess cumulative CVD mortality in 2020 and/or 2021. Australia, Austria, Brazil, Cyprus, Georgia, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Slovenia, experienced increased crude cumulative cancer mortality during 2020 and/or 2021 compared to previous years. Among pandemic-related variables, reported COVID-19 incidence was negatively associated with increased cancer mortality, excess respiratory, (2020) and pneumonia (2021) mortality, and positively associated with respiratory and CVD mortality (2021). Stringency of control measures were negatively associated with excess respiratory disease, CVD, and increased cancer mortality (2021). This study provides evidence of substantial excess mortality from CVD, and notable reductions in respiratory disease and pneumonia in both years across most countries investigated. Our study also highlights the beneficial impact of stringent control measures in mitigating excess mortality from most causes in 2021.",['Beeks VV; Achilleos S; Quattrocchi A; Pallari CT; Critselis E; Salameh P; Rahmanian Haghighi MR; Rodriguez-Llanes JM; Ambrosio G; Artemiou A; Gabel J; Bennett CM; Cuthbertson J; Zimmermann C; Schernhammer ES; Costa AJL; de Carvalho LF; Lobato JCP; Athanasiadou M; Critchley JA; Goldsmith LP; Kandelaki L; Glushkova N; Davletov K; Semenova Y; Erzen I; Verstiuk O; Alekkou D; Polemitis A; Charalambous A; Demetriou CA'],2024,"study collected weekly cause-specific mortality data from respiratory disease, pneumonia, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. we calculated excess mortality for respiratory disease (excluding COVID-19 codes), pneumonia, and CVD in 2020 and 2021."
Cancer cachexia: A scoping review on non-pharmacological interventions.,"Cancer cachexia occurs in 30%-80% of patients, increasing morbidity and mortality and impacting the health-related quality of life also for caregivers. Pharmacological interventions have been studied but have shown inconsistent effects on patients' lives in terms of relative outcomes and poor adherence to pharmacological treatment. We provide an overview of the evidence on non-pharmacological interventions for cancer cachexia. We conducted a scoping review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR). On September 21, 2022, plus an update on January 10, 2024, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and Scopus for 2012-2024. We excluded pharmacological interventions defined as ""any substance, inorganic or organic, natural or synthetic, that can produce functional modifications, through a chemical, physicochemical or physical action."" The search retrieved 9308 articles, of which 17 were eligible. Non-pharmacological interventions included nutritional counseling, complementary therapies (acupuncture), rehabilitation, and psychoeducational/psychosocial support. The data showed small and heterogeneous samples and different disease localization and stages. Thirty-nine percent were multimodal interventions and aimed at patients, not families. The common primary outcomes were body weight and composition, biomarkers, quality of life, psychological suffering, and muscular strength. Only three studies focus on the patient-caregiver dyad. Interventions on cancer cachexia should be multimodal and multiprofessional, proposed early, and aimed at quality of life outcomes. The caregiver's involvement is essential. Nurses can play an active role in managing cancer cachexia. More well-designed studies are needed to understand the efficacy and contents of non-pharmacological interventions.

Drug-Coated Balloons in the Management of Coronary Artery Disease.,"Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are specialized coronary devices comprised of a semicompliant balloon catheter with an engineered coating that allows the delivery of antiproliferative agents locally to the vessel wall during percutaneous coronary intervention. Although DCBs were initially developed more than a decade ago, their potential in coronary interventions has recently sparked renewed interest, especially in the United States. Originally designed to overcome the limitations of conventional balloon angioplasty and stenting, they aim to match or even improve upon the outcomes of drug-eluting stents without leaving a permanent implant. Presently, in-stent restenosis is the condition with the most robust evidence supporting the use of DCBs. DCBs provide improved long-term vessel patency compared with conventional balloon angioplasty and may be comparable to drug-eluting stents without the need for an additional stent layer, supporting their use as a first-line therapy for in-stent restenosis. Beyond the treatment of in-stent restenosis, DCBs provide an additional tool for de novo lesions for a strategy that avoids a permanent metal scaffold, which may be especially useful for the management of technically challenging anatomies such as small vessels and bifurcations. DCBs might also be advantageous for patients with high bleeding risk due to the decreased necessity for extended antiplatelet therapy, and in patients with diabetes and patients with diffuse disease to minimize long-stented segments. Further studies are crucial to confirm these broader applications for DCBs and to further validate safety and efficacy.",['Korjian S; McCarthy KJ; Larnard EA; Cutlip DE; McEntegart MB; Kirtane AJ; Yeh RW'],2024,drug-coated balloons are specialized coronary devices. they are a semicompliant balloon catheter with an engineered coating. they aim to match or even improve upon the outcomes of drug-eluting stents without leaving a permanent implant.
Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure outcomes and cardiovascular death across the cardiometabolic disease spectrum: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. Individual trials were powered to study composite outcomes in one disease state. We aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on specific clinical endpoints across multiple demographic and disease subgroups. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we queried online databases (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SCOPUS) up to Feb 10, 2024, for primary and secondary analyses of large trials (n>1000) of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including acute myocardial infarction). Outcomes studied included composite of first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death, first hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death, total (first and recurrent) hospitalisation for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024513836. We included 15 trials (N=100 952). Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of first hospitalisation for heart failure by 29% in patients with heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·67-0·77]), 28% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·72 [0·67-0·77]), 32% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·68 [0·61-0·77]), and 28% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·72 [0·66-0·79]). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced cardiovascular death by 14% in patients with heart failure (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·79-0·93]), 15% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·85 [0·79-0·91]), 11% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·89 [0·82-0·96]), and 13% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·87 [0·78-0·97]). The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on both first hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiovascular death was consistent across the majority of the 51 subgroups studied. Notable exceptions included acute myocardial infarction (22% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (26% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced heart failure events and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These effects were consistent across a wide range of subgroups within these populations. This supports the eligibility of a large population with cardiorenal-metabolic diseases for treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.

The landscape of etiological patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand.,"Thailand is among countries with the highest global incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). While viral hepatitis and liver fluke infections have been associated with HCC and iCCA, respectively, other environmental risk factors, overall risk factor commonality and combinatorial roles, and effects on survival have not been systematically examined. We conducted a TIGER-LC consortium-based population study covering all high-incidence areas of both malignancies across Thailand: 837 HCC, 1474 iCCA, and 1112 controls (2011-2019) were comprehensively queried on lifelong environmental exposures, lifestyle, and medical history. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to evaluate risk factors and associated survival patterns. Our models identified shared risk factors between HCC and iCCA, such as viral hepatitis infection, liver fluke infection, and diabetes, including novel and shared associations of agricultural pesticide exposure (OR range of 1.50; 95% CI: 1.06-2.11 to 2.91; 95% CI: 1.82-4.63) along with vulnerable sources of drinking water. Most patients had multiple risk factors, magnifying their risk considerably. Patients with lower risk levels had better survival in both HCC (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64-0.96) and iCCA (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.70-0.99). Risk factor co-exposures and their common associations with HCC and iCCA in Thailand emphasize the importance for future prevention and control measures, especially in its large agricultural sector. The observed mortality patterns suggest ways to stratify patients for anticipated survivorship and develop plans to support medical care of longer-term survivors, including behavioral changes to reduce exposures.",['Pupacdi B; Loffredo CA; Budhu A; Rabibhadana S; Bhudhisawasdi V; Pairojkul C; Sukeepaisarnjaroen W; Pugkhem A; Luvira V; Lertprasertsuke N; Chotirosniramit A; Auewarakul CU; Ungtrakul T; Sricharunrat T; Sangrajrang S; Phornphutkul K; Albert PS; Kim S; Harris CC; Mahidol C; Wang XW; Ruchirawat M'],2024,"Thailand is among countries with highest global incidence and mortality rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) other environmental risk factors, overall risk factor commonality and combinatorial roles, and effects on survival have not been systematically examined."
"Attitudes, Beliefs, and Intention to Receive a COVID-19 Vaccine for Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Disease.","Sickle cell disease (SCD), which occurs primarily in individuals of African descent, has been identified as a preexisting health condition for COVID-19 with higher rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admissions, and death. National data indicate Black individuals have higher rates of vaccine hesitancy and lower COVID-19 vaccination rates. Understanding the key predictors of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine is essential as intention is strongly associated with vaccination behavior. This multisite study examined attitudes, beliefs, intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines, and educational preferences among adolescents, young adults, and caregivers of children living with SCD. Participants completed an online survey between July 2021 and March 2022. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between participant age and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, beliefs, and vaccine intentions. Of the 200 participants, 65.1% of adolescents, 62.5% of young adults, and 48.4% of caregivers intended to receive a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child. Perception that the vaccine was safe was statistically significant and associated with patient and caregiver intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their child. Participant age was also statistically significant and associated with the intent to get a booster for patients. Study findings highlight key concerns and influencers identified by patients with SCD and their caregivers that are essential for framing COVID-19 vaccine education during clinical encounters. Study results can also inform the design of messaging campaigns for the broader pediatric SCD population and targeted interventions for SCD subpopulations (eg, adolescents, caregivers).",['Shook LM; Rosen BL; Mara CA; Mosley C; Thompson AA; Smith-Whitley K; Schwartz L; Barriteau C; King A; Oke E; Jallow F; Murphy B; Crosby L'],2024,"study examined attitudes, beliefs, intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. participants completed an online survey between July 2021 and March 2022. participants included 65.1% of adolescents, 62.5% of young adults, and 48.4% of caregivers intended to receive the vaccine for themselves or their child."
Concomitant autoimmunity and risk of multiple sclerosis disability worsening.,"Few studies have examined the effect of concomitant autoimmune diseases on multiple sclerosis (MS) disability worsening. We set out to examine whether concomitant Crohn's Disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC), or Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) affect MS disability worsening in a nationwide cohort of MS patients as defined by reaching expanded disability scale status (EDSS) scores 3.0, 4.0 and 6.0. Patients with MS onset between January 2004 and January 2019 were identified from the Swedish MS registry and the Swedish National Patient Register. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the median time to reach sustained disability milestones. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the risk of reaching disability milestones among persons with and without CD, UC, or T1D. Out of 8972 persons with MS, 88 (1.0 %) had T1D, 47 (0.8 %) had UC, and 78 (0.9 %) had CD. There was a significantly higher risk of disability progression, for persons with MS and T1D for reaching EDSS 6.0, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.21 (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.48 -3.31) and persons with MS and comorbid CD for reaching EDSS 3.0, HR = 2.30 (95 %CI = 1.74-3.04) and 4.0, HR = 1.59 (95 %CI = 1.09-2.32), and persons with MS and comorbid UC for reaching EDSS 3.0 HR = 1.57 (95 %CI = 1.15-2.14). As defined by Charlson's comorbidity index, the co-existence of other co-morbidities conferred a significant increase in the risk of reaching all endpoints, with HR ranging from 1.23 to 1.62. Comorbidity is associated with a significantly increased risk of reaching disability end-points, and T1D, CD, and UC increase the risk further. Thus, there appears to be a need for increased vigilance of comorbidites in persons with MS in order to optimise the long-term outcome of MS.",['Binzer S; Hillert J; Manouchehrinia A'],2024,patients with MS onset between January 2004 and January 2019 identified from the Swedish MS registry and the Swedish National Patient Register. patients with MS onset between January 2004 and January 2019 were identified from the Swedish MS registry and the Swedish national patient register.
Methylation-regulated tumor suppressor gene PDE7B promotes HCC invasion and metastasis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a high mortality rate, and the mechanisms underlying tumor development and progression remain unclear. However, inactivated tumor suppressor genes might play key roles. DNA methylation is a critical regulatory mechanism for inactivating tumor suppressor genes in HCC. Therefore, this study investigated methylation-related tumor suppressors in HCC to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We assessed genome-wide DNA methylation in HCC using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA sequencing, respectively, and identified the differential expression of methylation-related genes, and finally screened phosphodiesterase 7B (PDE7B) for the study. The correlation between PDE7B expression and clinical features was then assessed. We then analyzed the changes of PDE7B expression in HCC cells before and after DNA methyltransferase inhibitor treatment by MassArray nucleic acid mass spectrometry. Furthermore, HCC cell lines overexpressing PDE7B were constructed to investigate its effect on HCC cell function. Finally, GO and KEGG were applied for the enrichment analysis of PDE7B-related pathways, and their effects on the expression of pathway proteins and EMT-related factors in HCC cells were preliminarily explored. HCC exhibited a genome-wide hypomethylation pattern. We screened 713 hypomethylated and 362 hypermethylated mCG regions in HCC and adjacent normal tissues. GO analysis showed that the main molecular functions of hypermethylation and hypomethylation were ""DNA-binding transcriptional activator activity"" and ""structural component of ribosomes"", respectively, whereas KEGG analysis showed that they were enriched in ""bile secretion"" and ""Ras-associated protein-1 (Rap1) signaling pathway"", respectively. PDE7B expression was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues, and this low expression was negatively correlated with recurrence and prognosis of HCC. In addition, DNA methylation regulates PDE7B expression in HCC. On the contrary, overexpression of PDE7B inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis in vitro. In addition, PDE7B-related genes were mainly enriched in the PI3K/ATK signaling pathway, and PDE7B overexpression inhibited the progression of PI3K/ATK signaling pathway-related proteins and EMT. PDE7B expression in HCC may be regulated by promoter methylation. PDE7B can regulate the EMT process in HCC cells through the PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn affects HCC metastasis and invasion.",['Du Y; Xu Y; Guo X; Tan C; Zhu X; Liu G; Lyu X; Bei C'],2024,methylation-related tumor suppressor genes in HCC may play key roles.

Efficacy and Safety of Metformin and Atorvastatin Combination Therapy vs. Monotherapy with Either Drug in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dyslipidemia Patients (ATOMIC): Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial.,"It is well known that a large number of patients with diabetes also have dyslipidemia, which significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination drugs consisting of metformin and atorvastatin, widely used as therapeutic agents for diabetes and dyslipidemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group and phase III multicenter study included adults with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels >7.0% and <10.0%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >100 and <250 mg/dL. One hundred eighty-five eligible subjects were randomized to the combination group (metformin+atorvastatin), metformin group (metformin+atorvastatin placebo), and atorvastatin group (atorvastatin+metformin placebo). The primary efficacy endpoints were the percent changes in HbA1c and LDL-C levels from baseline at the end of the treatment. After 16 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, HbA1c showed a significant difference of 0.94% compared to the atorvastatin group in the combination group (0.35% vs. -0.58%, respectively; P<0.0001), whereas the proportion of patients with increased HbA1c was also 62% and 15%, respectively, showing a significant difference (P<0.001). The combination group also showed a significant decrease in LDL-C levels compared to the metformin group (-55.20% vs. -7.69%, P<0.001) without previously unknown adverse drug events. The addition of atorvastatin to metformin improved HbA1c and LDL-C levels to a significant extent compared to metformin or atorvastatin alone in diabetes and dyslipidemia patients. This study also suggested metformin's preventive effect on the glucose-elevating potential of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, insufficiently controlled with exercise and diet. Metformin and atorvastatin combination might be an effective treatment in reducing the CVD risk in patients with both diabetes and dyslipidemia because of its lowering effect on LDL-C and glucose.",['Lee JE; Yu SH; Kim SR; Ahn KJ; Song KH; Lee IK; Shon HS; Kim IJ; Lim S; Kim DM; Chung CH; Lee WY; Lee SH; Kim DJ; Cho SR; Jung CH; Jeon HJ; Lee SH; Park KY; Rhee SY; Kim SG; Park SO; Kim DJ; Kim BJ; Lee SA; Kim YH; Kim KS; Seo JA; Nam-Goong IS; Lee CW; Kim DK; Kim SW; Cho CG; Kim JH; Kim YJ; Yoo JM; Min KW; Lee MK'],2024,metformin and atorvastatin were widely used as therapeutic agents for diabetes and dyslipidemia. a large number of patients with diabetes also have dyslipidemia.
Expert Panel Recommendations for a Standardized Ambulatory Glucose Profile Report for Connected Insulin Pens.,"Connected insulin pens capture data on insulin dosing/timing and can integrate with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices with essential insulin and glucose metrics into a single platform. Standardization of connected insulin pen reports is desirable to enhance clinical utility with a single report. An international expert panel was convened to develop a standardized connected insulin pen report incorporating insulin and glucose metrics into a single, clinically useful report. An extensive literature review and identification of examples of current connected insulin pen reports was performed serving as the basis for creation of a draft of a standardized connected insulin pen report. The expert panel participated in three virtual standardization meetings and online surveys. The AGP Report: Connected Insulin Pen brings all clinically relevant CGM-derived glucose and connected insulin pen metrics into a single simplified two-page report. The first page contains the time in ranges bar, summary of key insulin and glucose metrics, the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) curve, and detailed basal (long-acting) insulin assessment. The second page contains the bolus (mealtime and correction) insulin assessment periods with information on meal timing, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR), average bolus insulin dose and number of days with bolus doses recorded. The report's second page contains daily glucose profiles with an overlay of the timing and amount of basal and bolus insulin administered.

Dual Starvations Induce Pyroptosis for Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy through Simultaneous Deprivation of Glucose and Glutamine.,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal disease, and existing treatment methods are ineffective, so it is urgent to develop new effective treatment strategies. The high dependence of pancreatic cancer cells on glucose and glutamine suggests that disrupting this dependency could serve as an alternative strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy. We identified the vital genes glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2) through bioinformatics analysis, which regulate glucose and glutamine metabolism in pancreatic cancer, respectively. Human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSA NPs) for delivery of GLUT1 and ASCT2 inhibitors, BAY-876/V-9302@HSA NPs, were prepared by a self-assembly process. This nanodrug inhibits glucose and glutamine uptake of pancreatic cancer cells through the released BAY-876 and V-9302, leading to nutrition deprivation and oxidative stress. The inhibition of glutamine leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of the glutathione, which further aggravates oxidative stress. Both of them lead to a significant increase in reactive oxygen species, activating caspase 1 and GSDMD and finally inducing pyroptosis. This study provides a new effective strategy for orthotopic pancreatic cancer treatment by dual starvation-induced pyroptosis. The study for screening metabolic targets using bioinformatics analysis followed by constructing nanodrugs loaded with inhibitors will inspire future targeted metabolic therapy for pancreatic cancer.",['Wang X; Ding B; Liu W; Qi L; Li J; Zheng X; Song Y; Li Q; Wu J; Zhang M; Chen H; Wang Y; Li Y; Sun B; Ma P'],2024,a new effective strategy for orthotopic pancreatic cancer treatment. the high dependence of pancreatic cancer cells on glucose and glutamine suggests that disrupting this dependency could serve as an alternative strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy.
US practice adoption of patient-engagement strategies and spending for adults with diabetes and cardiovascular disease.,"Patient-engagement strategies are being encouraged by payers and governments, but with limited evidence about whether practice adoption of these strategies impacts utilization and spending. We examine the association of physician practice adoption of patient-engagement strategies (low vs moderate vs high) with potentially preventable utilization and total spending for patients with type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease using US physician practice survey (n = 2086) and Medicare fee-for-service (n = 736 269) data. In adjusted analyses, there were no differences in potentially preventable utilization associated with practice adoption of patient-engagement strategies. Compared with patients attributed to practices with moderate adoption, patients attributed to practices with high adoption had higher total spending ($26 364 vs $25 991; <i>P</i> < .05) driven by spending for long-term services and supports, including home health agency, long-term care, skilled nursing facilities, and hospice payments. In contrast, patients attributed to practices with low adoption had higher total spending ($26 481 vs $25 991; <i>P</i> < .01) driven by spending for tests and acute care and clinical access spending. The results highlight that stakeholders that encourage the use of patient-engagement strategies should not necessarily expect reduced spending.",['Rodriguez HP; Rubio K; Miller-Rosales C; Wood AJ'],2023,"study examines association of physician practice adoption of patient-engagement strategies with potentially preventable utilization and total spending for patients with type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. in adjusted analyses, there were no differences in potentially preventable utilization associated with practice adoption of patient-engagement strategies."
Deletion of IRE1α in podocytes exacerbates diabetic nephropathy in mice.,"Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of podocytes contributes to the pathogenesis of glomerular diseases. Protein misfolding activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a compensatory signaling network. We address the role of the UPR and the UPR transducer, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy in mice. Diabetes caused progressive albuminuria in control mice that was exacerbated in podocyte-specific IRE1α knockout (KO) mice. Compared to diabetic controls, diabetic IRE1α KO mice showed reductions in podocyte number and synaptopodin. Glomerular ultrastructure was altered only in diabetic IRE1α KO mice; the major changes included widening of podocyte foot processes and glomerular basement membrane. Activation of the UPR and autophagy was evident in diabetic control, but not diabetic IRE1α KO mice. Analysis of human glomerular gene expression in the JuCKD-Glom database demonstrated induction of genes associated with the ER, UPR and autophagy in diabetic nephropathy. Thus, mice with podocyte-specific deletion of IRE1α demonstrate more severe diabetic nephropathy and attenuation of the glomerular UPR and autophagy, implying a protective effect of IRE1α. These results are consistent with data in human diabetic nephropathy and highlight the potential for therapeutically targeting these pathways.",['Cybulsky AV; Papillon J; Guillemette J; Navarro-Betancourt JR; Chung CF; Iwawaki T; Fantus IG'],2024,protein misfolding activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). the protein response activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). diabetes caused progressive albuminuria in control mice that was exacerbated in diabetic IRE1 KO mice.
Combining plasma Aβ and p-tau217 improves detection of brain amyloid in non-demented elderly.,"Maximizing the efficiency to screen amyloid-positive individuals in asymptomatic and non-demented aged population using blood-based biomarkers is essential for future success of clinical trials in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we elucidate the utility of combination of plasma amyloid-β (Aβ)-related biomarkers and tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217) to predict abnormal Aβ-positron emission tomography (PET) in the preclinical and prodromal AD. We designed the cross-sectional study including two ethnically distinct cohorts, the Japanese trial-ready cohort for preclinica and prodromal AD (J-TRC) and the Swedish BioFINDER study. J-TRC included 474 non-demented individuals (CDR 0: 331, CDR 0.5: 143). Participants underwent plasma Aβ and p-tau217 assessments, and Aβ-PET imaging. Findings in J-TRC were replicated in the BioFINDER cohort including 177 participants (cognitively unimpaired: 114, mild cognitive impairment: 63). In both cohorts, plasma Aβ(1-42) (Aβ42) and Aβ(1-40) (Aβ40) were measured using immunoprecipitation-MALDI TOF mass spectrometry (Shimadzu), and p-tau217 was measured with an immunoassay on the Meso Scale Discovery platform (Eli Lilly). Aβ-PET was abnormal in 81 participants from J-TRC and 71 participants from BioFINDER. Plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and p-tau217 individually showed moderate to high accuracies when detecting abnormal Aβ-PET scans, which were improved by combining plasma biomarkers and by including age, sex and APOE genotype in the models. In J-TRC, the highest AUCs were observed for the models combining p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio, APOE, age, sex in the whole cohort (AUC = 0.936), combining p-tau217, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, APOE, age, sex in the CDR 0 group (AUC = 0.948), and combining p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio, APOE, age, sex in the CDR 0.5 group (AUC = 0.955), respectively. Each subgroup results were replicated in BioFINDER, where the highest AUCs were seen for models combining p-tau217, Aβ42/40 ratio, APOE, age, sex in cognitively unimpaired (AUC = 0.938), and p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio, APOE, age, sex in mild cognitive impairment (AUC = 0.914). Combination of plasma Aβ-related biomarkers and p-tau217 exhibits high performance when predicting Aβ-PET positivity. Adding basic clinical information (i.e., age, sex, APOE ε genotype) improved the prediction in preclinical AD, but not in prodromal AD. Combination of Aβ-related biomarkers and p-tau217 could be highly useful for pre-screening of participants in clinical trials of preclinical and prodromal AD.",['Niimi Y; Janelidze S; Sato K; Tomita N; Tsukamoto T; Kato T; Yoshiyama K; Kowa H; Iwata A; Ihara R; Suzuki K; Kasuga K; Ikeuchi T; Ishii K; Ito K; Nakamura A; Senda M; Day TA; Burnham SC; Iaccarino L; Pontecorvo MJ; Hansson O; Iwatsubo T'],2024,a study aims to test the effectiveness of plasma amyloid- biomarkers. the study was designed to predict abnormal A-positron emission tomography. participants underwent plasma A and p-tau217 assessments.
Association between sleep patterns and galectin-3 in a Chinese community population.,"Irregular sleep patterns have been associated with inflammation. Galectin-3, a novel biomarker, plays an important role in inflammation. We investigated the relationship between sleep patterns and galectin-3 in a Chinese population. A total of 1,058 participants from the Shenzhen-Hong Kong United Network on Cardiovascular Disease study were included in the analysis. Age and sex-adjusted linear regression models were employed to investigate the relationship between galectin-3 level and traditional metabolic biomarkers. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association among sleep disturbance, nighttime sleep duration, and daytime napping duration and elevated galectin-3, with elevated galectin-3 defined as galectin-3 level > 65.1 ng/ml. Of study participants, the mean age was 45.3 years and 54.3% were women. Waist circumference, natural logarithm (ln)-transformed triglyceride, and ln-transformed high sensitivity C-reactive protein were positively associated with galectin-3 level (age and sex-adjusted standardized β [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.12 [0.04, 0.21], 0.11 [0.05, 0.17], and 0.08 [0.02, 0.14], respectively). Sleep disturbance was associated with elevated galectin-3 (odds ratio [95% CI], 1.68 [1.05, 2.68], compared to those without sleep disturbance) after adjusting for traditional metabolic biomarkers. No interaction was observed between galectin-3 and age, sex, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes on sleep disturbance. No association was found between nighttime sleep duration or daytime napping duration and elevated galectin-3. Our study provides evidence of a significant association between sleep disturbance and elevated galectin-3 level, independent of traditional metabolic biomarkers. Screening and interventions on galectin-3 could assist in preventing sleep disturbance-induced inflammatory disease.",['Liu L; Zhen J; Liu S; Ren L; Zhao G; Liang J; Xu A; Li C; Wu J; Cheung BMY'],2024,"study participants included 1,058 participants from the shenzhen-Hong Kong united network on cardiovascular disease study. logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between sleep disturbance, nighttime sleep duration, and daytime napping duration."
Left and right atrioventricular coupling index in patients with beta-thalassemia major.,"The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship of left atrioventricular coupling index (LACI) and right atrioventricular coupling index (RACI) with demographics, clinical data, cardiovascular magnetic resonance findings, and cardiac complications (heart failure, arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension) in a cohort of patients with beta-thalassemia major (β-TM). We evaluated 292 β-TM patients (151 females, 36.72 ± 11.76 years) consecutively enrolled in the Extension-Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassemia (E-MIOT) project. Moreover, we assessed 32 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (12 females, mean age 40.78 ± 14.35 years). LACI was determined by calculating the ratio of the left atrium end-diastolic volume to the left ventricle end-diastolic volume, while RACI was defined by calculating the ratio of the right atrium end-diastolic volume to the right ventricle end-diastolic volume. Compared to healthy control, β-TM demonstrated increased LACI (22.99 ± 13.58% vs. 16.05 ± 5.28%; p < 0.0001) and RACI (27.84 ± 10.30% vs. 17.06 ± 5.03%; p < 0.0001). Aging, diabetes, splenectomy, and the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) showed a significant positive association with both LACI and RACI. In stepwise regression analysis, the presence of LGE was found to be an independent predictor of both impaired LACI and RACI (β coefficient = 0.244, p < 0.0001 and β coefficient = 0.218, p = 0.003; respectively). LACI and RACI were not correlated with myocardial iron overload. Patients with cardiac complications had significantly higher LACI and RACI than patients without cardiac complications. In patients with β-TM, LACI and RACI were significantly associated with the presence of LV LGE. In addition, patients with cardiac complications had impaired LACI and RACI.",['Meloni A; Saba L; Positano V; Pistoia L; Spasiano A; Putti MC; Casini T; Cossu A; Corigliano E; Massa A; Cademartiri F; Cau R'],2024,"study was based on demographics, clinical data, cardiovascular magnetic resonance findings and cardiac complications. -TM showed increased LACI (22.99  13.58% vs. 16.05  5.28%; p  0.0001) and RACI (27.84  10.30% vs. 17.06  5.03%; p  0.0001)."
Τ cell-mediated adaptive immunity in the transition from metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the progressed version of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) characterized by inflammation and fibrosis, but also a pathophysiological ""hub"" that favors the emergence of liver malignancies. Current research efforts aim to identify risk factors, discover disease biomarkers, and aid patient stratification in the context of MASH-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent cancer among MASLD patients. To investigate the tumorigenic transition in MASH-induced HCC, researchers predominantly exploit preclinical animal-based MASH models and studies based on archived human biopsies and clinical trials. Recapitulating the immune response during tumor development and progression is vital to obtain mechanistic insights into MASH-induced HCC. Notably, the advanced complexity behind MASLD and MASH pathogenesis shifted the research focus towards innate immunity, a fundamental element of the hepatic immune niche that is usually altered robustly in the course of liver disease. During the last few years, however, there has been an increasing interest for deciphering the role of adaptive immunity in MASH-induced HCC, particularly regarding the functions of the various T cell populations. To effectively understand the specific role of T cells in MASH-induced HCC development, scientists should urgently fill the current knowledge gaps in this field. Pinpointing the metabolic signature, sketching the immune landscape, and characterizing the cellular interactions and dynamics of the specific T cells within the MASH-HCC liver are essential to unravel the mechanisms that adaptive immunity exploits to enable the emergence and progression of this cancer. To this end, our review aims to summarize the current state of research regarding the T cell functions linked to MASH-induced HCC.",['Papadopoulos G; Giannousi E; Avdi AP; Velliou RI; Nikolakopoulou P; Chatzigeorgiou A'],2024,"steatohepatitis is the progressed version of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. the disease is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. current research efforts aim to identify risk factors, discover disease biomarkers."
Evaluating a novel online behavioural intervention to encourage cost-conscious strategies among US adults with chronic conditions who are enrolled in a high-deductible health plan: a proof-of-concept pilot study.,"Patients with chronic conditions enrolled in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) face cost-related access barriers and high out-of-pocket spending. Our objectives were to develop a novel behavioural intervention to help HDHP enrollees with chronic conditions use cost-conscious strategies and evaluate the intervention's preliminary effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility. Prospective. Online (USA). 36 US adults enrolled in an HDHP through their employer or an exchange with diabetes, hypertension, asthma, coronary artery disease and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 31/36 participants completed the study. We developed a 5-week intervention consisting of a website with educational modules on discussing costs with clinicians, saving for future healthcare costs, comparing healthcare prices and quality, preparing for appointments, following up after appointments and planning for future healthcare needs; and emails encouraging participants to access each module. We conducted a single-arm proof-of-concept pilot study of the intervention. Baseline and postintervention surveys measured primary outcomes of health insurance literacy and confidence in using cost-conscious strategies. 10 participants completed postintervention interviews. 31 (86%) participants completed a baseline and postintervention survey. Mean health insurance literacy scores (20-80 scale) improved from 56.5 to 67.1 (p<i><</i>0.001). Mean confidence scores (0-10 scale) improved for talking to a healthcare provider about cost (6.1-7.6, p=0.0094), saving for healthcare (5.8-6.6, p<i>=</i>0.068), comparing prices (5.4-6.9, p=0.005) and comparing quality (6.1 to 7.6, p=0.0034). Participants found the website easy to use and helpful for learning about cost-conscious strategies on postintervention interviews. Our novel behavioural intervention was acceptable to HDHP enrollees with chronic conditions, feasible to deliver and associated with increased health insurance literacy and confidence in using cost-conscious strategies. This intervention should be tested in a definitive randomised controlled trial that is fully powered to evaluate its effects on cost-related access barriers, out-of-pocket spending and health outcomes in this growing patient population.",['Peirce A; Lin YJ; Fagerlin A; Heisler M; Levy H; Kullgren J'],2024,"36 adults enrolled in an HDHP through their employer or an exchange with diabetes, hypertension, asthma, coronary artery disease and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 31/36 participants completed the study."
The future of diabetic wound healing: unveiling the potential of mesenchymal stem cell and exosomes therapy.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a significant public health problem and is one of the most challenging medical conditions worldwide. It is the severe complications that make this disease more intricate. A diabetic wound is one of these complications. Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Due to the ineffectiveness of Conventional treatments, growth in limb amputation, morbidity, and mortality have been recognized, which indicates the need for additional treatment. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can significantly improve wound healing. However, there are some risks related to stem cell therapy. Exosome therapy is a new treatment option for diabetic wounds that has shown promising results. However, an even more advanced form called cell-free therapy using exosomes has emerged. This upgraded version of stem cell therapy offers improved efficacy and eliminates the risk of cancer progression. Exosome therapy promotes wound healing from multiple angles, unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on the body's self-healing ability and only provide wound protection. Therefore, exosome therapy has the potential to replace conventional treatments effectively. However, further research is necessary to distinguish the optimal type of stem cells for therapy, ensure their safety, establish appropriate dosing, and identify the best management trail. The present study focused on the current literature on diabetic wound ulcers, their treatment, and mesenchymal stem cell and exosome therapy potential in DFU.",['Memarpour S; Raoufinia R; Saburi E; Razavi MS; Attaran M; Fakoor F; Rahimi HR'],2024,diabetes mellitus is one of the most difficult medical conditions worldwide. patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU)
Paired plasma lipidomics and proteomics analysis in the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition for which there is currently no available medication that can stop its progression. Previous studies suggest that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a phase that precedes the disease. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind MCI conversion to AD is needed. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to detect the key metabolites and proteins involved in MCI progression to AD using data from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery Study. Proteins and metabolites were evaluated separately in multiclass models (controls, MCI and AD) and together in MCI conversion models (MCI stable vs converter). Only features selected as relevant by 3/4 algorithms proposed were kept for downstream analysis. Multiclass models of metabolites highlighted nine features further validated in an independent cohort (0.726 mean balanced accuracy). Among these features, one metabolite, oleamide, was selected by all the algorithms. Further in-vitro experiments in rodents showed that disease-associated microglia excreted oleamide in vesicles. Multiclass models of proteins stood out with nine features, validated in an independent cohort (0.720 mean balanced accuracy). However, none of the proteins was selected by all the algorithms. Besides, to distinguish between MCI stable and converters, 14 key features were selected (0.872 AUC), including tTau, alpha-synuclein (SNCA), junctophilin-3 (JPH3), properdin (CFP) and peptidase inhibitor 15 (PI15) among others. This omics integration approach highlighted a set of molecules associated with MCI conversion important in neuronal and glia inflammation pathways.",['Gómez-Pascual A; Naccache T; Xu J; Hooshmand K; Wretlind A; Gabrielli M; Lombardo MT; Shi L; Buckley NJ; Tijms BM; Vos SJB; Ten Kate M; Engelborghs S; Sleegers K; Frisoni GB; Wallin A; Lleó A; Popp J; Martinez-Lage P; Streffer J; Barkhof F; Zetterberg H; Visser PJ; Lovestone S; Bertram L; Nevado-Holgado AJ; Gualerzi A; Picciolini S; Proitsi P; Verderio C; Botía JA; Legido-Quigley C'],2024,a machine learning approach to detect key metabolites and proteins involved in MCI progression to AD is needed. a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind MCI conversion to AD is needed.
Association of major and minor ECG abnormalities with traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the general population: a large scale study.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be determined and quantified using the electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. Identification of the risk factors associated with ECG abnormalities may advise prevention approaches to decrease CVD burden. In this study we aimed to investigate the association between CVD risk factors and minor and major ECG abnormalities in a general Iranian adult population. This study was conducted in 2010 and covered a population of 9035 males and females aged 35 to 65 years recruiting from the phase I of Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) cohort study. The participants were drawn by a stratified cluster random sampling technique. The Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analysis were conducted considering gender stratification to explore the association of ECG abnormalities with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. There was a significant association between minor and major ECG abnormalities and hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), smoking, and physical activity (p < 0.005). There was a significant trend, in both genders, for increasing major abnormalities as the number of CVD risk factors increased. But, only in women, the minor abnormalities increase in frequency as the number of CVD risk factors increased. The results of multinomial logistic regression showed that men with HTN [ARRR = 1.25, 95% CI 0.99, 1.57] and T2DM [ARRR = 1.31, 95% CI 0.99, 1.74] had the highest likelihood to have major abnormalities, although these are not statistically significant. For women, those with HTN had the highest likelihood to have major [ARRR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.13, 1.63] and minor [ARRR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.15, 1.58] abnormalities. Also, women aged > 60 years were more likely to have major [ARRR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.49, 2.74] and minor [ARRR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.20, 2.10] abnormalities compared to women aged < 45 years. Age and HTN were significantly associated with major and minor ECG abnormalities in women, and, on the other hand, HTN and T2DM were associated with major abnormalities in men. Taken together, these findings suggest that healthcare providers should advise preventive approaches to the asymptomatic adults with both major and minor electrocardiographic abnormalities that may predict cardiovascular risk.",['Sahranavard T; Alimi R; Arabkhazaei J; Nasrabadi M; Alavi Dana SMM; Gholami Y; Izadi-Moud A; Esmaily H; Ebrahimi M; Ferns GA; Moohebati M; Saffar Soflaei S; Ghayour Mobarhan M'],2024,"study aimed to investigate association between CVD risk factors and minor and major ECG abnormalities in a general Iranian adult population. there was a significant association between minor and major ECG abnormalities and hypertension (HTN), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), smoking, and physical activity (p  0.005)"
A Comparison of Adverse Short-Term Outcomes After Forefoot Amputation Based on Patient Height.,"The objective of this investigation was to evaluate adverse short-term outcomes after partial forefoot amputation with a specific comparison performed based on patient height. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was analyzed to select patients with a 28805 Current Procedural Terminology code (amputation, foot; transmetatarsal) who underwent the procedure with ""all layers of incision (deep and superficial) fully closed."" This resulted in 11 patients with a height of 60 inches or less, 202 with a height greater than 60 inches and less than 72 inches, and 55 with a height of 72 inches or greater. Results of the primary outcome measures found no significant differences among groups with respect to the development of a superficial surgical site infection (0% versus 6.4% versus 5.5%; P = .669), deep incisional infection (9.1% versus 3.5% versus 10.9%; P = .076), or wound disruption (0% versus 5.4% versus 5.5%; P = .730). In addition, no significant differences were observed among groups with respect to unplanned reoperations (9.1% versus 16.8% versus 12.7%; P = .630) or unplanned hospital readmissions (45.5% versus 23.3% versus 20.0%; P = .190). The results of this investigation demonstrate no differences in short-term adverse outcomes after partial forefoot amputation with primary closure based on patient height. Although height has previously been described as a potential risk factor in the development of lower-extremity pathogenesis, this finding was not observed in this study from a large US database.",['Kaur K; Cornell RS; Meyr AJ'],2024,the results of this investigation showed no differences in short-term adverse outcomes after partial forefoot amputation with primary closure based on patient height. the results of this investigation demonstrate no differences in short-term adverse outcomes after partial forefoot amputation with primary closure.
Clinical epidemiology and outcomes of emergency department-acute kidney injury: A systematic review.,"Over half of all community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) initially presented to emergency department (ED), but emergency department acute kidney injury (ED-AKI) is poorly characterised, poorly understood with no systematic review, often under-recognized and under-managed. To review the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of ED-AKI, and risk factors of post-ED-AKI mortality globally. We included published prospective or retrospective observational studies, controlled trials, and systematic reviews reporting AKI in adult ED attendees within 24 h of ED admission. Iatrogenic causes of AKI from medical interventions were excluded. We used PubMed to identify articles from 1996 to August 14, 2021, and adopted the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies to assess risk of bias. We used a Forest plot to present pooled ED-AKI incidence rates and I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Other parameters were summarized narratively. Using 24 h from ED admission as the definition for ED-AKI we identified six articles from 2005 to 2018 in high-income settings and one article with a 48-h timeframe. The pooled incidence of ED-AKI was 20 per 1000 adult ED attendances. Risk factors for ED-AKI included increasing age, nursing home residence, previous hospital admission within 30 days, discharge diagnosis of diabetes, obstructive uropathy, sepsis, gastrointestinal medical conditions, high serum creatinine, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, white blood cell, alanine aminotransferase, low serum sodium or albumin on admission, poor premorbid renal function, antibiotic use, active malignancy, lung disease, hyperlipidaemia, and infection. Crude, all-cause 24-h mortality rate was 4.56 % and the one-year mortality rate was 35.04 %. Increasing age and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and malignancy were associated with higher mortality rates. The review reveals a paucity of relevant literature which calls for further research, increased vigilance, red flag identification, and standardized management protocols for ED-AKI.",['Cheung TY; Lam K; Leung SC; Rainer TH'],2024,"ED-AKI is poorly characterised, poorly understood with no systematic review. we included published prospective or retrospective observational studies, controlled trials, and systematic reviews reporting AKI in adult ED attendees within 24 h of ED admission."
Impact of HbA1c control and type 2 diabetes mellitus exposure on the oral microbiome profile in the elderly population.,"To investigate the associations of the oral microbiome status with diabetes characteristics in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A questionnaire was used to assess age, sex, smoking status, drinking status, flossing frequency, T2DM duration and complications, and a blood test was used to determine the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from saliva samples was used to analyze the oral microbiome. Differential analysis revealed that <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Weissella</i> were significantly enriched in the late-stage group, and <i>Capnocytophaga</i> was significantly enriched in the early-stage group. Correlation analysis revealed that diabetes duration was positively correlated with the abundance of <i>Streptococcus</i> (<i>r</i>= 0.369, <i>p</i>= 0.007) and negatively correlated with the abundance of <i>Cardiobacterium</i> (<i>r</i>= -0.337, <i>p</i>= 0.014), and the level of HbA1c was not significantly correlated with the oral microbiome. Network analysis suggested that the poor control group had a more complex microbial network than the control group, a pattern that was similar for diabetes duration. In addition, Streptococcus has a low correlation with other microorganisms. In elderly individuals, <i>Streptococcus</i> emerges as a potential biomarker linked to diabetes, exhibiting elevated abundance in diabetic patients influenced by disease exposure and limited bacterial interactions.",['Zeng X; Huang S; Ye X; Song S; He J; Hu L; Deng S; Liu F'],2024,"a questionnaire was used to assess age, sex, smoking status, drinking status, flossing frequency, T2DM duration and complications. a blood test was used to determine the glycated haemoglobin level."
Outcomes for potentially Resectable patients undergoing primary chemoradiation treatment for T1-T2 HPV Negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Transoral surgical resectability (TOS) is a prognostic factor for patients with HPV+ T1-2 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) disease undergoing radiotherapy (RT), but it is unclear whether this holds for HPV-negative (HPV-) patients. We aimed to compare outcomes of potential TOS-candidates vs. non-TOS candidates, among patients who underwent RT/CRT for early T-stage HPV- OPSCC. For patients treated with RT/CRT for early T-stage HPV-negative OPSCC between 2014 and 2021, pretreatment imaging was reviewed by four head-and-neck surgeons, masked to clinical outcomes, to assess primary-site suitability for TOS. Extracapsular extension (ECE) was assessed by a head-and-neck neuroradiologist. We compared outcomes based on surgical resectability relating to: (1) the primary site tumor alone, and (2) the primary site plus the absence/presence of ECE (overall assessment). Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared using the log-rank test. Seventy patients were included in the analysis. The primary site was TOS-favorable in 46/70 (66%). Based on the overall assessment, 41/70 (58.6%) were TOS-favorable. The 3-year OS, DSS and PFS for primary site TOS-favorable versus unfavorable were OS: 76.9% versus 37.4%; DSS: 78.1% versus 46.2%, PFS: 69.9% versus 41.3%, (log-rank test = 0.01, 0.03, 0.04; respectively). Additionally, patients with an overall assessment of TOS favorability demonstrated better survival outcomes compared with TOS-unfavorable patients (OS: 77.3% vs. 46.2%; DSS: 78.2% vs. 56.5%, PFS: 72.3% vs. 42.1%, log-rank test = 0.01, 0.04, 0.01; respectively).

"Evaluating the economic efficiency of open, laparoscopic, and robotic distal pancreatectomy: an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis.","This study compared the cost-effectiveness of open (ODP), laparoscopic (LDP), and robotic (RDP) distal pancreatectomy (DP). Studies reporting the costs of DP were included in a literature search until August 2023. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted, and surface under cumulative ranking area (SUCRA) values, mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR), and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) were calculated for outcomes of interest. Cluster analysis was performed to examine the similarity and classification of DP approaches into homogeneous clusters. A decision model-based cost-utility analysis was conducted for the cost-effectiveness analysis of DP strategies. Twenty-six studies with 29,164 patients were included in the analysis. Among the three groups, LDP had the lowest overall costs, while ODP had the highest overall costs (LDP vs. ODP: MD - 3521.36, 95% CrI - 6172.91 to - 1228.59). RDP had the highest procedural costs (ODP vs. RDP: MD - 4311.15, 95% CrI - 6005.40 to - 2599.16; LDP vs. RDP: MD - 3772.25, 95% CrI - 4989.50 to - 2535.16), but incurred the lowest hospitalization costs. Both LDP (MD - 3663.82, 95% CrI - 6906.52 to - 747.69) and RDP (MD - 6678.42, 95% CrI - 11,434.30 to - 2972.89) had significantly reduced hospitalization costs compared to ODP. LDP and RDP demonstrated a superior profile regarding costs-morbidity, costs-mortality, costs-efficacy, and costs-utility compared to ODP. Compared to ODP, LDP and RDP cost $3110 and $817 less per patient, resulting in 0.03 and 0.05 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, with positive incremental net monetary benefit (NMB). RDP costs $2293 more than LDP with a negative incremental NMB but generates 0.02 additional QALYs with improved postoperative morbidity and spleen preservation.

The benefit from anti-PD-1 therapy is enriched in patients with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS)-positive or CPS-high tumors compared with patients with PD-L1 CPS-negative or CPS-low tumors. In this phase 1b/2 study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab, a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative unresectable advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. The primary endpoint was the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for phase 1b and the objective response rate for phase 2. Secondary endpoints included disease control rate, duration of response, time to response, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS) and safety. The primary endpoint was met. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed during dose escalation in phase 1b; the recommended phase 2 dose was determined as 6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> every 2 weeks. The objective response rate was 52.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 41.6-62.5), consisting of complete and partial responses in 4.3% and 47.9% of patients, respectively. The median duration of response, progression-free survival and OS were 13.73 months (95% CI = 7.79-19.12), 8.18 months (95% CI = 6.67-10.48) and 17.48 months (95% CI = 12.35-26.55), respectively.

Mitral regurgitation assessment by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging during continuous in-scanner exercise: a feasibility study.,"Exercise imaging using current modalities can be challenging. This was patient focused study to establish the feasibility and reproducibility of exercise-cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (EX-CMR) acquired during continuous in-scanner exercise in asymptomatic patients with primary mitral regurgitation (MR). This was a prospective, feasibility study. Biventricular volumes/function, aortic flow volume, MR volume (MR-Rvol) and regurgitant fraction (MR-RF) were assessed at rest and during low- (Low-EX) and moderate-intensity exercise (Mod-EX) in asymptomatic patients with primary MR. Twenty-five patients completed EX-CMR without complications. Whilst there were no significant changes in the left ventricular (LV) volumes, there was a significant increase in the LVEF (rest 63 ± 5% vs. Mod-EX 68 ± 6%;p = 0.01). There was a significant reduction in the right ventricular (RV) end-systolic volume (rest 68 ml(60-75) vs. Mod-EX 46 ml(39-59);p < 0.001) and a significant increase in the RV ejection fraction (rest 55 ± 5% vs. Mod-EX 65 ± 8%;p < 0.001). Whilst overall, there were no significant group changes in the MR-Rvol and MR-RF, individual responses were variable, with MR-Rvol increasing by ≥ 15 ml in 4(16%) patients and decreasing by ≥ 15 ml in 9(36%) of patients. The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of LV volumes and aortic flow measurements were excellent, including at Mod-EX. EX-CMR is feasible and reproducible in patients with primary MR.

Germline NPAT inactivating variants as cause of hereditary colorectal cancer.,"Two independent exome sequencing initiatives aimed to identify new genes involved in the predisposition to nonpolyposis colorectal cancer led to the identification of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NPAT, a gene that encodes a cyclin E/CDK2 effector required for S phase entry and a coactivator of histone transcription, in two families with multiple members affected with colorectal cancer. Enrichment of loss-of-function and predicted deleterious NPAT variants was identified in familial/early-onset colorectal cancer patients compared to non-cancer gnomAD individuals, further supporting the association with the disease. Previous studies in Drosophila models showed that NPAT abrogation results in chromosomal instability, increase of double strand breaks, and induction of tumour formation. In line with these results, colorectal cancers with NPAT somatic variants and no DNA repair defects have significantly higher aneuploidy levels than NPAT-wildtype colorectal cancers. In conclusion, our findings suggest that constitutional inactivating NPAT variants predispose to mismatch repair-proficient nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.",['Terradas M; Schubert SA; Viana-Errasti J; Ruano D; Aiza G; Nielsen M; Marciel P; Tops CM; Parra G; Morreau H; Torrents D; van Leerdam ME; Capellá G; de Miranda NFCC; Valle L; van Wezel T'],2024,"NPAT abrogation results in chromosomal instability, increase of double strand breaks, and induction of tumour formation.

Ethnic minorities treated with new-generation drug-eluting coronary stents in two European randomised clinical trials.,"Several ethnic minorities have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, but previous European trials that investigated clinical outcome after coronary stenting did not assess the patients' ethnic background. To compare ethnic minority and Western European trial participants in terms of both cardiovascular risk profile and 1‑year clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention. In the BIO-RESORT and BIONYX randomised trials, which assessed new-generation drug-eluting stents, information on patients' self-reported ethnic background was prospectively collected. Pooled patient-level data of 5803 patients, enrolled in the Netherlands and Belgium, were analysed in this prespecified analysis. The main endpoint was target vessel failure after 1 year. Patients were classified as belonging to an ethnic minority (n = 293, 5%) or of Western European origin (n = 5510, 95%). Follow-up data were available in 5772 of 5803 (99.5%) patients. Ethnic minority patients were younger, less often female, more often current smokers, more often medically treated for diabetes, and more often had a positive family history of coronary artery disease. The main endpoint target vessel failure did not differ between ethnic minority and Western European patients (3.5% vs 4.9%, hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.38-1.33; p = 0.28). There was also no difference in mortality, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularisation rates. Despite the unfavourable cardiovascular risk profile of ethnic minority patients, short-term clinical outcome after treatment with contemporary drug-eluting stents was highly similar to that in Western European patients. Further efforts should be made to ensure the enrolment of more ethnic minority patients in future coronary stent trials.",['Ploumen EH; Semedo E; Doggen CJM; Schotborgh CE; Anthonio RL; Danse PW; Benit E; Aminian A; Stoel MG; Hartmann M; van Houwelingen KG; Scholte M; Roguin A; Linssen GCM; Zocca P; von Birgelen C'],2024,ethnic minority and Western European trials investigated clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention. previous trials that investigated clinical outcome did not assess ethnic background. ethnic minority patients classified as belonging to ethnic minority.

Self-supervised learning of accelerometer data provides new insights for sleep and its association with mortality.,"Sleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. We developed a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry. After exclusion, 1448 participant nights of data were used for training. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 min (95% limits of agreement (LoA): -37.8-107.2 min) for total sleep duration, 2.6 min for REM duration (95% LoA: -68.4-73.4 min) and 32.1 min (95% LoA: -54.4-118.5 min) for NREM duration. The sleep classifier was deployed in the UK Biobank with 100,000 participants to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (<6 h) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration of 6-7.9 h, regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.58; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.19-2.11) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.45; 95% CIs: 1.16-1.81). Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.",['Yuan H; Plekhanova T; Walmsley R; Reynolds AC; Maddison KJ; Bucan M; Gehrman P; Rowlands A; Ray DW; Bennett D; McVeigh J; Straker L; Eastwood P; Kyle SD; Doherty A'],2024,sleep classification techniques rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification was developed.
Dosimetric Effect of Target Position Accuracy on Single-Isocenter Multiple Liver Metastases SBRT.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To evaluate the dosimetric effects of intrafraction baseline shifts combined with rotational errors on Four-dimensional computed tomography-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for multiple liver metastases (MLMs). <b>Methods:</b> A total of 10 patients with MLM (2 or 3 lesions) were selected for this retrospective study. Baseline shift errors of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm; and rotational errors of 0.5°, 1°, and 1.5°, were simulated about all axes. All of the baseline shifts and rotation errors were simulated around the planned isocenter using a matrix transformation of 6° of freedom. The coverage degradation of baseline shifts and rotational errors were analyzed according to the dose to 95% of the planning target volume (D95) and the volume covered by 95% of the prescribed dose (V95), and related changes in gross tumor volume were also analyzed. <b>Results:</b> At the rotation error of 0.5° and the baseline offset of less than 0.5 mm, the D95 and V95 values of all targets were >95%. For rotational errors of 1.0° (combined with all baseline shift errors), 36.3% of targets had D95 and V95 values of <95%. Coverage worsened substantially when the baseline shift errors were increased to 1.0 mm. D95 and V95 values were >95% for about 77.3% of the targets. Only 11.4% of the D95 and V95 values were >95% when the baseline shift errors were increased to 2.0 mm. When the rotational error was increased to 1.5° and baseline shift errors increased to 1.0 mm, the D95 and V95 values were >95% in only 3 cases. <b>Conclusions:</b> The multivariate regression model analysis in this study showed that the coverage of the target decreased further with reduced target volume, increasing the baseline drift, the rotation error, and the distance to the target.",['Zhang Y; Niu S; Yuan J; Wang X; Gong C; Tang C'],2024,baseline shifts and rotational errors were simulated around the planned isocenter. all of the baseline shifts and rotational errors were simulated around the planned isocenter.
Longitudinal artificial intelligence-based deep learning models for diagnosis and prediction of the future occurrence of polyneuropathy in diabetes and prediabetes.,"The objective of this study was to develop artificial intelligence-based deep learning models and assess their potential utility and accuracy in diagnosing and predicting the future occurrence of diabetic distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and prediabetes. In 394 patients (T2DM=300, Prediabetes=94), we developed a DSPN diagnostic and predictive model using Random Forest (RF)-based variable selection techniques, specifically incorporating the combined capabilities of the Clinical Toronto Neuropathy Score (TCNS) and nerve conduction study (NCS) to identify relevant variables. These important variables were then integrated into a deep learning framework comprising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. To evaluate temporal predictive efficacy, patients were assessed at enrollment and one-year follow-up. RF-based variable selection identified key factors for diagnosing DSPN. Numbness scores, sensory test results (vibration), reflexes (knee, ankle), sural nerve attributes (sensory nerve action potential [SNAP] amplitude, nerve conduction velocity [NCV], latency), and peroneal/tibial motor NCV were candidate variables at baseline and over one year. Tibial compound motor action potential amplitudes were used for initial diagnosis, and ulnar SNAP amplitude for subsequent diagnoses. CNNs and LSTMs achieved impressive AUC values of 0.98 for DSPN diagnosis prediction, and 0.93 and 0.89 respectively for predicting the future occurrence of DSPN. RF techniques combined with two deep learning algorithms exhibited outstanding performance in diagnosing and predicting the future occurrence of DSPN. These algorithms have the potential to serve as surrogate measures, aiding clinicians in accurate diagnosis and future prediction of DSPN.",['Lai YR; Chiu WC; Huang CC; Cheng BC; Kung CT; Lin TY; Chiang HC; Tsai CJ; Kung CF; Lu CH'],2024,DSPN diagnosis prediction was performed by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. a study was carried out by a team of 394 patients. the results were based on random forest (RF)-based variables.
Abbreviated Breast MRI for Supplemental Screening in Patients With Dense Breasts: Comparison of Baseline Versus Subsequent-Round Examinations.,"<b>Background:</b> Abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MR) achieves a higher cancer detection rate (CDR) versus digital breast tomosynthesis when applied for baseline (i.e. first-round) supplemental screening in individuals with dense breasts. Limited literature has evaluated subsequent (i.e., sequential) AB-MR screening rounds. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to compare outcomes between baseline and subsequent rounds of screening AB-MR in individuals with dense breasts at otherwise average risk of breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study included patients with dense breasts and at otherwise average breast-cancer risk who underwent AB-MR for supplemental screening between December 20, 2016 and May 10, 2023. Clinical interpretations and results of recommended biopsies for AB-MR examinations were extracted from the EMR. Baseline and subsequent-round AB-MR examinations were compared. <b>Results:</b> The final sample included 2585 AB-MR examinations (2007 baseline, 578 subsequent-round) performed for supplemental screening in 2007 women (mean age, 57.1 years) with dense breasts. Among baseline examinations, 1658 (82.6%) were assessed as BI-RADS category 1 or 2, 171 (8.5%) as category 3, and 178 (8.9%) as category 4 or 5. Among subsequent-round examinations, 533 (92.2%) were assessed as BI-RADS category 1 or 2, 20 (3.5%) as category 3, and 25 (4.3%) as category 4 or 5 (p<.001). Abnormal interpretation rate (AIR) was 17.4% (349/2007) among baseline examinations, versus 7.8% (45/578) among subsequent-round examinations (p<.001). Among baseline examinations, PPV2 was 21.3% (38/178), PPV3 was 26.6% (38/143), and CDR was 18.9 per 1000 (38/2007). Among subsequent-round examinations PPV2 was 28.0% (7/25) (p=.45), PPV3 was 29.2% (7/24) (p=.81), and CDR was 12.1 per 1000 (7/578) (p=.37). All 45 cancers diagnosed by baseline or subsequent-round AB-MR were stage 0 or 1. Seven cancers diagnosed by subsequent-round AB-MR had a mean interval since prior AB-MR of 872 days, size of 0.3-1.2 cm, and node-negative status at surgical axillary evaluation. <b>Conclusion:</b> Subsequent rounds of AB-MR screening in individuals with dense breasts had lower AIR compared to baseline examinations while maintaining high CDR. All cancers detected by subsequent-round examinations were early-stage node-negative cancers. <b>Clinical Impact:</b> The findings support sequential AB-MR for supplemental screening in individuals with dense breasts. Further investigations are warranted to optimize the screening interval.","[""Edmonds CE; Weinstein SP; McDonald ES; Bagheri S; Zuckerman SP; O'Brien SR; Schnall MD; Conant EF""]",2024,AB-MR achieves a higher cancer detection rate (CDR) versus digital breast tomosynthesis. results were extracted from the EMR.
An On-Treatment Decreased Trend of Serum IL-6 and IL-8 as Predictive Markers Quickly Reflects Short-Term Efficacy of PD-1 Blockade Immunochemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Gastric Cancer.,"Immunotherapy has proven effective in treating advanced gastric cancer (AGC), yet its benefits are limited to a subset of patients. Our aim is to swiftly identify prognostic biomarkers using cytokines to improve the precision of clinical guidance and decision-making for PD-1 inhibitor-based cancer immunotherapy in AGC. The retrospective study compared 36 patients with AGC who received combined anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and chemotherapy (immunochemotherapy) with a control group of 20 patients who received chemotherapy alone. The concentrations of TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17 in the serum were assessed using chemiluminescence immunoassay at three distinct time intervals following the commencement of immunochemotherapy. When compared to controls, patients undergoing immunochemotherapy demonstrated a generalized rise in cytokine levels after the start of treatment. However, patients who benefited from immunochemotherapy showed a decrease in IL-6 or IL-8 concentrations throughout treatment (with varied trends observed for IL-1<i>β</i>, IL-2R, IL-10, IL-17, and TNF-<i>α</i>) was evident in patients benefiting from immunochemotherapy but not in those who did not benefit. Among these markers, the combination of IL-6, IL-8, and CEA showed optimal predictive performance for short-term efficacy of immunochemotherapy in AGC patients. Reductions in IL-6/IL-8 levels observed during immunochemotherapy correlated with increased responsiveness to treatment effectiveness. These easily accessible blood-based biomarkers are predictive and rapid and may play a crucial role in identifying individuals likely to derive benefits from PD-1 blockade immunotherapy.",['Liu J; Mao Y; Mao C; Wang D; Dong L; Zhu W'],2024,"a retrospective study compared 36 patients with a group of 20 patients who received immunochemotherapy alone. the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17 in the serum were assessed. a decrease in IL-6 or IL-8 concentrations was evident in patients benefiting from immunochemotherapy but not in those who did not benefit."
Type II diabetes mellitus increases the risk of inflammatory bowel disease in a prospective cohort study.,"Inflammatory bowel disease is a common digestive disorder and diabetes can lead to intestinal dysfunction. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease in combination with diabetes present a higher rate of hospitalization and consumption of medical resources, yet the association between type 2 diabetes and Inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown. We studied 313,008 participants from the UK Biobank, including 5891 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline. Multivariate Cox proportional risk models were constructed to examine the risks associated with type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease and its subtypes (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis). Potential confounders including sociodemographic, lifestyle, physical body indicators, psychological state, hypertension, and thyroid-related disorders were adjusted. Propensity score matching was also performed to analyze their sensitivity. Of a total of 313,008 participants included in the study, 5891 (1.88 %) were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline and 1829 (0.58 %) of the entire cohort developed inflammatory bowel disease during follow-up, with a median follow-up time of 13.72 years. Patients with type 2 diabetes had a higher cumulative risk of inflammatory bowel disease compared to the non-type 2 diabetes population (inflammatory bowel disease: 1.24% vs. 0.57%, p < 0.001; Crohn's disease: 0.46% vs. 0.15%, p < 0.001; ulcerative colitis: 0.73% vs. 0.35%, p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that type 2 diabetes was independently associated with inflammatory bowel disease (Hazard Ratio: 1.61 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.26-2.06], p < 0.001), Crohn's disease (Hazard Ratio: 2.10 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.39-3.17], p < 0.001) and ulcerative colitis (Hazard Ratio: 1.58 [95% Confidence Interval: 1.15-2.18], p = 0.005).

A Cross-Sectional Observational Study to Assess the Efficacy of Triglyceride to High-Density Lipoprotein Ratio as a Marker of Insulin Resistance in Subjects of Central Rural India.,"The rising prevalence of insulin resistance (IR), obesity, and its complications in India is due to lifestyle changes, eating patterns, stress, and genetic factors. Markers for IR are often expensive, invasive, or impractical for use in economically disadvantaged or remote areas. To address this, we evaluated the efficacy of the triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein (TG/HDL) ratio as a simple, reliable, accessible, and affordable surrogate marker of IR in comparison to the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). This cross-sectional observational study was performed at a tertiary care center in central India and included 815 subjects aged 18 to 60 years after excluding those with systemic diseases, drugs affecting weight, or pregnant or lactating women. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was done to represent the study findings. Males and obese subjects were more insulin resistant than females and non-obese subjects, respectively. The TG/HDL had a sensitivity of 91.81%, a specificity of 92.88%, a positive predictive value of 94.46%, and a negative predictive value of 89.56%, with a diagnostic accuracy of 92.27% when compared to HOMA-IR. We concluded that TG/HDL serves as a simple, affordable, and accurate marker of IR in a diverse population of central India.

Models were trained on data from White British and other ancestries and validated across a cohort of over 96,000 individuals for 8 diseases. Out of 96 models trained, we report 16 with statistically significant incremental predictive performance in terms of ROC-AUC scores (p-value < 0.05), found for diabetes, arthritis, gall stones, cystitis, asthma and osteoarthritis. For the interaction and pretrained models that outperformed the baseline, the PRS score was the primary driver behind prediction.

Myeloid AMPK signaling restricts fibrosis but is not required for metformin improvements during CDAHFD-induced NASH in mice.,"Metabolic programming underpins inflammatory processes of immune cells. In the context of chronic liver disease, liver macrophage activation and response to hepatocellular damage is dependent on profound metabolic changes. Here, we sought to identify the role of an important metabolic regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), specifically within myeloid cells during the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and whether treatment with metformin, a first line therapy for diabetes and activator of AMPK could stem disease progression. Male and female Prkaa1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Prkaa2<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Flox) control and Flox-LysM-Cre<sup>+</sup> (MacKO) mice were fed a low-fat control or a choline-deficient, amino acid defined 45% Kcal high fat diet (CDAHFD) for 8 weeks, where metformin was introduced in the drinking water (50 or 250 mg/kg/day) for the last 4 weeks. Hepatic steatosis and fibrosis were dramatically increased in response to CDAHFD-feeding compared to low-fat control. While myeloid AMPK signaling had no effect on markers of hepatic steatosis or circulating markers, fibrosis as measured by total liver collagen was significantly elevated in livers from MacKO mice, independent of sex. Although treatment with 50 mg/kg/day metformin had no effect on any parameter, intervention with 250 mg/kg/day metformin completely ameliorated hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in both male and female mice. While the protective effect of metformin was associated with lower final body weight, decrease expression of lipogenic and Col1a1 transcripts, it was independent of myeloid AMPK signaling. These results suggest that endogenous AMPK signaling in myeloid cells, both liver-resident and infiltrating, acts to restrict fibrogenesis during CDAHFD-induced NASH progression but is not the mechanism by which metformin improves markers of NASH.","[""Nunes JRC; O'Dwyer C; Ghorbani P; Smith TKT; Chauhan S; Robert-Gostlin V; Girouard MD; Viollet B; Foretz M; Fullerton MD""]",2024,AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic regulator. it is specifically within myeloid cells during the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. fibrosis was significantly increased in response to CDAHFD-feeding.
Association between lipid accumulation product and psoriasis among adults: a nationally representative cross-sectional study.,"Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is an accessible and relatively comprehensive assessment of obesity that represents both anatomical and physiological lipid accumulation. Obesity and psoriasis are potentially related, according to previous research. Investigating the relationship between adult psoriasis and the LAP index was the goal of this study. This is a cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006 and 2009-2014. The association between LAP and psoriasis was examined using multivariate logistic regression and smoothed curve fitting. To verify whether this relationship was stable across populations, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were performed. The LAP index showed a positive correlation with psoriasis in 9,781 adult participants who were 20 years of age or older. A 27% elevated probability of psoriasis was linked to every unit increase in ln LAP in the fully adjusted model (Model 3: OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.06-1.52). In comparison with participants in the lowest ln LAP quartile, those in the highest quartile had an 83% greater likelihood of psoriasis (Model 3: OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08-3.11). This positive correlation was more pronounced for young males, participants who had never smoked, non-drinkers, participants who exercised little, as well as non-hypertensive and non-diabetic participants. This study found that the LAP index and adult psoriasis were positively correlated, especially in young males without comorbidities. Therefore, it is proposed that LAP may serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis of psoriasis and tracking the effectiveness of treatment.",['Zhang C; Dong X; Chen J; Liu F'],2024,"study based on data from the national health and nutrition examination survey. psoriasis and psoriasis are potentially related, according to previous research."
The long-term effects of blood urea nitrogen levels on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in diabetes: a prospective cohort study.,"The long-term effects of blood urea nitrogen(BUN) in patients with diabetes remain unknown. Current studies reporting the target BUN level in patients with diabetes are also limited. Hence, this prospective study aimed to explore the relationship of BUN with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in patients with diabetes. In total, 10,507 participants with diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018) were enrolled. The causes and numbers of deaths were determined based on the National Death Index mortality data from the date of NHANES interview until follow-up (December 31, 2019). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) of mortality. Of the adult participants with diabetes, 4963 (47.2%) were female. The median (interquartile range) BUN level of participants was 5 (3.93-6.43) mmol/L. After 86,601 person-years of follow-up, 2,441 deaths were documented. After adjusting for variables, the HRs of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in the highest BUN level group were 1.52 and 1.35, respectively, compared with those in the lowest BUN level group. With a one-unit increment in BUN levels, the HRs of all-cause and CVD mortality rates were 1.07 and 1.08, respectively. The results remained robust when several sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed. Moreover, BUN showed a nonlinear association with all-cause and CVD mortality.

"Clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of venetoclax, a selective B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor.","Venetoclax, a highly potent BCL-2 inhibitor, is indicated for treatment of some hematologic malignancies as monotherapy, and/or in combination with other agents. Venetoclax pharmacokinetics has been extensively characterized in patients and healthy participants. After oral dosing, the median time to reach maximum plasma concentration ranged from 5 to 8 h and harmonic mean half-life ranged from 14 to 18 h. Food increases venetoclax bioavailability by 3-5-fold and venetoclax should be administered with food to ensure adequate and consistent bioavailability. Venetoclax is eliminated via cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A metabolism, and a negligible amount of unchanged drug is excreted in urine. Strong CYP3A/P-glycoprotein inhibitors increased venetoclax exposures (AUC) by 1.44- to 6.90-fold while a significant decrease (71%) has been observed when dosed with strong CYP3 inducers. Venetoclax does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes or transporters. Venetoclax pharmacokinetics is not appreciably altered by age, weight, sex, but the exposure is up to twofold higher in participants from Asian countries. Mild-to-severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease do not alter venetoclax exposures, and venetoclax is not cleared by dialysis. Although mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment does not affect venetoclax exposures, twofold higher exposure was observed in subjects with severe hepatic impairment. Venetoclax exposure is comparable across patients with different hematologic malignancies and healthy participants. Overall, venetoclax exposure is only affected by food and CYP3A modulators and is only higher in Asian subjects and subjects with severe hepatic impairment.

In this review, we comprehensively summarized the association between diet and the early-onset CRC, clarified the association and relative risk between different dietary patterns, common food types and nutrients and the occurrence of early-onset CRC, and elaborated the underlying physiological mechanisms. Enhancing the understanding of dietary risk factors, which are modifiable exogenous risk factors, is expected to serve as a reference for the formulation of primary prevention strategies for early-onset CRC.",['Lu B; Jin T; Liu CC; Xiao Q; Dai M'],2024,early-onset cancer is closely related to modifiable risk factors such as diet. there is still a lack of consistent conclusions and a systematic review of relevant research results.
Real-life use of ropeg-interferon α2b in polycythemia vera: patient selection and clinical outcomes.,"Ropeginterferon-alfa2b (ropegIFNα2b) is a long-acting IFN formulation with broad FDA/EMA approval as a therapy of polycythemia vera (PV) with no symptomatic splenomegaly. There is currently lack of information on the real-world patient selection, including the impact of local reimbursement policies, and drug management, particularly: type/timing of screening and follow-up tests; absolute/relative contraindications to therapy; ropegIFNα2b dose and combinations with hydroxyurea. As a sub-analysis of the PV-ARC retrospective study (NCT06134102), we here report our monocenter experience with ropegIFNα2b in the period from January 2021, corresponding to drug availability outside clinical trial, and December 2023. Among the 149 patients with EMA/FDA indication, only 55 (36.9%) met the local reimbursement criteria and 18 (12.1%) received ropegIFNα2b. Thanks to appropriate screening, relative/absolute contraindications to ropegIFNα2b were detected and managed in a multidisciplinary manner. Efficacy and safety of ropegIFNα2b was confirmed, with 3 cases of early molecular response. General use of low ropegIFNα2b dose, with frequent need for hydroxyurea combinations, was noted. This real-world experience suggests a significant impact of local regulations on drug prescription and the need for greater real-world data collection on ropegIFNα2b in PV patients. Also, it describes appropriate multidisciplinary screening and monitoring procedures during ropegIFNα2b therapy.",['Palandri F; Branzanti F; Venturi M; Dedola A; Fontana G; Loffredo M; Patuelli A; Ottaviani E; Bersani M; Reta M; Addimanda O; Vicennati V; Vianelli N; Cavo M'],2024,"a sub-analysis of the PV-ARC retrospective study reveals the real-world experience with ropegIFN2b. only 55 (36.9%) met the local reimbursement criteria and 18 (12.1%) received ropegIFN2b.

Use of Artificial Intelligence Chatbots in Interpretation of Pathology Reports.,"Anatomic pathology reports are an essential part of health care, containing vital diagnostic and prognostic information. Currently, most patients have access to their test results online. However, the reports are complex and are generally incomprehensible to laypeople. Artificial intelligence chatbots could potentially simplify pathology reports. To evaluate the ability of large language model chatbots to accurately explain pathology reports to patients. This cross-sectional study used 1134 pathology reports from January 1, 2018, to May 31, 2023, from a multispecialty hospital in Brooklyn, New York. A new chat was started for each report, and both chatbots (Bard [Google Inc], hereinafter chatbot 1; GPT-4 [OpenAI], hereinafter chatbot 2) were asked in sequential prompts to explain the reports in simple terms and identify key information. Chatbot responses were generated between June 1 and August 31, 2023. The mean readability scores of the original and simplified reports were compared. Two reviewers independently screened and flagged reports with potential errors. Three pathologists reviewed the flagged reports and categorized them as medically correct, partially medically correct, or medically incorrect; they also recorded any instances of hallucinations. Outcomes included improved mean readability scores and a medically accurate interpretation. For the 1134 reports included, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level decreased from a mean of 13.19 (95% CI, 12.98-13.41) to 8.17 (95% CI, 8.08-8.25; t = 45.29; P < .001) by chatbot 1 and 7.45 (95% CI, 7.35-7.54; t = 49.69; P < .001) by chatbot 2. The Flesch Reading Ease score was increased from a mean of 10.32 (95% CI, 8.69-11.96) to 61.32 (95% CI, 60.80-61.84; t = -63.19; P < .001) by chatbot 1 and 70.80 (95% CI, 70.32-71.28; t = -74.61; P < .001) by chatbot 2. Chatbot 1 interpreted 993 reports (87.57%) correctly, 102 (8.99%) partially correctly, and 39 (3.44%) incorrectly; chatbot 2 interpreted 1105 reports (97.44%) correctly, 24 (2.12%) partially correctly, and 5 (0.44%) incorrectly. Chatbot 1 had 32 instances of hallucinations (2.82%), while chatbot 2 had 3 (0.26%). The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that artificial intelligence chatbots were able to simplify pathology reports. However, some inaccuracies and hallucinations occurred. Simplified reports should be reviewed by clinicians before distribution to patients.",['Steimetz E; Minkowitz J; Gabutan EC; Ngichabe J; Attia H; Hershkop M; Ozay F; Hanna MG; Gupta R'],2024,"artificial intelligence chatbots could potentially simplify pathology reports. a cross-sectional study used 1134 pathology reports from January 1, 2018 to May 31, 2023. the results included improved mean readability scores and a medically accurate interpretation."
Construction and validation of an innovative prognostic nomogram for overall survival in cervical cancer patients with lung metastasis: an analysis utilizing the SEER database.,"To facilitate patient consultation and assist in clinical decision-making, we developed a predictive model to analyze the overall survival (OS) rate of cervical cancer patients with concurrent lung metastasis for 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years. We extracted data on patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and concurrent lung metastasis between 2010 and 2020 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Through a random assignment process, these patients were allocated to either a training cohort or a validation cohort, maintaining a 7:3 ratio. Utilizing both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we determined the independent prognostic factors influencing OS. To enhance predictive accuracy, we developed a nomogram model incorporating these identified independent prognostic variables. Model effectiveness was subsequently assessed using various metrics, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). We gathered data on 1330 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer with lung metastases. An OS nomogram was developed, accounting for factors such as histological type, presence of metastases in other organs (brain, liver), surgical interventions, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The ROC curves, calibration plots, and DCA curves demonstrated the commendable predictive performance of the nomogram in assessing the prognosis of cervical cancer patients with lung metastases in both the training and validation cohorts. By utilizing clinical data from the SEER database, we have effectively devised a nomogram capable of predicting the 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year survival rates of cervical cancer patients with lung metastases. The nomogram boasts high accuracy, offering precise prognostic predictions. Its implementation can guide the formulation of individualized follow-up and treatment plans for enhanced patient care.",['Chang L; Zhao K'],2024,"we extracted data from the SEER database on cervical cancer patients. using clinical data, we developed a nomogram to assess the overall survival rate of cervical cancer patients with lung metastases."
Newer generations of multi-target CAR and STAb-T immunotherapeutics: NEXT CART Consortium as a cooperative effort to overcome current limitations.,"Adoptive T cellular immunotherapies have emerged as relevant approaches for treating cancer patients who have relapsed or become refractory (R/R) to traditional cancer treatments. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has improved survival in various hematological malignancies. However, significant limitations still impede the widespread adoption of these therapies in most cancers. To advance in this field, six research groups have created the ""NEXT Generation CART MAD Consortium"" (NEXT CART) in Madrid's Community, which aims to develop novel cell-based immunotherapies for R/R and poor prognosis cancers. At NEXT CART, various basic and translational research groups and hospitals in Madrid concur to share and synergize their basic expertise in immunotherapy, gene therapy, and immunological synapse, and clinical expertise in pediatric and adult oncology. NEXT CART goal is to develop new cell engineering approaches and treatments for R/R adult and pediatric neoplasms to evaluate in multicenter clinical trials. Here, we discuss the current limitations of T cell-based therapies and introduce our perspective on future developments. Advancement opportunities include developing allogeneic products, optimizing CAR signaling domains, combining cellular immunotherapies, multi-targeting strategies, and improving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)/T cell receptor (TCR) therapy. Furthermore, basic studies aim to identify novel tumor targets, tumor molecules in the tumor microenvironment that impact CAR efficacy, and strategies to enhance the efficiency of the immunological synapse between immune and tumor cells. Our perspective of current cellular immunotherapy underscores the potential of these treatments while acknowledging the existing hurdles that demand innovative solutions to develop their potential for cancer treatment fully.",['Martín-Antonio B; Blanco B; González-Murillo Á; Hidalgo L; Minguillón J; Pérez-Chacón G'],2024,"six research groups have created the ""NEXT Generation CART MAD Consortium"" to develop novel cell-based immunotherapies for R/R and poor prognosis cancers. the ""NEXT Generation CART MAD Consortium"" is a consortium of research groups and hospitals in the u.s. and europe."
A Rare Case of Tumor-to-Tumor Metastasis: Renal Cell Carcinoma Metastasis to Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid malignancy. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastasis to the thyroid, albeit the most common carcinomatous metastasis to the thyroid, is rare, and tumor-to-tumor metastasis of RCC to PTC is even rarer. We present a case of a 65-year-old male with a history of RCC who presented with a thyroid nodule 7 years after left radical nephrectomy. Imaging showed the thyroid nodule predating the kidney tumor. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed and showed 2 distinct cell populations, 1 of which was stained with RCC markers and another that was stained positively for thyroid markers. An interpretation of atypia of undetermined significance was rendered and molecular testing was indeterminate with ThyGeNEXT not detecting mutations and ThyraMIR positive for a level 2 microRNA pattern consistent with low risk for malignancy. The patient elected for active surveillance until follow-up thyroid ultrasound showed continued growth. At this point, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed. Pathology confirmed clear cell RCC metastasis to an infiltrative follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma. This case highlights the possibility of tumor-to-tumor metastasis in patients with a previous history of RCC even years after nephrectomy and in the absence of other metastatic lesions.",['Tadisina S; Sami F; Mettman D; Ridella M'],2024,a 65-year-old male with a history of RCC presented with a thyroid nodule 7 years after left radical nephrectomy. a biopsy showed the thyroid nodule predating the kidney tumor. a right hemithyroidectomy was performed.
A Prospective Trial of Single-Fraction Radiation to the Tumor Bed with a Novel Breast-Specific Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Device: The GammaPod.,"Radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer is typically delivered in a hypofractionated regimen to the whole breast followed by a tumor bed boost. This results in a treatment course of approximately 4 weeks. In this study, the tumor bed boost was delivered in a single fraction as part of a safety and feasibility study for FDA clearance of the device. Eligible women with early-stage breast cancer underwent lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy. Patients underwent breast immobilization using a system specific to the GammaPod followed by CT simulation, boost treatment planning, and boost treatment delivery all in a single treatment day. Patients then started whole-breast radiation therapy within 1 week of the boost treatment. Patients and treatments were assessed for safety and feasibility. Acute toxicities were recorded. A single-fraction boost of 8 Gy was delivered to the tumor bed before a course of whole-breast radiation. The GammaPod treatment was successfully delivered to 14 of 17 enrolled patients. Acute toxicities from all radiation therapy, inclusive of the boost and whole-breast radiation, were limited to grade 1 events. The GammaPod device successfully delivered a single-fraction boost treatment to the tumor bed with no change in expected acute toxicities. The results of this study led to FDA clearance of the device through the Investigational Device Exemption process at the FDA. The GammaPod is in clinical use at 4e institutions nationally and internationally, with additional sites pending in 2023.",['Nichols EM; Bentzen SM; Milburn M; Kesmodel SB; Bellavance E; Becker SJ; Mutaf Y; Tkaczuk K; Rosenblatt P; Feigenberg SJ'],2024,the tumor bed boost was delivered in a single fraction. the results of this study led to FDA clearance of the device. the device is in clinical use at 4e institutions nationally and internationally.
Interplay Between Diabetes Mellitus and the Occurrence of Osteoarthritis and Associated Conditions in Women of Menopausal Age.,"Osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have long-term deleterious chronic effects and are among the most prevalent chronic disorders. DM and its associated factors, such as hyperglycemia, have a significant contribution to the pathophysiology of OA, particularly in post-menopausal women. Women who have uncontrolled diabetes (DM) are more prone to develop osteoarthritis (OA), which may be exacerbated by poor glycemic control. Furthermore, this category of female patients with DM has an increased risk of developing fractures, even in those with initially normal bone density scores, further illustrating the correlation between DM and bone health. Additionally, multiple risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, estrogen-based hormone therapy, and hyperuricemia, in menopausal women can lead to the development and exacerbation of OA. It is discovered that these variables have a direct or indirect impact, frequently causing inflammation and hormonal changes, which contribute to the intricate interaction between DM and OA. The management of OA and DM in women thus calls for a multi-faceted management plan including glycemic control, weight control, exercise, and specialized pain management methods catering to the specific requirements of the patients. Regularly screening for OA should be implemented for menopausal women with DM and utmost care should be provided by healthcare professionals. Regular monitoring of joint health and early management, encouraging interdisciplinary cooperation, putting preventative measures into place, and creating individualized treatment programs are essential. A thorough understanding of the link between DM and OA will ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and a better future for these individuals.",['Shukla R; Singh S; Kamath S; Shah U; Patel S; Kherajani K; Gupta A; Shaw P; Unnithan V; Kaithathara S; Gharde P'],2024,osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have long-term deleterious chronic effects. women with uncontrolled diabetes are more prone to develop osteoarthritis. this category of female patients with DM has an increased risk of developing fractures.
"The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among emergency medical services personnel in Saudi Red Crescent Authority, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Determining the prevalence of PTSD and contributing variables among (EMS) specialists was the goal of the current investigation. Furthermore, limited evidence exists regarding the application of PCL-5 for EMT practitioners, and the incidence of PTSD among different age groups and genders in Saudi Arabia. This cross-sectional descriptive study includes 211 prehospital care providers of the Saudi Red Crescent Authority stations in Riyadh. The randomization was done using Google Forms into subgroups according to participants' gender, years of experience, occupations, and average working hours. The presence and severity of PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) self-report questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson Chi-Square, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The reliability statistics were calculated using Cronbach's Alpha for the 20-survey questionnaire. The comparison of PCL-5 total scores indicated more PTSD symptomatology among females (1.61 + 0.799) as compared to male workers (1.13 + 0.642). The total score of PTSD demonstrated no statistically significant (P=0.79) differences between our age group classifications. In terms of the participants' city (Riyadh), the total PTSD score was less than the cutoff point which is 31. PTSD total score may not be affected by working experience as indicated by the non-significant difference in prevalence among EMT practitioners having <5 years, 5-10 years and above 10 years of working experience (P=0.215 with X2 = 3.076). PTSD incidence is affected by the type of occupation as statistically significant differences between groups (P=0.001) were recorded depending on the position and responsibilities of EMS practitioners. PTSD is also affected by average working hours per week, and there were statistically significant differences between groups (P=0.001). The total score of PTSD in the case of emergency service practitioners was found to be 33.7% among all the research participants, which may be regarded as a high prevalence when compared to the general population. Our investigations would contribute to a better understanding of the underlying factors of mental stress in EMS specialists in Saudi Arabia and to the development of adequate mental health practices.",['Alanazi SZ; Abusharha A; Afsar T; Trembley JH; Razak S'],2024,211 prehospital care providers of the saadh stations were recruited. the randomization was done using Google Forms into subgroups. the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the 20-item PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) self-report questionnaire.
Efficacy of Shenglin decoction in preventing acute severe lymphocytopenia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by maintenance therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors offers the best chance of cure for patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A significant challenge in this regimen is the occurrence of acute severe lymphopenia (ASL), which can compromise treatment efficacy. Currently, there are no effective strategies for preventing and treating ASL. Shenglin decoction (SLD), a traditional Chinese herbal medicine formulation, has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in mitigating ASL. However, robust evidence from clinical trials and a clear understanding of its mechanism of action are still needed. This study aims to comprehensively assess the efficacy, safety, and underlying mechanisms of SLD in the prevention of ASL. This prospective, dual-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial will enroll 140 stage III NSCLC patients. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a control group or an experimental group. Both groups will undergo definitive CCRT. Alongside the commencement of CCRT, the experimental group will receive an additional oral SLD intervention for a duration of three months. The primary outcome is the incidence rate of ASL, defined as the proportion of patients who experience at least one instance of a total lymphocyte count falling below 0.5 × 10^9 cells/L within 3 months of initiating CCRT treatment. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of fecal samples to assess gut microbiota, as well as metabolomic analysis of fecal/blood samples, will be conducted to explore potential mechanisms. This study protocol aims to rigorously evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLD, as well as elucidate its mechanism of action in preventing ASL. Successful outcomes could establish SLD as an evidence-based intervention for ASL prevention in NSCLC patients undergoing CCRT.

Heme-Mimetic Photosensitizer with Iron-Targeting and Internalizing Properties for Enhancing PDT Activity and Promoting Infected Diabetic Wound Healing.,"The management of multibacterial infections remains clinically challenging in the care and treatment of chronic diabetic wounds. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a promising approach to addressing bacterial infections. However, the limited target specificity and internalization properties of traditional photosensitizers (PSs) toward Gram-negative bacteria pose significant challenges to their antibacterial efficacy. In this study, we designed an iron heme-mimetic PS (MnO<sub>2</sub>@Fe-TCPP(Zn)) based on the iron dependence of bacteria that can be assimilated by bacteria and retained in different bacteria strains (<i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) and which shows high PDT antibacterial efficacy. For accelerated wound healing after antibacterial treatment, MnO<sub>2</sub>@Fe-TCPP(Zn) was loaded into a zwitterionic hydrogel with biocompatibility and antifouling properties to form a nanocomposite antibacterial hydrogel (PSB-MnO<sub>2</sub>@Fe-TCPP(Zn)). In the multibacterial infectious diabetic mouse wound model, the PSB-MnO<sub>2</sub>@Fe-TCPP(Zn) hydrogel dressing rapidly promoted skin regeneration by effectively inhibiting bacterial infections, eliminating inflammation, and promoting angiogenesis. This study provides an avenue for developing broad-spectrum antibacterial nanomaterials for combating the antibiotic resistance crisis and promoting the healing of complex bacterially infected wounds.",['Bao J; Mi J; Xia Y; Gui H; Jia H; Wang D; Luo H; Su L; Zhang J; Liu J; Liu J'],2024,photodynamic therapy (PDT) offers a promising approach to addressing bacterial infections. but the limited target specificity and internalization properties of traditional photosensitizers toward Gram-negative bacteria pose significant challenges to their antibacterial efficacy.
"""Survival patterns and prognostic factors of gingivobuccal complex squamous cell cancer: A monocentric retrospective chart audit"".","To analyze the impact of clinico-pathological prognostic factors on survival in patients with GBC OSCC. To evaluate the association between various clino-pathological and treatment factors influencing the 3-year and 5-year Overall survival (OS), and Disease specific survival (DSS) in patients with lower GBC OSCC. An Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC) approved retrospective chart audit was performed. Biopsy proven squamous cell cancer of gingivobuccal complex (GBC OSCC) patients from 2010 to 2019 who were treated primarily with surgery with or without adjuvant therapy having complete clinicopathological and follow up data were included. Survival outcomes including 2-year, 3-year & 5-year OS, and DSS were calculated and analyzed. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify significant predictor for the survival outcomes.

HIF2A mediates lineage transition to aggressive phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts in lung cancer brain metastasis.,"Brain metastasis is the most devasting form of lung cancer. Recent studies highlight significant differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) between lung cancer brain metastasis (LCBM) and primary lung cancer, which contribute significantly to tumor progression and drug resistance. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major component of pro-tumor TME with high plasticity. However, the lineage composition and function of CAFs in LCBM remain elusive. By reanalyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (GSE131907) from lung cancer patients with different stages of metastasis comprising primary lesions and brain metastasis, we found that CAFs undergo distinctive lineage transition during LCBM under a hypoxic situation, which is directly driven by hypoxia-induced HIF-2α activation. Transited CAFs enhance angiogenesis through VEGF pathways, trigger metabolic reprogramming, and promote the growth of tumor cells. Bulk RNA sequencing data was utilized as validation cohorts. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) assay was performed on four paired samples of brain metastasis and their primary lung cancer counterparts to validate the findings. Our study revealed a novel mechanism of lung cancer brain metastasis featuring HIF-2α-induced lineage transition and functional alteration of CAFs, which offers potential therapeutic targets.",['You M; Fu M; Shen Z; Feng Y; Zhang L; Zhu X; Zhuang Z; Mao Y; Hua W'],2024,brain metastasis is the most devasting form of lung cancer.

Extracellular vesicle-mediated drug delivery in breast cancer theranostics.,"Breast cancer (BC) continues to be a significant global challenge due to drug resistance and severe side effects. The increasing prevalence is alarming, requiring new therapeutic approaches to address these challenges. At this point, Extracellular vesicles (EVs), specifically small endosome-released nanometer-sized EVs (SEVs) or exosomes, have been explored by literature as potential theranostics. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the therapeutic potential of exosomes in BC, focusing on their advantages in drug delivery and their ability to mitigate metastasis. Following the review, we identified exosomes' potential in combination therapies, serving as miRNA carriers and contributing to improved anti-tumor effects. This is evident in clinical trials investigating exosomes in BC, which have shown their ability to boost chemotherapy efficacy by delivering drugs like paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin (DOX). However, the translation of EVs into BC therapy is hindered by various challenges. These challenges include the heterogeneity of EVs, the selection of the appropriate parent cell, the loading procedures, and determining the optimal administration routes. Despite the promising therapeutic potential of EVs, these obstacles must be addressed to realize their benefits in BC treatment.",['Abdul-Rahman T; Roy P; Herrera-Calderón RE; Khidri FF; Omotesho QA; Rumide TS; Fatima M; Roy S; Wireko AA; Atallah O; Roy S; Amekpor F; Ghosh S; Agyigra IA; Horbas V; Teslyk T; Bumeister V; Papadakis M; Alexiou A'],2024,extracellular vesicles (EVs) are specifically small endosome-released nanometer-sized EVs. this review aims to highlight the therapeutic potential of exosomes in BC. this focuses on their advantages in drug delivery and their ability to mitigate metastasis.
"Integrated analysis of blood DNA methylation, genetic variants, circulating proteins, microRNAs, and kidney failure in type 1 diabetes.","Variation in DNA methylation (DNAmet) in white blood cells and other cells/tissues has been implicated in the etiology of progressive diabetic kidney disease (DKD). However, the specific mechanisms linking DNAmet variation in blood cells with risk of kidney failure (KF) and utility of measuring blood cell DNAmet in personalized medicine are not clear. We measured blood cell DNAmet in 277 individuals with type 1 diabetes and DKD using Illumina EPIC arrays; 51% of the cohort developed KF during 7 to 20 years of follow-up. Our epigenome-wide analysis identified DNAmet at 17 CpGs (5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' loci) associated with risk of KF independent of major clinical risk factors. DNAmet at these KF-associated CpGs remained stable over a median period of 4.7 years. Furthermore, DNAmet variations at seven KF-associated CpGs were strongly associated with multiple genetic variants at seven genomic regions, suggesting a strong genetic influence on DNAmet. The effects of DNAmet variations at the KF-associated CpGs on risk of KF were partially mediated by multiple KF-associated circulating proteins and KF-associated circulating miRNAs. A prediction model for risk of KF was developed by adding blood cell DNAmet at eight selected KF-associated CpGs to the clinical model. This updated model significantly improved prediction performance (c-statistic = 0.93) versus the clinical model (c-statistic = 0.85) at <i>P</i> = 6.62 × 10<sup>-14</sup>. In conclusion, our multiomics study provides insights into mechanisms through which variation of DNAmet may affect KF development and shows that blood cell DNAmet at certain CpGs can improve risk prediction for KF in T1D.",['Chen Z; Satake E; Pezzolesi MG; Md Dom ZI; Stucki D; Kobayashi H; Syreeni A; Johnson AT; Wu X; Dahlström EH; King JB; Groop PH; Rich SS; Sandholm N; Krolewski AS; Natarajan R'],2024,genemet variation in blood cells has been implicated in the etiology of progressive diabetic kidney disease (DKD) 51% of the cohort developed KF during 7 to 20 years of follow-up.
Risk factors of periprosthetic joint infection after hemiarthroplasty for displaced femoral neck fracture in the elderly: Analysis of 1619 cases in the multicenter database.,"This multicenter retrospective study focuses on understanding the incidence, causative bacteria, and risk factors for Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) following hemiarthroplasty in elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures (FNF). From 2016 to 2020, 1,619 patients were diagnosed with displaced FNFs and treated surgically across 11 centers. After exclusions, 1,438 patients (399 men and 1,039 women) were included in the study, averaging 82.1 years in age and 20.2 kg/m² in BMI, observed over 25.7 months on average. Data on demographics, medical history, surgical details, and complications were described. PJI occurred in 20 of the 1438 patients (1.4%). The causative organism was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus in 6 patients and methicillin-resistant S. aureus in 6 patients. In patients' backgrounds, the average age was slightly higher in the non-PJI group (82.1 years) compared to the PJI group (80.4 years). There was a higher percentage of males in the PJI group (45%) than in the non-PJI group (27.5%). Drug history showed that the prevalence of anticoagulant use in the PJI group was 25%. Peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus were more prevalent in the PJI group. Most patients in both groups were independent in daily activities. The blood transfusion rate was significantly higher in the PJI group (50%) than in the non-PJI group (23.8%). Notably, the incidence of hematoma was higher in the PJI group (40%). This multicenter retrospective study demonstrates a low incidence (1.4%) of PJI in elderly patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty for FNF, primarily due to Staphylococcus aureus. Increased usage of antiplatelets and anticoagulants, as well as comorbidities related to atherosclerosis, like peripheral vascular disease and diabetes mellitus, were observed in patients with PJI. Additionally, these patients experienced higher rates of blood transfusion and postoperative hematomas, highlighting the need for careful management. It should be noted, however, that this finding is a conclusion limited by study design issues, including the retrospective design, small PJI sample size, and variability in treatment approaches.",['Sumi S; Takegami Y; Tokutake K; Nakashima H; Mishima K; Takatsu T; Imagama S'],2024,"a retrospective study focuses on the incidence, causative bacteria, and risk factors for PJI following hemiarthroplasty in elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures. from 2016 to 2020, 1,619 patients were diagnosed with displaced FNFs and treated surgically across 11 centers. data on demographics, medical history, surgical details, and complications were described."
Mechanoresponsive ETS1 causes endothelial dysfunction and arterialization in varicose veins via NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling.,"Varicose veins are the most common venous disorder in humans and are characterized by hemodynamic instability due to valvular insufficiency and orthostatic lifestyle factors. It is unclear how changes in biomechanical signals cause aberrant remodeling of the vein wall. Our previous studies suggest that Notch signaling is implicated in varicose vein arterialization. In the arterial system, mechanoresponsive ETS1 is a transcriptional activator of the endothelial Notch, but its involvement in sensing disrupted venous flow and varicose vein formation has not been investigated. Here, we use human varicose veins and cultured human venous endothelial cells to show that disturbed venous shear stress activates ETS1-NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling. Notch components were highly expressed in the neointima, whereas ETS1 was upregulated in all histological layers of varicose veins. In vitro microfluidic flow-based studies demonstrate that even minute changes in venous flow patterns enhance ETS1-NOTCH4/DLL4 signaling. Uniform venous shear stress, albeit an inherently low-flow system, does not induce ETS1 and Notch proteins. ETS1 activation under altered flow was mediated primarily by MEK1/2 and, to a lesser extent, by MEK5 but was independent of p38 MAP kinase. Endothelial cell-specific ETS1 knockdown prevented disturbed flow-induced NOTCH4/DLL4 expression. TK216, an inhibitor of ETS-family, prevented the acquisition of arterial molecular identity and loss of endothelial integrity in cells exposed to the ensuing altered shear stress. We conclude that ETS1 senses blood flow disturbances and may promote venous remodeling by inducing endothelial dysfunction. Targeting ETS1 rather than downstream Notch proteins could be an effective and safe strategy to develop varicose vein therapies.",['Sreelakshmi BJ; Karthika CL; Ahalya S; Kalpana SR; Kartha CC; Sumi S'],2024,varicose veins are the most common venous disorder in humans. it is unclear how changes in biomechanical signals cause aberrant remodeling of the vein wall.
"The influence of obesity, diabetes mellitus and smoking on fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD).","To detect environmental factors, which may be possible risk factors in the disease course of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Evaluation of patients with FECD registered in the FECD genetics database of the Center for Ophthalmology, University Hospital Cologne. For the evaluation, disease onset, central corneal thickness, best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA, logMAR), and modified Krachmer grading (grades 1-6) were correlated with the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), body mass index (BMI), and smoking behavior. To put the age-related increase in Krachmer grading into perspective, a correction of grading were formed. Depending on the variables studied, differences between groups were examined by Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test. The significance level was 5%. 403 patients with FECD were included in the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 70.0 ± 10.32 (range 28-96) years. The mean age at diagnosis of those patients was 63.1 ± 13.2 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.46:1. Patients with a BMI > 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> developed FECD significantly earlier than patients with a BMI < 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.001. Patients with DM showed significantly more often an Krachmer grade of 5, p = 0.015. Smoking had a negative effect on Krachmer grading (p = 0.024). Using the mediation analysis, the presence of DM correlated Krachmer Grade 5 (p = 0.015), and the presence of DM correlated with BMI > 30.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (p = 0.012). In addition to smoking and DM our study shows for the first time that obesity may have a negative impact on the development of FECD. Whether dietary interventions and hormones can influence the development or progression of the disease needs to be investigated in future studies.",['Zwingelberg SB; Lautwein B; Baar T; Heinzel-Gutenbrunner M; von Brandenstein M; Nobacht S; Matthaei M; Bachmann BO'],2024,"FECD patients with DM showed significantly more often an Krachmer grade of 5, p = 0.001. a correction of grading was formed."
"Telocytes: Detection, Visualization, Tissue Dissociation, and Tamoxifen-Induction of Transgenic Mice.","Telocytes, distinctive interstitial cells, have recently emerged as crucial components of the stem-cell niche in the intestine. Notably, telocytes are distinguished by their extremely long cellular protrusions extending hundreds of microns from the cell body, forming an interconnected network along the intestinal crypt villus axis. Due to these unique cellular characteristics, there is a need for tailored working protocols to effectively characterize and target telocytes. Here, we outline advanced and progressive protocols for tissue fixation, dissociation, visualization, and the use of tamoxifen-induced transgenic mouse models to specifically target telocytes.",['Canella M; Shoshkes-Carmel M'],2024,telocytes are distinctive interstitial cells. they are distinguished by their extremely long cellular protrusions. they form an interconnected network along the intestinal crypt villus axis.
Protocol to test for the formation of ternary protein complexes in vivo or in vitro using a two-step immunoprecipitation approach.,"Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) is an experimental technique to study protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, single-step coIP can only be used to identify the interaction between two proteins and does not solve the interaction testing of ternary complexes.

Effect of timed dosing of usual antihypertensives according to patient chronotype on cardiovascular outcomes: the Chronotype sub-study cohort of the Treatment in Morning versus Evening (TIME) study.,"Timing drug administration to endogenous circadian rhythms may enhance treatment efficacy. In the Chronotype sub-study of the Treatment in Morning versus Evening (TIME) clinical trial we examined whether timing of usual antihypertensive medications according to patient chronotype (a behavioural marker of personal circadian rhythm) may influence clinical cardiovascular outcomes. This was a cohort sub-study of TIME, a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, UK clinical trial of morning versus evening dosing of usual antihypertensive medications and cardiovascular outcomes. On August 3rd, 2020, all active TIME participants were invited to complete a validated chronotype questionnaire. Chronotype was quantitatively assessed as the mid sleep time on free days corrected for sleep debt on workdays (MSFsc). We analysed associations between chronotype and antihypertensive dosing time and explored their combined effect on cardiovascular outcomes (a composite endpoint of hospitalisation for non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or non-fatal stroke, and single components) using proportional hazard time-to-event models adjusted for baseline covariates. These were used to specifically test for interactions between dosing time and chronotype. Between August 3, 2020, and March 31, 2021, 5358 TIME participants completed the online questionnaire. 2778 were previously randomised to morning dosing and 2580 to evening dosing of their usual antihypertensives. Chronotype was symmetrically distributed around a median MSFsc of 3:07 am. The composite endpoint increased for later MSFsc (later chronotype) dosed in the morning but not in those dosed in the evening (hazard ratios 1.46 [95% CI 1.14-1.86] and 0.96 [95% CI 0.70-1.30] per hour of MSFsc, respectively; interaction p = 0.036). Later chronotype was associated with increased risk of hospitalisation for non-fatal MI in the morning dosing group, and reduced risk in the evening dosing group (hazard ratios 1.62 [95% CI 1.18-2.22] and 0.66 [95% CI 0.44-1.00] per hour of MSFsc, respectively; interaction p < 0.001). No interaction between chronotype and antihypertensive dosing time was observed for stroke events. Alignment of dosing time of usual antihypertensives with personal chronotype could lower the incidence of non-fatal MI compared to a 'misaligned' dosing time regimen. Future studies are warranted to establish whether synchronizing administration time of antihypertensive therapy with individual chronotype reduces risk of MI. The TIME study was funded by the British Heart Foundation (CS/14/1/30659) with support from the British and Irish Hypertension Society.",['Pigazzani F; Dyar KA; Morant SV; Vetter C; Rogers A; Flynn RWV; Rorie DA; Mackenzie IS; Cappuccio FP; Manfredini R; MacDonald TM'],2024,"a cohort sub-study of the treatment in Morning versus Evening (TIME) clinical trial examined whether timing of usual antihypertensive medications according to patient chronotype may influence clinical cardiovascular outcomes. on august 3rd, 2020, all active TIME participants were invited to complete a validated chronotype questionnaire."
Enhancing Infected Diabetic Wound Healing through Multifunctional Nanocomposite-Loaded Microneedle Patch: Inducing Multiple Regenerative Sites.,"Infected diabetic wound (DW) presents a prolonged and challenging healing process within the field of regenerative medicine. The effectiveness of conventional drug therapies is hindered by their limited ability to reach deep tissues and promote adequate wound healing rates. Therefore, there is an imperative to develop drug delivery systems that can penetrate deep tissues while exhibiting multifunctional properties to expedite wound healing. In this study, we devised a soluble microneedle (MN) patch made of γ-PGA, featuring multiple arrays, which was loaded with core-shell structured nanoparticles (NPs) known as Ag@MSN@CeO<sub>2</sub>, to enhance the healing of infected DWs. The NP comprises a CeO<sub>2</sub> core with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, a mesoporous silica NP (MSN) shell with angiogenic characteristics, and an outermost layer doped with Ag to combat bacterial infections. We demonstrated that the MN platform loaded with Ag@MSN@CeO<sub>2</sub> successfully penetrated deep tissues for effective drug delivery. These MN tips induced the formation of multiple regenerative sites at various points, leading to antibacterial, reactive oxygen species-lowering, macrophage ecological niche-regulating, vascular regeneration-promoting, and collagen deposition-promoting effects, thus significantly expediting the healing process of infected DWs. Considering these findings, the multifunctional MN@Ag@MSN@CeO<sub>2</sub> patch exhibits substantial potential for clinical applications in the treatment of infected DW.

Vasorin promotes endothelial differentiation of glioma stem cells via stimulating the transcription of VEGFR2.,"Gliomas are highly vascularized malignancies, but current anti-angiogenic treatments have not demonstrated practical improvements in patient survival. Studies have suggested that glioma-derived endothelial cell (GdEC) formed by glioma stem cell (GSC) differentiation may contribute to the failure of this treatment. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in GSC endothelial differentiation remain poorly understood. We previously reported that vasorin (VASN) is highly expressed in glioma and promotes angiogenesis. Here, we show that VASN expression positively correlates with GdEC signatures in glioma patients. VASN promotes the endothelial differentiation capacity of GSC in vitro and participates in the formation of GSC-derived vessels in vivo. Mechanistically, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is a critical factor that mediates the regulation of VASN on GSC endothelial differentiation. Separation of cell chromatin fractionation and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analysis show that VASN interacts with Notch1 and co-translocates into the cell nuclei, where VASN binds to the VEGFR2 gene promoter to stimulate its transcription during the progression of GSC differentiation into GdEC. Together, these findings elucidate the role and mechanisms of VASN in promoting the endothelial differentiation of GSC and suggest VASN as a potential target for anti-angiogenic therapy based on intervention in GdEC formation in gliomas.",['Qin Z; Zhong Y; Li P; Ma Z; Kang H; Huang Y; Zhong Y; Wang L'],2024,glioma-derived endothelial cell (GdEC) formed by glioma stem cell differentiation may contribute to the failure of this treatment. but molecular mechanisms involved in GSC endothelial differentiation remain poorly understood.
Catheter ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation: patterns of recurrence and impact on quality of life and health care utilisation.,"Patterns of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence post catheter ablation for persistent AF are not well described. This study aimed to describe the pattern of AF recurrence seen following catheter ablation for persistent AF (PsAF) and the implications for healthcare utilisation and quality of life. This was a post-hoc analysis of the CAPLA study, an international, multi-centre study that randomised patients with symptomatic PsAF to pulmonary vein isolation plus posterior wall isolation or pulmonary vein isolation alone. Patients underwent twice daily single lead ECG, implantable device monitoring or three monthly Holter monitoring. 154 of 333 (46.2%) patients (median age 67.3 years, 28% female) experienced AF recurrence at 12-month follow-up. Recurrence was paroxysmal in 97 (63%) patients and persistent in 57 (37%). Recurrence type did not differ between randomisation groups (p=0.508). Median AF burden was 27.4% in PsAF recurrence and 0.9% in paroxysmal AF (PAF) recurrence (p<0.001). Patients with PsAF recurrence had lower baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (PsAF 50% vs PAF 60%, p<0.001) and larger left atrial volume (PsAF 54.2±19.3 ml/m² vs PAF 44.8±11.6 ml/m², p=0.008). Healthcare utilisation was significantly higher in PsAF (45 patients [78.9%]) vs PAF recurrence (45 patients [46.4%], p<0.001) and lowest in those without recurrence (17 patients [9.5%], p<0.001). Patients without AF recurrence had greater improvements in quality of life as assessed by the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT) questionnaire (Δ33.3±25.2 points) compared to those with PAF (Δ24.0±25.0 points, p=0.012) or PsAF (Δ13.4±22.9 points, p<0.001) recurrence. AF recurrence is more often paroxysmal after catheter ablation for PsAF irrespective of ablation strategy. Recurrent PsAF was associated with higher AF burden, increased healthcare utilisation and antiarrhythmic drug use. The type of AF recurrence and AF burden may be considered important endpoints in clinical trials investigating ablation of PsAF.",['Crowley R; Chieng D; Sugumar H; Ling LH; Segan L; William J; Prabhu S; Voskoboinik A; Wong G; Morton JB; Lee G; McLellan AJ; Wong M; Pathak RK; Sterns L; Ginks M; Sanders P; Kalman JM; Kistler PM'],2024,154 of 333 (46.2%) patients experienced AF recurrence at 12-month follow-up. a post-hoc analysis of the CAPLA study aimed to describe the pattern of AF recurrence seen following catheter ablation for persistent AF.

Analysis of causes and prognostic impact of tube occlusion during hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei.,"Appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), a rare tumor from mucinous appendiceal origins, is treated with Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC). However, tubing blockages during HIPEC treatment pose a common challenge, impeding the smooth progression of therapy. Few studies to date have explored the incidence and risk factors of tube occlusion during HIPEC in patients with appendiceal PMP, as well as its adverse impact on postoperative complications. From October 2017 to June 2023, a total of 80 patients with appendiceal PMP undergoing combined CRS and HIPEC were included in this study. Tubing blockage events were strictly defined, with patients experiencing blockages during HIPEC treatment allocated to the study group, while those with unobstructed perfusion were assigned to the control group. A comparative analysis was conducted between the two groups regarding post-HIPEC health assessments and occurrence of complications. Risk factors for luminal occlusion during closed HIPEC procedures were identified through univariate and multivariate analysis of data from 303 HIPEC treatments. Tubing blockages occurred in 41 patients (51.3%). The study group experienced prolonged gastrointestinal decompression time (4.1 ± 3.0 vs. 2.5 ± 1.7 days, P = 0.003) and prolonged time to bowel movement (6.1 ± 2.3 vs. 5.1 ± 1.8 days, P = 0.022) compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups. The 1-year survival rate postoperatively was 97%, and the 3-year survival rate was 81%, with no association found between tubing blockage and poorer survival. Additionally, In 303 instances of HIPEC treatment among these 80 patients, tube occlusion occurred in 89 cases (89/303, 29.4%). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed age, diabetes, hypertension, and pathology as independent risk factors for tube occlusion. Tubing blockages are a common occurrence during HIPEC treatment, leading to prolonged postoperative gastrointestinal functional recovery time. When patients are elderly and have concomitant hypertension and diabetes, along with a histological type of low-grade mucinous tumor, the risk of tube occlusion increases. However, this study did not find a significant correlation between tubing blockage and the incidence of postoperative complications or overall patient survival.",['Liu Q; Jiao J; Li C; Chen Y; Wang B; Shi J; Yu G'],2024,appendiceal pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is treated with Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) tubing blockages during HIPEC treatment pose a common challenge.
Cancer Treatment Before and After Physician-Pharmacy Integration.,"Integration of pharmacies with physician practices, also known as medically integrated dispensing, is increasing in oncology. However, little is known about how this integration affects drug use, expenditures, medication adherence, or time to treatment initiation. To examine the association of physician-pharmacy integration with oral oncology drug expenditures, use, and patient-centered measures. This cohort study used claims data from a large commercial insurer in the US to analyze changes in outcome measures among patients treated by pharmacy-integrating vs nonintegrating community oncologists in 14 states between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019. Commercially insured patients were aged 18 to 64 years with 1 of the following advanced-stage diagnoses: breast cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, or prostate cancer. Data analysis was conducted from May 2023 to March 2024. Treatment by a pharmacy-integrating oncologist, ascertained by the presence of an on-site pharmacy or nonpharmacy dispensing site. Oral, intravenous (IV), total, and out-of-pocket drug expenditures for a 6-month episode of care; share of patients prescribed oral drugs; days' supply of oral drugs; medication adherence measured by proportion of days covered; and time to treatment initiation. The association between an oncologist's pharmacy integration and each outcome of interest was estimated using the difference-in-differences estimator. Between 2012 and 2019, 3159 oncologists (745 females [27.1%], 2002 males [72.9%]) treated 23 968 patients (66.4% female; 53.4% aged 55-64 years). Of the 3159 oncologists, 578 (18.3%) worked in practices that integrated with pharmacies (with a low rate in 2011 of 0% and a high rate in 2019 of 31.5%). In the full sample (including all cancer sites), after physician-pharmacy integration, no significant changes were found in oral drug expenditures, IV drug expenditures, or total drug expenditures. There was, however, an increase in days' supply of oral drugs (5.96 days; 95% CI, 0.64-11.28 days; P = .001). There were no significant changes in out-of-pocket expenditures, medication adherence, or time to treatment initiation of oral drugs. In the breast cancer sample, there was an increase in oral drug expenditures ($244; 95% CI, $41-$446; P = .02) and a decrease in IV drug expenditures (-$4187; 95% CI, -$8293 to -$80; P = .05).

Cost-effectiveness analysis of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab compared with sorafenib as first-line treatment in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in Singapore.,"This study aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab against sorafenib for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Singapore. A partitioned survival model was developed from a healthcare system perspective, with a 10-year lifetime horizon. Clinical inputs and utilities were obtained from the IMbrave150 trial. Healthcare resource use costs were obtained from published local sources; drug costs reflected the most recent public hospital selling prices. Outcomes included life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the model's robustness. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab offered an additional 1.42 life years and 1.09 QALYs, with an additional cost of S$111,847; the ICER was S$102,988/QALY.

Protein carbonylation causes sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload by increasing intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> level in ventricular myocytes.,"Diabetes is commonly associated with an elevated level of reactive carbonyl species due to alteration of glucose and fatty acid metabolism. These metabolic changes cause an abnormality in cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation that can lead to cardiomyopathies. In this study, we explored how the reactive α-dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) affects Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in mouse ventricular myocytes. Analysis of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics revealed that MGO (200 μM) increases action potential (AP)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, with a limited effect on L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and SERCA-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. At the same time, MGO significantly slowed down cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX). MGO also increased the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves during rest and these Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events were abolished by an external solution with zero [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Adrenergic receptor activation with isoproterenol (10 nM) increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, but it also triggered spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in 27% of studied cells. Pretreatment of myocytes with MGO increased the fraction of cells with Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves during adrenergic receptor stimulation by 163%. Measurements of intracellular [Na<sup>+</sup>] revealed that MGO increases cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] by 57% from the maximal effect produced by the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor ouabain (20 μM). This increase in cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] was a result of activation of a tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> influx, but not an inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. An increase in cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] after treating cells with ouabain produced similar effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation as MGO. These results suggest that protein carbonylation can affect cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation by increasing cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] via a tetrodotoxin-sensitive pathway. This, in turn, reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> extrusion by NCX, causing SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves.",['Bovo E; Seflova J; Robia SL; Zima AV'],2024,reactive -dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) affects Casup>2+/sup> regulation in mouse ventricular myocytes. a limited effect on AP-induced Casup>2+/sup> transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Casup>2+/sup> load.
Geographic diversity in chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention: insights from the PROGRESS-CTO registry.,"There is variability in clinical and lesion characteristics as well as techniques in chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We analyzed patient and lesion characteristics, techniques, and outcomes in 11 503 CTO-PCI procedures performed in North America (NA) and in the combined regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa from 2017 to 2023 as documented in the PROGRESS-CTO registry. Eight thousand four hundred seventy-nine (74%) procedures were performed in NA. Compared with non-NA patients, NA patients were older, with higher body mass index and higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, family history of coronary artery disease, prior history of PCI, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Their CTOs were more complex, with higher J-CTO (2.56 ± 1.22 vs 1.81 ± 1.24; P less than .001) and PROGRESS-CTO (1.29 ± 1.01 vs 1.07 ± 0.95; P less than .001) scores, longer length, and higher prevalence of proximal cap ambiguity, blunt/no stump, moderate to severe calcification, and proximal tortuosity. Retrograde (31.0% vs 22.1%; P less than .001) and antegrade dissection and re-entry (ADR) (21.2% vs 9.2%; P less than .001) were more commonly used in NA centers, along with intravascular ultrasound (69.0% vs 10.1%; P less than .001). Procedure and fluoroscopy times were longer in NA, while contrast volume and radiation dose were lower. Technical (86.7% vs 86.8%; P > .90) and procedural (85.4% vs 85.8%; P = .70) success and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (1.9% vs 1.7%; P = .40) were similar in NA and non-NA centers.

Analysis of admixed Greenlandic siblings shows that the mean genotypic values for metabolic phenotypes differ between Inuit and Europeans.,"Disease prevalence and mean phenotype values differ between many populations, including Inuit and Europeans. Whether these differences are partly explained by genetic differences or solely due to differences in environmental exposures is still unknown, because estimates of the genetic contribution to these means, which we will here refer to as mean genotypic values, are easily confounded, and because studies across genetically diverse populations are lacking. Leveraging the unique genetic properties of the small, admixed and historically isolated Greenlandic population, we estimated the differences in mean genotypic value between Inuit and European genetic ancestry using an admixed sibling design. Analyses were performed across 26 metabolic phenotypes, in 1474 admixed sibling pairs present in a cohort of 5996 Greenlanders. After FDR correction for multiple testing, we found significantly lower mean genotypic values in Inuit genetic ancestry compared to European genetic ancestry for body weight (effect size per percentage of Inuit genetic ancestry (se), -0.51 (0.16) kg/%), body mass index (-0.20 (0.06) kg/m<sup>2</sup>/%), fat percentage (-0.38 (0.13) %/%), waist circumference (-0.42 (0.16) cm/%), hip circumference (-0.38 (0.11) cm/%) and fasting serum insulin levels (-1.07 (0.51) pmol/l/%). The direction of the effects was consistent with the observed mean phenotype differences between Inuit and European genetic ancestry. No difference in mean genotypic value was observed for height, markers of glucose homeostasis, or circulating lipid levels. We show that mean genotypic values for some metabolic phenotypes differ between two human populations using a method not easily confounded by possible differences in environmental exposures.

Automated Artificial Intelligence-Based Thai Food Dietary Assessment System: Development and Validation.,"Dietary assessment is a fundamental component of nutrition research and plays a pivotal role in managing chronic diseases. Traditional dietary assessment methods, particularly in the context of Thai cuisine, often require extensive training and may lead to estimation errors. To address these challenges, Institute of Nutrition, Mahidol University (INMU) iFood, an innovative artificial intelligence-based Thai food dietary assessment system, allows for estimating the nutritive values of dishes from food images. INMU iFood leverages state-of-the-art technology and integrates a validated automated Thai food analysis system. Users can use 3 distinct input methods: food image recognition, manual input, and a convenient barcode scanner. This versatility simplifies the tracking of dietary intake while maximizing data quality at the individual level. The core improvement in INMU iFood can be attributed to 2 key factors, namely, the replacement of Yolov4-tiny with Yolov7 and the expansion of noncarbohydrate source foods in the training image data set. This combination significantly enhances the system's ability to identify food items, especially in scenarios with closely packed food images, thus improving accuracy.

Regulatory patterns of Chinese patent medicine for lipid metabolism disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by ischemic stroke: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"To investigate the regulatory patterns of Chinese patent medicine (CPM) interventions on lipid metabolism disorders in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) complicated by ischemic stroke. Two researchers independently searched 8 major databases and created a comprehensive database containing all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the application of ""blood-activating and stasis-removing"" CPM in the treatment of stroke combined with T2DM until October 1, 2022. The collected data were compiled and organized in Excel. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane 5.3 bias risk assessment tool, and the network meta-analysis was conducted using R software. A total of 12 articles were included in the final analysis, covering 4 types of CPM: Naoxintong Capsules (NXT), Tongmai Jiangtang Capsules, Tongxinluo Capsules (TXL), and Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules. Among these, CPM formulations containing herbs with blood-activating and stasis-removing properties were the most commonly used. The results of the network meta-analysis are as follows: (1) the combination of 3 CPM formulations showed superior efficacy in improving total cholesterol levels compared to conventional Western medicine treatment (CT). In particular, Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules + CT (surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA] = 97.24%) demonstrated the highest efficacy, followed by NXT + CT (SUCRA = 66.23%), and then TXL + CT (SUCRA = 55.16%). (2) TXL + CT treatment exhibited the most promising efficacy in improving triglyceride levels (P < .05), while the effects of the other 3 CPM formulations were not statistically significant. (3) In terms of improving low-density lipoprotein levels, NXT + CT (SUCRA = 82.27%) showed better efficacy than TXL + CT (SUCRA = 73.99%), while the effects of the other 2 CPM formulations were not statistically significant. (4) The combination of CPM formulations and CT resulted in a lower incidence of adverse reactions compared to CT (P < .05). The treatment of patients with T2DM complicated by ischemic stroke commonly involved the use of ""blood-activating and stasis-removing"" herbal medicines. These herbal medicines have shown effectiveness in regulating patients' blood lipid levels. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the analysis was influenced by variations in the number and quality of RCTs involving different CPM formulations. Therefore, additional validation through large-scale, high-quality RCT studies is required.",['Lu Z; Zhang X; Xie Y'],2024,two researchers independently searched 8 major databases. they created a database containing all randomized controlled trials. the data were compiled and organized in Excel.
Mapping medically relevant RNA isoform diversity in the aged human frontal cortex with deep long-read RNA-seq.,"Determining whether the RNA isoforms from medically relevant genes have distinct functions could facilitate direct targeting of RNA isoforms for disease treatment. Here, as a step toward this goal for neurological diseases, we sequenced 12 postmortem, aged human frontal cortices (6 Alzheimer disease cases and 6 controls; 50% female) using one Oxford Nanopore PromethION flow cell per sample. We identified 1,917 medically relevant genes expressing multiple isoforms in the frontal cortex where 1,018 had multiple isoforms with different protein-coding sequences. Of these 1,018 genes, 57 are implicated in brain-related diseases including major depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer disease. Our study also uncovered 53 new RNA isoforms in medically relevant genes, including several where the new isoform was one of the most highly expressed for that gene. We also reported on five mitochondrially encoded, spliced RNA isoforms. We found 99 differentially expressed RNA isoforms between cases with Alzheimer disease and controls.",['Aguzzoli Heberle B; Brandon JA; Page ML; Nations KA; Dikobe KI; White BJ; Gordon LA; Fox GA; Wadsworth ME; Doyle PH; Williams BA; Fox EJ; Shantaraman A; Ryten M; Goodwin S; Ghiban E; Wappel R; Mavruk-Eskipehlivan S; Miller JB; Seyfried NT; Nelson PT; Fryer JD; Ebbert MTW'],2024,"RNA isoforms from medically relevant genes have distinct functions. we sequenced 12 postmortem, aged human frontal cortices. 57 of these genes are implicated in brain-related diseases."
Evaluation of DFT methods for predicting geometries and NMR spectra of Bi(III) dithiocarbamate complexes with antitumor properties.,"Bismuth complexes with dithiocarbamate ligands have attracted attention because of their biological applications, such as antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and anticancer properties. These complexes have high cytotoxic activity against cancer cells, being more active than the standard drugs cisplatin, doxorubicin, and tamoxifen. In the present study, we investigated the ability of some DFT methods to reproduce the geometries and NMR spectra of the Bi(III) dithiocarbamate complexes, selected based on their proven antitumor activity. Our investigation revealed that the M06-L/def2-TZVP/ECP/CPCM method presented good accuracy in predicting geometries, while the TPSSh/def2-SVP/ECP/CPCM method proved effective in analyzing the <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of these molecules. In general, all examined methods exhibited comparable performance in predicting <sup>1</sup>H NMR signals. Calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program using the def2-SVP and def2-TZVP basis sets, employing relativistic effective core potential (ECP) for Bi and using the CPCM solvent model. The exchange-correlation functionals BP86, PBE, OLYP, M06-L, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, M06-2X, TPSSh, CAM-B3LYP, and ωB97XD were used in the study.

Comparison of four criteria for potentially inappropriate medications in older patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer.,"Potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) use is a common problem among older patients. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of PIMs in older patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to identify the correlates of PIMs. A secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study was conducted. Patients were enrolled from January 2014 to December 2020 and information were extracted from patients' electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated the PIMs using four different PIM criteria. The concordance among the four PIM criteria was calculated using kappa tests. The possible risk factors associated with PIMs were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. The prevalence of at least one PIM identified by the four criteria ranged from 25.1% to 48.2% among 514 patients. There was moderate consistency between the GO-PIM scale and the AGS/Beers criteria, while poor consistency with the other criteria (the STOPP criteria and the Chinese criteria). Polypharmacy was found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of PIMs in all criteria (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Our results showed a high prevalence of PIMs in older patients with NSCLC, which was significantly associated with polypharmacy, and the consistency across the four criteria was poor-to-moderate.",['Xu M; Ma Z; Feng X; An Z'],2024,prospective cohort study aimed to compare prevalence of PIMs in older patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer. the prevalence of at least one PIM identified by the four criteria ranged from 25.1% to 48.2% among 514 patients.
Green synthesis of silver nanoparticle prepared with Ocimum species and assessment of anticancer potential.,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have gained much attention due to their unique physical, and chemical properties. Integration of phytochemicals in nanoformulation might have higher applicability in healthcare. Current work demonstrates the synthesis of green AgNPs with O. gratissimum (gr-AgNPs) O. tenuiflorum (te-AgNPs) and O. americanum (am-AgNPs) followed by an evaluation of their antimicrobial and anticancer properties. SEM analysis revealed spherical-shaped particles with average particle sizes of 69.0 ± 5 nm for te-AgNPs, 46.9 ± 9 nm for gr-AgNPs, and 58.5 ± 18.7 nm for am-AgNPs with a polydispersity index below 0.4. The synthesized am-AgNPs effectively inhibited Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans with 23 ± 1.58 mm, 20 ± 1.68 mm, 22 ± 1.80 mm, 26 ± 1.85 mm, and 22 ± 1.40 nm of zone of inhibition respectively. Synthesized AgNPs also induced apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 in concentration-dependent manner. IC<sub>50</sub> values for am-AgNPs, te-AgNPs, and gr-AgNPs were 14.78 ± 0.89 µg, 18.04 ± 0.63 and 15.41 ± 0.37 µg respectively which suggested that am-AgNPs were the most effective against cancer. At higher dose size (20 µg) AgNPs were equally effective to commercial standard Doxorubicin (DOX). In comparison to te-AgNPs and gr-AgNPs, am-AgNPs have higher in vitro anticancer and antimicrobial effects. The work reported Ocimum americanum for its anticancer properties with chemical profile (GCMS) and compared it with earlier reported species. The activity against microbial pathogens and selected cancer cells clearly depicted that these species have distinct variations in activity.

The efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) as a complementary in colorectal cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in developed countries. Therefore, omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) have been suggested as a beneficial complementary treatment due to their ability to regulate inflammatory responses and improve nutrition levels.This study aimed to evaluate the effects of O3FAs as a complementary treatment for inflammation, nutrition levels, post-operative infectious complications, and enhancement of recovery in CRC patients. The literature search was carried out through three databases. The outcomes of interest were assessed by measuring pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and CRP levels, serum albumin levels for nutrition assessment, post-operative infectious complications, and length of stay for recovery evaluation. Quality appraisal and meta-analysis were performed using RoB 2.0 and RevMan 5.4, respectively. The result showed that O3FAs significantly reduced IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α, but did not affect IL-1β. Furthermore, the variable slightly increased serum albumin levels and the supplementation led to a decrease in post-operative infectious complications and shortened hospital stays. O3FAs as a complementary treatment provided advantages for CRC patients, Further clinical trials and experiments should also be made emphasizing the impact and clinical implementation of O3FA in the nutritional status of CRC patients.",['Wibowo AA; Willyanto NA'],2024,omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) have been suggested as a complementary treatment. they regulate inflammatory responses and improve nutrition levels. results of interest were assessed by measuring pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Multiomics profiling reveals VDR as a central regulator of mesenchymal stem cell senescence with a known association with osteoporosis after high-fat diet exposure.,"The consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) has been linked to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fragility fractures. However, the specific mechanisms of HFD-induced osteoporosis are not fully understood. Our study shows that exposure to an HFD induces premature senescence in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), diminishing their proliferation and osteogenic capability, and thereby contributes to osteoporosis. Transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility analyses revealed the decreased chromatin accessibility of vitamin D receptor (VDR)-binding sequences and decreased VDR signaling in BMSCs from HFD-fed mice, suggesting that VDR is a key regulator of BMSC senescence. Notably, the administration of a VDR activator to HFD-fed mice rescued BMSC senescence and significantly improved osteogenesis, bone mass, and other bone parameters. Mechanistically, VDR activation reduced BMSC senescence by decreasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and preserving mitochondrial function. Our findings not only elucidate the mechanisms by which an HFD induces BMSC senescence and associated osteoporosis but also offer new insights into treating HFD-induced osteoporosis by targeting the VDR-superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-ROS axis.",['Chen J; Kuang S; Cen J; Zhang Y; Shen Z; Qin W; Huang Q; Wang Z; Gao X; Huang F; Lin Z'],2024,exposure to an HFD induces premature senescence in bone marrow stem cells. increased chromatin accessibility of vitamin D receptor-binding sequences. increased VDR signaling in BMSCs from HFD-fed mice.
FRZB: a potential prognostic marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with approximately 600,000 new cases each year. A small number of HNSCCs are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Frizzled related protein (FRZB) has been reported in many inflammatory diseases and cancers, but it is yet unclear how FRZB affects HNSCC, as well as its role and underlying mechanism. TIMER2 database was utilized to evaluate FRZB expression in cancer tissues, and FRZB expression in HNSCC tissues was confirmed by samples obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. To identify whether FRZB could be used as a prognostic predictor, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. FRZB co-expression profile was explored using the LinkedOmics database, then Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were performed for these FRZB-related genes in HNSCC samples. Lasso regression analysis was subsequently used to screen for prognostic variables, and we determined the infiltration of immune cells in HNSCC patients to clarify the influence of FRZB on tumor immune microenvironment. At last, we assessed the association between FRZB expression and immune checkpoint gene, and compared the sensitivity of common chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we found that FRZB was dysregulated in HNSCC tumor tissues and had a relationship with clinical parameters. The reliability and independence of FRZB as a factor in determining a patient's prognosis for HNSCC was also established. Additional investigation revealed that FRZB was linked to common immune checkpoint genes and may be implicated in immune infiltration.",['Li Y; Gu F; Huang X; Huang W; Xiang J; Yue J; Wang Y; Chen R'],2024,a small number of squamous cell carcinomas are caused by human papillomavirus infection.

Polycythemia Vera Masked by Megaloblastic Anemia.,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by uncontrolled red blood cell production. Megaloblastic anemia is caused by deficiency of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and/or folate (vitamin B9). While B12 deficiency may be caused by insufficient dietary intake or impairment of its utilization, its association with PV is described without exact knowledge of the physiopathology. We herein report the occurrence of megaloblastic anemia due to Vitamin B12 deficiency in an 85-year-old North African woman patient with PV.

"White light powered antimicrobial nanoagents for triple photothermal, chemodynamic and photodynamic based sterilization.","Antibacterial nanoagents have been increasingly developed due to their favorable biocompatibility, cost-effective raw materials, and alternative chemical or optical properties. Nevertheless, there is still a pressing need for antibacterial nanoagents that exhibit outstanding bacteria-binding capabilities and high antibacterial efficiency. In this study, we constructed a multifunctional cascade bioreactor (GCDCO) as a novel antibacterial agent. This involved incorporating carbon dots (CDs), cobalt sulfide quantum dots (CoS<sub><i>x</i></sub> QDs), and glucose oxidase (GOx) to enhance bacterial inhibition under sunlight irradiation. The GCDCO demonstrated highly efficient antibacterial capabilities attributed to its favorable photothermal properties, photodynamic activity, as well as the synergistic effects of hyperthermia, glucose-augmented chemodynamic action, and additional photodynamic activity. Within this cascade bioreactor, CDs played the role of a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT), capable of generating ˙O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> even under solar light irradiation. The CoS<sub><i>x</i></sub> QDs not only functioned as a catalytic component to decompose hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and generate hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), but they also served as heat generators to enhance the Fenton-like catalysis process. Furthermore, GOx was incorporated into this cascade bioreactor to internally supply H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by consuming glucose for a Fenton-like reaction. As a result, GCDCO could generate a substantial amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to a significant synergistic effect that greatly induced bacterial death. Furthermore, the <i>in vitro</i> antibacterial experiment revealed that GCDCO displayed notably enhanced antibacterial activity against <i>E. coli</i> (99+ %) when combined with glucose under simulated sunlight, surpassing the efficacy of the individual components. This underscores its remarkable efficiency in combating bacterial growth. Taken together, our GCDCO demonstrates significant potential for use in the routine treatment of skin infections among diabetic patients.",['Tian H; Zhu H; Xue Y; Wang M; Xing K; Li Z; Loh XJ; Ye E; Ding X; Li BL; Yin X; Leong DT'],2024,"antibacterial nanoagents have been increasingly developed due to their favorable biocompatibility, cost-effective raw materials, and alternative chemical or optical properties. the gCDCO demonstrated highly efficient antibacterial capabilities attributed to its favorable photothermal properties, photodynamic activity, and additional photodynamic activity."
Neutrophils in glioma microenvironment: from immune function to immunotherapy.,"Glioma is a malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Currently, effective treatment options for gliomas are still lacking. Neutrophils, as an important member of the tumor microenvironment (TME), are widely distributed in circulation. Recently, the discovery of cranial-meningeal channels and intracranial lymphatic vessels has provided new insights into the origins of neutrophils in the CNS. Neutrophils in the brain may originate more from the skull and adjacent vertebral bone marrow. They cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under the action of chemokines and enter the brain parenchyma, subsequently migrating to the glioma TME and undergoing phenotypic changes upon contact with tumor cells. Under glycolytic metabolism model, neutrophils show complex and dual functions in different stages of cancer progression, including participation in the malignant progression, immune suppression, and anti-tumor effects of gliomas. Additionally, neutrophils in the TME interact with other immune cells, playing a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy. Targeting neutrophils may be a novel generation of immunotherapy and improve the efficacy of cancer treatments. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms of neutrophils infiltrating the central nervous system from the external environment, detailing the origin, functions, classifications, and targeted therapies of neutrophils in the context of glioma.",['Sun C; Wang S; Ma Z; Zhou J; Ding Z; Yuan G; Pan Y'],2024,glioma is a malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). effective treatment options for gliomas are still lacking.
"Molecular Generation, QSAR, and Molecular Dynamic Simulation Studies for Virtual Screening of DNA Polymerase Theta Inhibitors.","The machine learning-based QSAR modeling procedure, molecular generations, and molecular dynamic simulations were applied to virtually screen the DNA polymerase theta inhibitors. The DNA polymerase theta (Polθ or POLQ) is an attractive target for treatments of homologous recombination deficient (such as BRCA deficient) cancers. There are no approved drugs for targeting POLQ, and only one inhibitor is in Phase Ⅱclinical trials; thus, it is necessary to develop novel POLQ inhibitors. To build machine learning models that predict the bioactivities of POLQ inhibitors. To build molecular generation models that generate diverse molecules. To virtually screen the generated molecules by the machine learning models. To analyze the binding modes of the screening results by molecular dynamic simulations. In the present work, 325 inhibitors with POLQ polymerase domain bioactivities were Collected. Two machine learning methods, random forest and deep neural network, were used for building the ligand- and structure-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. The substructure replacement-based method and transfer learning-based deep recurrent neural network method were used for molecular generations. Molecular docking and consensus QSAR models were carried out for virtual screening. The molecular dynamic simulations and MM/GBSA binding free energy calculation and decomposition were used to further analyze the screening results. The MCC values of the best ligand- and structure-based consensus QSAR models reached 0.651 and 0.361 for the test set, respectively. The machine learning-based docking scores had better-predicted ability to distinguish the highly and weakly active poses than the original docking scores. The 96490 molecules were generated by both molecular generation methods, and 10 molecules were retained by virtual screening. Four favorable interactions were concluded by molecular dynamic simulations. We hope that the screening results and the binding modes are helpful for designing the highly active POLQ polymerase inhibitors and the models of the molecular design workflow can be used as reliable tools for drug design.",['Qin Z; Liu L; Gao M; Feng W; Huang C; Liu W'],2024,"the DNA polymerase theta is an attractive target for treatments of homologous recombination deficient (such as BRCA deficient) cancers. there are no approved drugs for targeting POLQ, and only one inhibitor is in Phase IIclinical trials. to build molecular generation models that predict the bioactivities of POLQ inhibitors."
Effects of Age and Sex on Systemic Inflammation and Cardiometabolic Function in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"Systemic inflammation, aging, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) all contribute to the development of cardiovascular dysfunction and impaired aerobic exercise capacity but their interplay remains unclear. This study evaluates the impact of age, sex, and inflammation on coronary and peripheral vascular function and exercise capacity in elderly individuals with and without type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Elderly individuals (age ≥65 years) underwent biochemical and tissue inflammatory phenotyping, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, and vascular reactivity testing. Correlation and regression analyses determined the effects of systemic inflammation, older age, and sex on cardiovascular health, stratified by T2DM status. For the 133 recruited individuals (44% female; median age 71, IQR=7 years, 41% with T2DM) the presence of T2DM did not have an effect on most blood serum inflammatory markers and skin biopsies. Hyperemic myocardial blood flow (hMBF), flow-mediated, and flow-independent nitroglycerin induced brachial artery dilation were significantly impaired in males, but not females with T2DM. Peak VO2 was lower with T2DM (p=0.022), mostly because of the effect of T2DM in females. Females showed more adverse myocardial remodeling assessed by extracellular volume (p=0.008), independent of T2DM status. Our findings suggest that the pathophysiological manifestations of T2DM on vascular function and aerobic exercise capacity are distinct in elderly males and females and this may reflect underlying differences in vascular and myocardial aging in the presence of T2DM.",['Dushay J; Rickers ES; Wang E; Gilman J; Zhang Y; Blankstein R; Gervino EV; Jerosch-Herold M; Veves A'],2024,"age, sex, and inflammation contribute to the development of cardiovascular dysfunction. older individuals underwent biochemical and tissue inflammatory phenotyping. correlation and regression analyses determined the effects of systemic inflammation, older age, and sex on cardiovascular health."
A cost comparison of pembrolizumab: Fixed and weight-based dosing.,"Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, indicated to treat multiple cancers, was initially approved in Australia as weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Subsequent approvals used 'fixed' dosages of 200 mg Q3W or 400 mg every 6 weeks (Q6W). Pharmacokinetic equivalence was demonstrated between dosing strategies, with no significant differences in efficacy or toxicity. Fixed dosing regimens are routinely used in Australia. To model and compare the cost of weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab to standard fixed dosing regimens. A single centre, retrospective review was conducted. Patients, identified from dispensing software, who commenced on pembrolizumab between January and December 2022 were included. Patient demographic and treatment data was extracted from electronic medical records. Costs of weight-based doses were calculated and compared to the cost of fixed dosing. Variables such as acquisition cost, funding mechanisms and 'vial sharing' were considered. Fifty-two patients were included (63% male, median age 68 years). Of the 211 doses of pembrolizumab administered (average 4.1 doses/patient), 161 were Q3W doses, and 50 were Q6W doses. The acquisition cost for a fixed 200 mg and 400 mg dose was $7646, and $15,292, respectively. The average patient weight was 77.6 kg (SD 19 kg), which equated to $5933 for a weight-based Q3W dose, and $11,867 for the Q6W dose; a potential cost avoidance of $1965 and $3930 per dose, respectively. This represented a possible 23.5% avoidance in medication acquisition cost. Over the study period of 1 year, using weight-based dosing for pembrolizumab had the potential to reduce medication expenditure by $467,996. Significant cost avoidance could be achieved via weight-based pembrolizumab dosing. Given the substantial total cost of pembrolizumab, the growing number of indications and the expected equivalent treatment outcomes with weight-based pembrolizumab, the potential cost reductions of weight-based pembrolizumab at both institution and government level should be further explored.",['Slee AL; Coutsouvelis J; Tong B; Poole S; Zalcberg J'],2024,"pembrolizumab was approved as weight-based dosing at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.

A Comparison of Wound Complications Following Total Hip Arthroplasty Performed Through the Direct Anterior Versus Direct Lateral Approach.,"Some studies have suggested the risk of wound complications may be higher using the direct anterior (DA) approach to total hip arthroplasty (THA). This study aimed to compare the risk of early postoperative wound complications between the DA and direct lateral (DL) approaches to THA and to determine patient risk factors that may contribute to this problem. All patients who underwent primary THA with a single surgeon over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were treated with either the DA or DL approach. Data collected included patient demographics, surgical approach, and wound status. There was a minimum follow-up of 6 weeks to allow for an adequate assessment of surgical wound healing. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare the 2 approaches. Five hundred seventy-nine patients (77.6%) who underwent DA approach and 167 patients (22.4%) who underwent DL approach were included. Patients who underwent DL approach had a higher body mass index and a higher rate of diabetes than those treated with the DA approach. Forty patients (6.9%) in the DA cohort and 14 (8.4%) in the DL cohort experienced early wound complications, <i>P</i> = .523. After controlling for potential confounding variables, the surgical approach was not an independent risk factor for early postoperative wound complications. While there have been concerns regarding use of the DA approach in patients with higher body mass index and certain medical comorbidities, the results of this study suggest the choice of surgical approach may have minimal effect on the rate of early postoperative wound complications.",['Carlock KD; Wilkerson JB; Yamaguchi JT; Fernando ND'],2024,"study aimed to compare the risk of early postoperative wound complications between the DA and direct lateral approaches to total hip arthroplasty (THA) all patients who underwent primary THA with a single surgeon over a 5-year period were retrospectively reviewed. data collected included patient demographics, surgical approach, and wound status."
Anti-obesity effects of a standardized ethanol extract of <i>Eisenia bicyclis</i> by regulating the AMPK signaling pathway in 3T3-L1 cells and HFD-induced mice.,"Obesity requires treatment to mitigate the potential development of further metabolic disorders, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tumor growth, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We investigated the anti-obesity effect of a 30% ethanol extract of <i>Eisenia bicyclis</i> (Kjellman) Setchell (EEB) on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6 mice. Adipogenesis transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBPα), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) were ameliorated through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway by EEB treatment in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. EEB attenuated mitotic clonal expansion by upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) while downregulating cyclins and CDKs. In HFD-fed mice, EEB significantly decreased the total body weight, fat tissue weight, and fat in the tissue. The protein expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SREBP-1 was increased in the subcutaneous fat and liver tissues, while EEB decreased the expression levels of these transcription factors. EEB also inhibited lipogenesis by downregulating acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression in the subcutaneous fat and liver tissues. Moreover, the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was downregulated in the HFD-induced mouse group, whereas the administration of EEB improved AMPK and ACC phosphorylation; thus, EEB treatment may be related to the AMPK pathway. Histological analysis showed that EEB reduced the adipocyte size and fat accumulation in subcutaneous fat and liver tissues, respectively. EEB promotes thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and improves insulin and leptin levels and blood lipid profiles. Our results suggest that EEB could be used as a potential agent to prevent obesity.",['Yoon YS; Chung KS; Lee SY; Heo SW; Kim YR; Lee JK; Kim H; Park S; Shin YK; Lee KT'],2024,"a 30% ethanol extract of i>Eisenia bicyclis/i> was used on 3T3-L1 mice. adipogenesis transcription factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) were ameliorated through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway"
Exploring factors and trends in place of death by cancer: a population-based study in Brazil.,"The place of death profoundly affects end-of-life care quality, particularly in cancer. Assisting individuals at home enhances support, privacy, and control, reducing healthcare costs. This study seeks to elucidate factors associated and trends in place of death by cancer in Brazil. Using data obtained from the National Mortality Information System, this study extracted tumour topography, sociodemographic characteristics, and the place of death (outcome classified into hospital or home death) by cancer in Brazil from 2002 to 2021. The analysis included 3,677,415 cases, with 82.3% of deaths occurring in hospitals and 17.7% at home. Most participants were male (53.1%), had gastrointestinal tumours (32.2%), and resided in the Southeastern region (48.7%). Home deaths were more frequent in the Northeastern (30.2%) and Northern (24.8%) regions compared to the Southern (17.1%) and Southeastern (12.2%) regions. A strong inverse correlation was found between home deaths and the Human Development Index of the region. Over the years, there was a reduction in home deaths, followed by a recent increase. Individuals with no formal education, indigenous individuals, and patients from the North, Northeast, and Central-West regions had higher rates of home deaths, while patients with haematological malignancies had lower rates compared to those with gastrointestinal tumours.

Psychometric Properties of the Automated Insulin Delivery - Benefits and Burdens Scale (AID-BBS) for Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.,"To evaluate the psychometric properties of a patient-reported outcome measure, The Automated Insulin Delivery - Benefits and Burdens Scale (AID-BBS), which was designed to assess benefits and burdens of AID use in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The measure was hypothesized to have validity, reliability, and clinical utility for predicting likelihood of continued use of an AID system. 217 adults with T1D (ages 18 to 82 years) who were enrolled in an AID system research trial completed AID-BBS items at study midpoint (6 weeks) and at the end of the trial (13 weeks). Data were collected on pre-post glycemic outcomes. Participants completed other patient-reported psychosocial outcome measures (e.g., emotional well-being, diabetes distress, attitudes toward diabetes technology, diabetes treatment satisfaction) at Week 13. Likelihood of continued device use was assessed with three items at 13 weeks. Exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor structure for each subscale (15-item benefit and 9-item burden subscale) when evaluated separately. Convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were supported. Benefit and burden subscales at week 6 predicted usage intention above and beyond device impact on glycemic outcomes, also controlling for baseline glycemic outcomes. Findings support the AID-BBS as a psychometrically valid, reliable, and useful instrument for assessing burdens and benefits associated with AID system use in adults with T1D. The measure can be used to help health care providers set realistic expectations and proactively address modifiable burdens.",['Shapiro JB; Vesco AT; Carroll MS; Weissberg-Benchell J'],2024,"the AID-BBS was designed to assess benefits and burdens of AID use in adults with type 1 diabetes (t1D) the measure was hypothesized to have validity, reliability, and clinical utility."
"Long-term (11 Years) Results of Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass: Changes in Weight, Blood Levels of Sugar and Lipids, and Late Adverse Effects : Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass Results.","Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) remains the most effective procedure to treat severe obesity with proven short- and intermediate-term benefits. The main goal is to describe the effects on weight and biochemical laboratory tests after long-term follow-up (11 years). A prospective cohort of adults with obesity treated with LRYGB between 2004 and 2010 in one center were studied. Patients with prior bariatric or upper digestive tract surgery, hiatal hernia >4 cm, alcoholism, or decompensated conditions were excluded. The study enrolled 123 patients, with a mean follow-up of 133±29 months and a 14% loss of participants. The percentage of Total Weight Loss (%TWL) at one, five, and eleven years was 30.3±8.4%, 29.1±6.9%, and 23.4±7%, respectively. Of the patients, 61.3% (65/106) maintained a %TWL≥20 after eleven years. Recurrent Weight Gain (RWG) at five and eleven years was 2.6±11.4% and 11 ±11.5%, respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 31.1% (33/106) of patients had RWG≥15%. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia improved in 85.7% (54/63) and 90.2% (7/61) of the cohort, respectively. Remission of diabetes occurred in 80% of this subgroup. Gallstones developed in 28% of patients, and bowel obstruction due to internal hernia occurred in 9.4%. Anemia due to iron deficiency appeared in 25 patients.

Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: It Is Time for a New Model!,"An agreed-upon consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from healthy β-cells is essential for understanding diabetes pathophysiology. Since the discovery of the KATP channel in 1984, an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-driven rise in ATP has been assumed to close KATP channels to initiate insulin secretion. This model lacks any evidence, genetic or otherwise, that mitochondria possess the bioenergetics to raise the ATP/ADP ratio to the triggering threshold, and conflicts with genetic evidence demonstrating that OxPhos is dispensable for insulin secretion. It also conflates the stoichiometric yield of OxPhos with thermodynamics, and overestimates OxPhos by failing to account for established features of β-cell metabolism, such as leak, anaplerosis, cataplerosis, and NADPH production that subtract from the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. We have proposed an alternative model, based on the spatial and bioenergetic specializations of β-cell metabolism, in which glycolysis initiates insulin secretion. The evidence for this model includes that 1) glycolysis has high control strength over insulin secretion; 2) glycolysis is active at the correct time to explain KATP channel closure; 3) plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes control KATP channels; 4) pyruvate kinase has favorable bioenergetics, relative to OxPhos, for raising ATP/ADP; and 5) OxPhos stalls before membrane depolarization and increases after. Although several key experiments remain to evaluate this model, the 1984 model is based purely on circumstantial evidence and must be rescued by causal, mechanistic experiments if it is to endure.",['Merrins MJ; Kibbey RG'],2024,a consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from healthy -cells is essential. the model lacks any evidence that mitochondria possess bioenergetics. it conflicts with genetic evidence demonstrating that OxPhos is dispensable for insulin secretion.
Clinical Warburg Effect in a Patient With Mantle Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report.,"The clinical Warburg effect is a rare occurrence in cancer biology where tumor cells primarily utilize glycolysis for energy production, leading to significant hypoglycemia and lactate formation. This presentation is associated with a poor prognosis for the patient. In this context, we describe the case of a 53-year-old woman with stage IV mantle cell lymphoma who developed the clinical Warburg effect with solely arrhythmia and without neurological symptoms. She received prompt treatment for glucose stabilization and underwent inpatient chemotherapy. This case underscores the importance of early intervention to reduce tumor burden and highlights the effectiveness of hemodialysis in stabilizing metabolic acidosis.

Novel Dihydropteridinone Derivatives As Potent Inhibitors of the Understudied Human Kinases Vaccinia-Related Kinase 1 and Casein Kinase 1δ/ε.,"Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) and the δ and ε isoforms of casein kinase 1 (CK1) are linked to various disease-relevant pathways. However, the lack of tool compounds for these kinases has significantly hampered our understanding of their cellular functions and therapeutic potential. Here, we describe the structure-based development of potent inhibitors of VRK1, a kinase highly expressed in various tumor types and crucial for cell proliferation and genome integrity. Kinome-wide profiling revealed that our compounds also inhibit CK1δ and CK1ε. We demonstrate that dihydropteridinones <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> mimic the cellular outcomes of VRK1 depletion. Complementary studies with existing CK1δ and CK1ε inhibitors suggest that these kinases may play overlapping roles in cell proliferation and genome instability.

Outcome of pregnancy oral glucose tolerance test and preterm birth.,"Gestational diabetes is associated with adverse outcomes such as preterm birth (<37 weeks). However, there is no international consensus on screening criteria or diagnostic levels for gestational diabetes, and it is unknown whether body mass index (BMI) or obesity modifies the relation between glucose level and preterm birth. We studied a pregnancy cohort restricted to two Danish regions from the linked Danish Medical Birth Register to study associations between glucose measurements from the 2-hour post-load 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (one-step approach) and preterm birth from 2004-2018. In Denmark, gestational diabetes screening is a targeted strategy for mothers with identified risk factors. We used Poisson regression to estimate rate ratios (RR) of preterm birth with z-standardized glucose measurements. We assessed effect measure modification by stratifying analyses and testing for heterogeneity. Among 11,337 pregnancies (6.2% delivered preterm), we observed an adjusted preterm birth RR of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.1-1.3) for a 1 standard deviation glucose increase of 1.4 mmol/L from the mean 6.7 mmol/L. There was evidence for effect measure modification by obesity, e.g., adjusted RR for non-obese (BMI <30): 1.2 (95%CI: 1.1-1.3) vs. obese (BMI ≥30): 1.3 (95%CI: 1.2-1.5), P=0.05 for heterogeneity. Among mothers screened for gestational diabetes, increased glucose levels, even those below the diagnostic level for gestational diabetes in Denmark, were associated with increased preterm birth risk. Obesity (BMI ≥30) may be an effect measure modifier, not just a confounder, of the relation between blood glucose and preterm birth risk.",['Liang R; Panelli DM; Stevenson DK; Rehkopf DH; Shaw GM; Sørensen HT; Pedersen L'],2024,a pregnancy cohort restricted to two regions from the linked Danish Medical Birth Register studied association between glucose measurements from the 2-hour post-load 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (one-step approach) and preterm birth from 2004-2018. gestational diabetes screening is a targeted strategy for mothers with identified risk factors.

This article retrospectively collected elderly patients with hip fracture and CHD who underwent hip fracture surgery at the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University from January 2019 to December 2021. Demographic data, laboratory indicators, and imaging examination results were collected from the medical case system. The risk factors of postoperative AMI were determined by univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and a nomogram prediction model was established. The ROC curve, calibration curve and DCA decision curve were plotted by R language software. The patients in the training set were followed up for 2 years to evaluate their survival situation. 1094 eligible patients were divided into a training set (n = 824 from January 1, 2019 to September 31, 2021) and a validation set (n = 270 from October 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022). In the training set, women accounted for 58.6%; The average age of the patients was 79.45 years old; The main type of fracture was intertrochanteric fracture. There were 64.7% patients taken B receptor blockers; A total of 166 (20.1%) patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); Hypertension accounted for 55.5%; 520 (63.1%) patients had a preoperative waiting time greater than 3 days; The average hemoglobin value upon admission was 101.36 g/L; The average intraoperative bleeding volume was 212.42 ml; The average surgical time was 2.5 ± 0.3 h; Reginal anesthesia accounted for 29.7%; 63 (68.5%) AMI patients had no obvious clinical symptoms; 68 (73.9%) AMI patients did not show ST-segment elevation in ECG; The risk factors of postoperative AMI were age, hemoglobin at admission, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, intraoperative bleeding, and reginal anesthesia. The AUC of the nomogram prediction model was 0.729. The AUC in the validation set was 0.783. Survival analysis showed a significant statistical difference in 2-year mortality between patients with AMI and without AMI, among all the patients with AMI, patients with ECG ST-segment elevation has higher mortality than patients without ECG ST-segment elevation.

Berberine directly targets AKR1B10 protein to modulate lipid and glucose metabolism disorders in NAFLD.,"Berberine (BBR) is the main active component from Coptidis rhizome, a well-known Chinese herbal medicine used for metabolic diseases, especially diabetes for thousands of years. BBR has been reported to cure various metabolic disorders, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the direct proteomic targets and underlying molecular mechanism of BBR against NAFLD remain less understood. To investigate the direct target and corresponding molecular mechanism of BBR on NAFLD is the aim of the current study. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and oleic acid (OA) stimulated HepG2 cells were utilized to verify the beneficial impacts of BBR on glycolipid metabolism profiles. The click chemistry in proteomics, DARTS, CETSA, SPR and fluorescence co-localization analysis were conducted to identify the targets of BBR for NAFLD. RNA-seq and shRNA/siRNA were used to investigate the downstream pathways of the target. BBR improved hepatic steatosis, ameliorated insulin resistance, and reduced TG levels in the NAFLD models. Importantly, Aldo-keto reductase 1B10 (AKR1B10) was first proved as the target of BBR for NAFLD. The gene expression of AKR1B10 increased significantly in the NAFLD patients' liver tissue. We further demonstrated that HFD and OA increased AKR1B10 expression in the C57BL/6 mice's liver and HepG2 cells, respectively, whereas BBR decreased the expression and activities of AKR1B10. Moreover, the knockdown of AKR1B10 by applying shRNA/siRNA profoundly impacted the beneficial effects on the pathogenesis of NAFLD by BBR. Meanwhile, the changes in various proteins (ACC1, CPT-1, GLUT2, etc.) are responsible for hepatic lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, etc. by BBR were reversed by the knockdown of AKR1B10. Additionally, RNA-seq was used to identify the downstream pathway of AKR1B10 by examining the gene expression of liver tissues from HFD-fed mice. Our findings revealed that BBR markedly increased the protein levels of PPARα while downregulating the expression of PPARγ. However, various proteins of PPAR signaling pathways remained unaffected post the knockdown of AKR1B10. BBR alleviated NAFLD via mediating PPAR signaling pathways through targeting AKR1B10. This study proved that AKR1B10 is a novel target of BBR for NAFLD treatment and helps to find new targets for the treatment of NAFLD by using active natural compounds isolated from traditional herbal medicines as the probe.",['Yang S; Cao SJ; Li CY; Zhang Q; Zhang BL; Qiu F; Kang N'],2024,BBR has been reported to cure various metabolic disorders. but the direct proteomic targets and underlying molecular mechanism of BBR against NAFLD remain less understood. high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice and oleic acid stimulated HepG2 cells were used to verify the beneficial impacts of BBR on glycolipid metabolism profiles.
"The impact of addition of pearl millet starch-germ complex in white bread on nutritional, textural, structural, and glycaemic response: Single blinded randomized controlled trial in healthy and pre-diabetic participants.","The rise of pre-diabetes at the global level has created a significant interest in developing low glycaemic index food products. The pearl millet is a cheaper source of starch and its germ contains significant amount of protein and fat. The complexing of pearl millet starch and germ by dry heat treatment (PMSGH) resulted an increase in the resistant starch content upto 45.09 % due to formation of amylose-glutelin-linoleic acid complex. The resulting pearl millet starch germ complex was incorporated into wheat bread at 20, 25, and 30 %. The PMSGH incorporated into bread at 30 % reduced the glycaemic index to 52.31. The PMSGH incorporated bread had significantly (p < 0.05)increased in the hardness with a reduction in springiness and cohesiveness. The structural attributes of the 30 % PMSGH incorporated bread revealed a significant (p < 0.05)increase in 1040/1020 cm<sup>-1</sup> ratio and relative crystallinity. The consumption of functional bread incorporated with pearl millet starch germ complex reduced blood glucose levels and in vivo glycaemic index in healthy and pre-diabetic participants when compared to white bread. Hence, the study showed that the incorporation of pearl millet starch-germ complex into food products could be a potential new and healthier approach for improving dietary options in pre-diabetes care.",['Vidhyalakshmi R; Prabhasankar P; Muthukumar SP; Prathima C; Meera MS'],2024,"the pearl millet starch germ complex was incorporated into wheat bread at 20, 25 and 30 %. the PMSGH incorporated bread reduced the glycaemic index to 52.31. the resulting pearl millet starch germ complex was incorporated into wheat bread at 20, 25 and 30 %."
Mathematical modeling of the synergistic interplay of radiotherapy and immunotherapy in anti-cancer treatments.,"While radiotherapy has long been recognized for its ability to directly ablate cancer cells through necrosis or apoptosis, radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect suggests that its impact extends beyond local tumor destruction thanks to immune response. Cellular proliferation and necrosis have been extensively studied using mathematical models that simulate tumor growth, such as Gompertz law, and the radiation effects, such as the linear-quadratic model. However, the effectiveness of radiotherapy-induced immune responses may vary among patients due to individual differences in radiation sensitivity and other factors. We present a novel macroscopic approach designed to quantitatively analyze the intricate dynamics governing the interactions among the immune system, radiotherapy, and tumor progression. Building upon previous research demonstrating the synergistic effects of radiotherapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment, we provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these interactions. Our method leverages macroscopic observations and mathematical modeling to capture the overarching dynamics of this interplay, offering valuable insights for optimizing cancer treatment strategies. One shows that Gompertz law can describe therapy effects with two effective parameters. This result permits quantitative data analyses, which give useful indications for the disease progression and clinical decisions. Through validation against diverse data sets from the literature, we demonstrate the reliability and versatility of our approach in predicting the time evolution of the disease and assessing the potential efficacy of radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations. This further supports the promising potential of the abscopal effect, suggesting that in select cases, depending on tumor size, it may confer full efficacy to radiotherapy.",['Castorina P; Castiglione F; Ferini G; Forte S; Martorana E; Giuffrida D'],2024,"radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect suggests its impact extends beyond local tumor destruction thanks to immune response. cellular proliferation and necrosis have been extensively studied using mathematical models that simulate tumor growth. however, the effectiveness of radiotherapy-induced immune responses may vary among patients due to individual differences in radiation sensitivity and other factors."

lncRNA PAARH impacts liver cancer cell proliferation by engaging miR‑6512‑3p to target LASP1.,"Long non-coding (lnc)RNAs serve a pivotal role as regulatory factors in carcinogenesis. The present study aimed to assess the involvement of the lncRNA progression and angiogenesis-associated RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (PAARH) in liver cancer, along with the associated underlying mechanism. Through the use of reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR, differences in the expression levels of PAARH in HepG2, HEP3B2.1.7, HCCLM3, Huh-7 and MHCC97-H liver cancer cell lines and THLE-2 epithelial cell lines were evaluated. The liver cancer cell line with the greatest, significantly different, level of expression relative to the normal liver cell line was selected for subsequent experiments. Using ENCORI database, the putative target genes of the microRNA (miR) miR-6512-3p were predicted. Cells were then transfected with lentiviruses carrying short-hairpin-PAARH to interfere with PAARH expression. Subsequently, HepG2 liver cancer cells were transfected with a miR-6512-3p mimic and an inhibitor, and the expression levels of miR-6512-3p and the LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) in cells were assessed using RT-qPCR analysis. Cell proliferation was subsequently evaluated using colony formation assays, and immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to assess the expression level of LASP1 in transfected cells. The binding interaction between miR-6512-3p and LASP1 was further evaluated using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Liver cancer cells were found to exhibit higher expression levels of PAARH compared with normal liver cells. Following PAARH interference, the expression level of miR-6512-3p was significantly increased, whereas that of LASP1 was significantly decreased, resulting in a reduction in cell proliferation. In liver cancer cells, miR-6512-3p overexpression led to a significant reduction in the LASP1 level and reduced proliferation, whereas suppressing miR-6512-3p led to a significant increase in LASP1 levels and increased proliferation. Additionally, the inhibition of miR-6512-3p caused the states of low LASP1 expression and reduced cell proliferation to be reversed. LASP1, a recently identified target gene of miR-6512-3p, was demonstrated to be suppressed by miR-6512-3p overexpression, thereby inhibiting liver cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, the findings of the present study demonstrate that the lncRNA PAARH may enhance liver cancer cell proliferation by engaging miR-6512-3p to target LASP1.",['Wei Q; Liu G; Huang Z; Nian J; Huang L; Huang Y; Huang Z; Pu J'],2024,lncRNA progression and angiogenesis-associated RNA in liver cancer were evaluated. differences in expression levels of PAARH in liver cancer cell lines were evaluated. lncRNA progression and angiogenesis-associated RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma (PAARH) in liver cancer.
Unveiling unique clinical phenotypes of hip fracture patients and the temporal association with cardiovascular events.,"Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death among hip fracture patients. This study aims to identify subphenotypes of hip fracture patients and investigate their association with incident cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and health service utilisation in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom populations. By the latent class analysis, we show three distinct clusters in the Hong Kong cohort (n = 78,417): Cluster 1 has cerebrovascular and hypertensive diseases, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes; Cluster 2 has congestive heart failure; Cluster 3 consists of relatively healthy patients. Compared to Cluster 3, higher risks of major adverse cardiovascular events are observed in Cluster 1 (hazard ratio 1.97, 95% CI 1.83 to 2.12) and Cluster 2 (hazard ratio 4.06, 95% CI 3.78 to 4.35). Clusters 1 and 2 are also associated with a higher risk of mortality, more unplanned accident and emergency visits and longer hospital stays. Self-controlled case series analysis shows a significantly elevated risk of major adverse cardiovascular events within 60 days post-hip fracture. Similar associations are observed in the United Kingdom cohort (n = 27,948).

Risks of carpal tunnel syndrome and carpal tunnel release surgery in users of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a target trial emulation study.,"Preclinical studies have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have a neuroprotective effect. This study compared the risks of carpal tunnel syndrome and carpal tunnel release surgery between new users of SGLT2is and new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). A retrospective new-user active comparator cohort study with a target trial design was conducted by using the TriNetX platform. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus prescribed SGLT2is or GLP-1RAs were identified. Covariates were balanced using propensity score matching to form 2 homogenous treatment groups. Outcomes were the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and the risk of carpal tunnel release surgery. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the TriNetX platform. The crude cohort included 86188 and 100244 patients in the SGLT2is group and GLP-1RAs group, respectively. After matching, each group included 65464 patients. The SGLT2is group had an average age of 59.6 years, and 46% were women. The GLP-1RAs group had an average age of 59.5 years, and 45.9% were women. The incidences of carpal tunnel syndrome (HR: 0.928; 95% CI: 0.869 to 0.991) and carpal tunnel release surgery (HR: 0.840; 95% CI: 0.726 to 0.971) were significantly lower in the SGLT2is group than in the GLP-1RAs group. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, SGLT2is seem to decrease the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and the need for carpal tunnel release surgery. Prospective studies are required to confirm our results.",['Su YC; Hsieh PC; Lai EC; Lin YC; Lin YC'],2024,a retrospective new-user active comparator cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX platform. patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus prescribed SGLT2is or GLP-1RAs were identified.
Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cell carcinoma: an oncology care institutional experience.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 2% of all cancer cases worldwide, and majority are sporadic. The latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification of renal cell tumors (fifth edition, 2022) has molecularly defined renal tumor entities, which includes fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient RCC. FH-deficient RCC is an aggressive carcinoma caused by pathogenic alterations in FH gene, seen in 15% of patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome (HLRCC) syndrome. These tumors occur more frequently at a younger age and present at an advanced stage, carrying a dismal prognosis. We report a series of 10 cases of FH-deficient RCC. The mean age was 49.8 years, and all cases presented in advanced stages (III and IV). Morphologically, the cases had varied architectural patterns with characteristic eosinophilic macronucleoli and perinucleolar halo.

Extracellular vesicles in glioblastoma: a challenge and an opportunity.,Glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous tumor whose pathophysiological complexities dictate both the diagnosis of disease severity as well as response to therapy. Conventional diagnostic tools and standard treatment regimens have only managed to achieve limited success in the management of patients suspected of glioblastoma. Extracellular vesicles are an emerging liquid biopsy tool that has shown great promise in resolving the limitations presented by the heterogeneous nature of glioblastoma. Here we discuss the contrasting yet interdependent dual role of extracellular vesicles as communication agents that contribute to the progression of glioblastoma by creating a heterogeneous microenvironment and as a liquid biopsy tool providing an opportunity to accurately identify the disease severity and progression.,['Indira Chandran V; Gopala S; Venkat EH; Kjolby M; Nejsum P'],2024,extracellular vesicles are emerging liquid biopsy tool that has shown great promise in resolving the limitations presented by the heterogeneous nature of glioblastoma. this is a highly heterogeneous tumor whose pathophysiological complexities dictate both the diagnosis of disease severity as well as response to therapy.
Beyond CAR T cells: exploring alternative cell sources for CAR-like cellular therapies.,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has led to remarkable clinical outcomes in the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, challenges remain, such as limited infiltration into solid tumors, inadequate persistence, systemic toxicities, and manufacturing insufficiencies. The use of alternative cell sources for CAR-based therapies, such as natural killer cells (NK), macrophages (MΦ), invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, γδT cells, neutrophils, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), has emerged as a promising avenue. By harnessing these cells' inherent cytotoxic mechanisms and incorporating CAR technology, common CAR-T cell-related limitations can be effectively mitigated. We herein present an overview of the tumoricidal mechanisms, CAR designs, and manufacturing processes of CAR-NK cells, CAR-MΦ, CAR-iNKT cells, CAR-γδT cells, CAR-neutrophils, and iPSC-derived CAR-cells, outlining the advantages, limitations, and potential solutions of these therapeutic strategies.",['Tsiverioti CA; Gottschlich A; Theurich S; Anders HJ; Kroiss M; Kobold S; Trefny M'],2024,hematological malignancies have been treated with a hematological malignancy. but the use of alternative cell sources for CAR-based therapies has emerged as a promising avenue.
Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome in korea: 20 years of clinical observation and evaluation of the ventilation strategy in a single center.,"Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypoventilation due to impaired breathing control by the central nervous system and other symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. Mutations in paired-like homeobox 2 B (PHOX2B) are responsible for most cases of CCHS. Patients with CCHS have various phenotypes and severities, making the diagnosis difficult. This study aimed to present a comprehensive single-center experience of patients with CCHS, including key clinical features, treatment strategies, and outcomes. A retrospective chart review was performed for patients diagnosed with CCHS between January 2001 and July 2023 at Seoul National University Children's Hospital. Finally, we selected 24 patients and collected their demographic data, genotypes, ventilation methods, and clinical features related to autonomic dysfunction. The relationship between the clinical manifestations and genotypes was also examined. All patients used home ventilators, and tracheostomy was performed in 87.5% of patients. Fifteen (62.5%) patients had constipation and nine (37.5%) were diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease. Arrhythmia, endocrine dysfunction, and subclinical hypothyroidism were present in nine (37.5%), six patients (25.0%), and two patients (16.7%), respectively. A significant number of patients exhibited neurodevelopmental delays (19 patients, 79.2%). There was a correlation between the phenotype and genotype of PHOX2B in patients with CCHS. (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).   Conclusion: There was a positive correlation between paired-like homeobox 2 B mutations (especially the number of GCN repeats in the polyalanine repeat mutations sequence) and clinical manifestations. This study also demonstrated how initial treatment for hypoventilation affects neurodevelopmental outcomes in patients with CCHS. What is Known: • Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypoventilation and dysfunction of autonomic nervous system. • The disease-defining gene of CCHS is PHOX2B gene - most of the cases have heterozygous PARMs and the number of GCN triplets varies among the patients(20/24 - 20/33). What is New: • We have noted in the Korean patients with CCHS that there is a correlation between genotype (number of GCN repeats) and severity of phenotype. • National support for rare diseases allowed for a prompter diagnosis of patients with CCHS in Korean population.",['Lee MJ; Park JS; Kim K; Ko JM; Park JD; Suh DI'],2024,"CCHS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypoventilation due to impaired breathing control by the central nervous system. patients with CCHS have various phenotypes and severities, making the diagnosis difficult. a retrospective chart review was performed for patients diagnosed with CCHS between January 2001 and July 2023."

The prognostic impact of peripheral blood eosinophil counts in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients treated with nivolumab.,"Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have gained approval for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), the response rate is still limited. Therefore, it is urgent to explore novel markers of responses to ICIs that can help assess clinical benefits. Recently, it has been noted that peripheral blood eosinophil counts are an independent factor correlated with clinical outcome of ICIs in some types of cancer. We investigated peripheral blood absolute eosinophil counts (AECs) at baseline and 4 weeks after the initiation of nivolumab for mRCC patients between February 2016 and May 2022. In addition, we examined clinicopathological features including irAEs and analyzed the correlation between AECs and clinical efficacy of nivolumab. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients were 5.7 and 25.5 months, respectively. The median AECs in patients with irAEs were significantly higher at baseline and 4 weeks after the treatment compared to those without irAEs (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001). With the cutoff value of AECs of 329 cells/µL at 4 weeks after the treatment for prediction of irAEs, high-AECs groups had significantly higher number of responders compared with that in low-AECs group (p < 0.001). Accordingly, the PFS and OS were significantly better in patients with high-AECs group than those in low-AECs group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.009). High-AECs at 4 weeks after the treatment serve as the prominent surrogate marker associated with the incidence of irAEs and better clinical outcome in mRCC patients receiving nivolumab.",['Yoshimura A; Nagahara A; Ishizuya Y; Yamamoto Y; Hatano K; Kawashima A; Nakai Y; Nakayama M; Nishimura K; Nonomura N; Kato T'],2024,mRCC patients have been diagnosed with eosinophil counts. eosinophil counts are an independent factor correlated with clinical outcome. mRCC patients have been diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Automated Analysis of Nuclear Parameters in Oral Exfoliative Cytology Using Machine Learning.,"As oral cancer remains a major worldwide health concern, sophisticated diagnostic tools are needed to aid in early diagnosis. Non-invasive methods like exfoliative cytology, albeit with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), have drawn additional interest. The study aimed to harness the power of machine learning algorithms for the automated analysis of nuclear parameters in oral exfoliative cytology. Further, the analysis of two different AI systems, namely convoluted neural networks (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM), were compared for accuracy. A comparative diagnostic study was performed in two groups of patients (n=60). The control group without evidence of lesions (n=30) and the other group with clinically suspicious oral malignancy (n=30) were evaluated. All patients underwent cytological smears using an exfoliative cytology brush, followed by routine Hematoxylin and Eosin staining. Image preprocessing, data splitting, machine learning, model development, feature extraction, and model evaluation were done. An independent t-test was run on each nuclear characteristic, and Pearson's correlation coefficient test was performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).  The study found substantial variations between the study and control groups in nuclear size (p<0.05), nuclear shape (p<0.01), and chromatin distribution (p<0.001). The Pearson correlation coefficient of SVM was 0.6472, and CNN was 0.7790, showing that SVM had more accuracy. The availability of multidimensional datasets, combined with breakthroughs in high-performance computers and new deep-learning architectures, has resulted in an explosion of AI use in numerous areas of oncology research. The discerned diagnostic accuracy exhibited by the SVM and CNN models suggests prospective improvements in early detection rates, potentially improving patient outcomes and enhancing healthcare practices.",['Mhaske S; Ramalingam K; Nair P; Patel S; Menon P A; Malik N; Mhaske S'],2024,non-invasive methods like exfoliative cytology have drawn additional interest. study aimed to harness the power of machine learning algorithms. control group without evidence of lesions (n=30) and other group with clinically suspicious oral malignancy (n=30) were evaluated.
Chondroitin polymerizing factor promotes development and progression of colorectal cancer via facilitating transcription of VEGFB.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent malignancy affecting the digestive system on a global scale. This study aimed to explore the previously unexplored role of CHPF in the progression of CRC. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of CHPF expression in CRC tumour tissues compared to normal tissues, with its levels correlating with tumour malignancy. In vitro experiments using CRC cell lines demonstrated that inhibiting CHPF expression suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation and cell migration, while promoting apoptosis. Conversely, overexpressing CHPF had the opposite effect. Additionally, our xenograft models in mice confirmed the inhibitory impact of CHPF knockdown on CRC progression using various cell models. Mechanistic investigations unveiled that CHPF may enhance VEGFB expression through E2F1-mediated transcription. Functionally, suppressing VEGFB expression successfully mitigated the oncogenic effects induced by CHPF overexpression. Collectively, these findings suggest that CHPF may act as a tumour promoter in CRC, operating in a VEGFB-dependent manner and could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in CRC treatment.",['Huang Y; Zhang Z; Tong H; Qin W; Li Q; Ma L; Ren Z; Chen W; Zhang Y; Zhong Y; Yao L; Zhou P'],2024,xenograft models in mice confirmed the inhibitory impact of CHPF knockdown on CRC progression. a significant upregulation of CHPF expression in CRC tumour tissues compared to normal tissues.
Integrating Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Approach to Elucidate the Mechanism of <i>Commiphora wightii</i> for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is considered a notable prolonged inflammatory condition with no proper cure. Synovial inflammation and synovial pannus are crucial in the onset of RA. The ""tumor-like"" invading proliferation of new arteries is a keynote of RA. Commiphora wightii (<i>C wightii</i>) is a perennial, deciduous, and trifoliate plant used in several areas of southeast Asia to cure numerous ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, obesity, and asthma. Several <i>in vitro</i> investigations have indicated <i>C wightii's</i> therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of arthritis. However, the precise molecular action is yet unknown. In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to uncover potential targets, active therapeutic ingredients and signaling pathways in <i>C wightii</i> for the treatment of arthritis. In the groundwork of this research, we examined the active constituent-compound-target-pathway network and evaluated that (Guggulsterol-V, Myrrhahnone B, and Campesterol) decisively donated to the development of arthritis by affecting tumor necrosis factor (TNF), PIK3CA, and MAPK3 genes. Later on, docking was employed to confirm the active components' efficiency against the potential targets. According to molecular-docking research, several potential targets of RA bind tightly with the corresponding key active ingredient of <i>C wightii.</i> With the aid of network pharmacology techniques, we conclude that the signaling pathways and biological processes involved in <i>C wightii</i> had an impact on the prevention of arthritis. The outcomes of molecular docking also serve as strong recommendations for future research. In the context of this study, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking analysis showed that <i>C wightii</i> acted on arthritis-related signaling pathways to exhibit a promising preventive impact on arthritis. These results serve as the basis for grasping the mechanism of the antiarthritis activity of <i>C wightii</i>.

Blood calprotectin as a biomarker for infection and sepsis - the prospective CASCADE trial.,"Early in the host-response to infection, neutrophils release calprotectin, triggering several immune signalling cascades. In acute infection management, identifying infected patients and stratifying these by risk of deterioration into sepsis, are crucial tasks. Recruiting a heterogenous population of patients with suspected infections from the emergency department, early in the care-path, the CASCADE trial aimed to evaluate the accuracy of blood calprotectin for detecting bacterial infections, estimating disease severity, and predicting clinical deterioration. In a prospective, observational trial from February 2021 to August 2022, 395 patients (n = 194 clinically suspected infection; n = 201 controls) were enrolled. Blood samples were collected at enrolment. The accuracy of calprotectin to identify bacterial infections, and to predict and identify sepsis and mortality was analysed. These endpoints were determined by a panel of experts. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) of calprotectin for detecting bacterial infections was 0.90. For sepsis within 72 h, calprotectin's AUROC was 0.83. For 30-day mortality it was 0.78. In patients with diabetes, calprotectin had an AUROC of 0.94 for identifying bacterial infection.

Variability in methodology of erectile dysfunction regenerative therapy trials on ClinicalTrials.gov.,"To evaluate the variability in the criteria of erectile dysfunction (ED) regenerative therapy trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Interventional trials on ClinicalTrials.gov with the keywords ""erectile dysfunction"" and variations of ""shockwave,"" ""platelet rich plasma,"" ""stem cell,"" ""regenerative,"" and ""restorative"" were examined. Inclusion/exclusion criteria and primary/secondary outcomes were compared between extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), platelet rich plasma and stem cell injections (PRP/SC), and other regenerative therapies (ORT) groups. Of the 92 trials analyzed, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score was the most common primary outcome (72%), with a higher prevalence in ESWT trials than PRP/SC or ORT trials (89% vs 44% and 58%, p<.001). Safety/tolerability was a primary outcome for 44% of PRP/SC trials and 25% of ORT trials but no ESWT trials (p<.001). ESWT trials more frequently had sexual/romantic relationship-based inclusion criteria and cancer treatment-related exclusion criteria than PRP/SC and ORT trials. There is substantial variability in the inclusion/exclusion criteria and outcome measures among ED regenerative therapy trials. ESWT trials most frequently utilized IIEF and had the strictest inclusion/exclusion criteria, suggesting more rigorous and functional outcome-based studies.

Efficacy of Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel for the diabetic lower extremity arterial disease patients with foot ulcers.,"Diabetes foot is one of the most serious complications of diabetes and an important cause of death and disability, traditional treatment has poor efficacy and there is an urgent need to develop a practical treatment method. To investigate whether Huangma Ding or autologous platelet-rich gel (APG) treatment would benefit diabetic lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) patients with foot ulcers. A total of 155 diabetic LEAD patients with foot ulcers were enrolled and divided into three groups: Group A (62 patients; basal treatment), Group B (38 patients; basal treatment and APG), and Group C (55 patients; basal treatment and Huangma Ding). All patients underwent routine follow-up visits for six months. After follow-up, we calculated the changes in all variables from baseline and determined the differences between groups and the relationships between parameters. The infection status of the three groups before treatment was the same. Procalcitonin (PCT) improved after APG and Huangma Ding treatment more than after traditional treatment and was significantly greater in Group C than in Group B. Logistic regression analysis revealed that PCT was positively correlated with total amputation, primary amputation, and minor amputation rates. The ankle-brachial pressure and the transcutaneous oxygen pressure in Groups B and C were greater than those in Group A. The major amputation rate, minor amputation rate, and total amputation times in Groups B and C were lower than those in Group A. Our research indicated that diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) lead to major amputation, minor amputation, and total amputation through local infection and poor microcirculation and macrocirculation. Huangma Ding and APG were effective attreating DFUs. The clinical efficacy of Huangma Ding was better than that of autologous platelet gel, which may be related to the better control of local infection by Huangma Ding.

Determining the patency of biliary tracts in dogs with gallbladder mucocele using near-infrared cholangiography with indocyanine green.,"Cholecystectomy is indicated for gallbladder mucoceles (GBM). Evaluating the patency of the biliary duct and precise biliary tree visualization is crucial for reducing the risk of compromised bile flow after surgery. Therefore, intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) is recommended during cholecystectomy to prevent biliary tract injury. Although indocyanine green (ICG) cholangiography has been extensively reported in human medicine, only one study has been conducted in veterinary medicine. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the use of ICG for IOC to identify fluorescent biliary tract images and determine the patency of the common bile duct during cholecystectomy in dogs. This study comprised 27 dogs, consisting of 17 with gallbladder mucoceles (GBM) and 10 controls, specifically including dogs that had undergone elective cholecystectomy for GBM. ICG injection (0.25 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at least 45 minutes before surgery. During the operation, fluorescent images from cholangiography were displayed on the monitor and obtained in black-and-white mode for the comparison of fluorescence intensity (FI). The FI values of the gallbladders (GBs) and common bile duct (CBD) were measured using FI analyzing software (MGViewer V1.1.1, MetapleBio Inc.). The results demonstrated successful CBD patency identification in all cases. Mobile GBM showed partial gallbladder visibility, whereas immobile GBM showed limited visibility. Additionally, insights into the adequate visualization of the remaining extrahepatic biliary tree anatomy were provided, extending beyond the assessment of CBD patency and gallbladder intensity. Our study demonstrates the potential of fluorescent IOC using intravenous injection of ICG for assessing the patency of the cystic duct and common bile duct during cholecystectomy in patients with GBM, eliminating the need for surgical catheterization and flushing of the biliary ducts.

Novel Insights in the Hypertension Treatment & Type 2 Diabetics Induced by Angiotensin Receptor Blockers: MD Simulation Studies & Molecular Docking of Some Promising Natural Therapies.,"Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used to treat hypertension that target the hormonal system (renin-angiotensin system (RAS)), which regulates various physiological functions in the body. ARBs work by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor, thereby preventing a rise in blood pressure. These drugs not only normalize the overactivation of RAS but also provide protective effects against cardiovascular, renal, and type 2 diabetic patients. Inappropriate RAS activity has been linked to insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes. Olmesartan, as an ARB, was found to have a beneficial role in reducing postprandial glucose levels in type 2 diabetes. However, ARBs can cause side effects, prompting a search for new compounds that have fewer adverse effects. This study explores the potential of natural metabolites, specifically eugenol, gallic acid, myricetin, <i>p</i>-cymene, quercetin, and kaempferol, as ARB inhibitors compared to the current standard, olmesartan. Using in silico studies, the binding affinity of these natural substances to the ARB receptor was evaluated. The results showed that myricetin and kaempferol had affinities higher than those of olmesartan, suggesting that they could serve as promising ARB inhibitors for hypertension treatment. These natural compounds could provide an alternative approach to conventional antihypertensive drugs, which may have fewer side effects. However, more research is needed to validate the efficacy and safety of these natural compounds as antihypertensive drugs. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm their effectiveness and safety. This study provides a promising starting point for future investigations into the potential of natural metabolites as alternative treatments for hypertension. The findings also highlight the importance of exploring natural alternative treatments for hypertension and the protective effects of ARBs on early stage type-2 diabetics.",['Mahmoud MR; Shahien MM; Ibrahim S; S Alenazi F; Hussein W; Abdallah MH; Aljadani A; Alreshidi F; E El-Horany H; M Osman Elhussein GE; Abdeen H Abdalla R; H Elhaj A; M Khalifa A'],2024,"angiotensin receptor blockers are commonly used to treat hypertension. they work by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor. this preventing a rise in blood pressure. these drugs provide protective effects against cardiovascular, renal, and type 2 diabetic patients."

Inflammatory age and its impact on age-related health in older Chinese adults.,"A standardized measure for inflammaging is lacking. We introduced the inflammatory age (iAge) as a quantification method and explored its associations with age-related traits and diseases in an older Chinese cohort. Inflammatory markers including white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, C-reactive protein, platelets and albumin were measured. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to measure telomere length. Traditional multivariable linear, partial least squares, and logistic regression were used. iAge was constructed based on WBC, neutrophils, monocytes and albumin, which were associated with telomere length independently. A higher iAge indicated a heavier aging-related inflammation burden.

Exploring different classification-dependent QSAR modelling strategies for HDAC3 inhibitors in search of meaningful structural contributors.,"Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent class I HDACs, contributes to numerous disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and several types of cancers. Therefore, the development of novel and selective HDAC3 inhibitors might be promising to combat such diseases. Here, different classification-based molecular modelling studies such as Bayesian classification, recursive partitioning (RP), SARpy and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were conducted on a set of HDAC3 inhibitors to pinpoint essential structural requirements contributing to HDAC3 inhibition followed by molecular docking study and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses. The current study revealed the importance of hydroxamate function for Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelation as well as hydrogen bonding interaction with Tyr298 residue. The importance of hydroxamate function for higher HDAC3 inhibition was noticed in the case of Bayesian classification, recursive partitioning and SARpy models. Also, the importance of substituted thiazole ring was revealed, whereas the presence of linear alkyl groups with carboxylic acid function, any type of ester function, benzodiazepine moiety and methoxy group in the molecular structure can be detrimental to HDAC3 inhibition. Therefore, this study can aid in the design and discovery of effective novel HDAC3 inhibitors in the future.",['Jha T; Jana R; Banerjee S; Baidya SK; Amin SA; Gayen S; Ghosh B; Adhikari N'],2024,the development of novel and selective HDAC3 inhibitors might be promising to combat such diseases. the current study revealed the importance of hydroxamate function for higher HDAC3 inhibition.
Variables that predict hospital stay and the outcome of Fournier gangrene at King Abdulaziz University Hospital: a retrospective study.,"The aggressive nature of Fournier gangrene and the associated health issues can result in a more complex clinical course and potentially a longer hospital stay. This study aimed to assess factors that affect the length of hospital stay (LHS) and its relation to the outcome of Fournier gangrene patients. A retrospective study was performed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Saudi Arabia, on patients diagnosed with Fournier gangrene between 2017 and 2023. Data about length of hospital stay (LHS), age, BMI, clinical and surgical data and outcome was obtained. The mean age of the studied patients was 59.23 ± 11.19 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.69 ± 7.99 kg/m<sup>2,</sup> and the mean duration of symptoms was 10.27 ± 9.16 days. The most common presenting symptoms were swelling or induration (64%), 88% had comorbidities with diabetes mellitus (DM) (84%), and 76% had uncontrolled DM. of patients, 24% had a poly-microbial infection, with E. coli being the most common (52%). The mean length of hospital stay (LHS) was 54.56 ± 54.57 days, and 24% of patients had an LHS of more than 50 days. Longer LHS (> 50 days) was associated with patients who did not receive a compatible initial antibiotic, whereas shorter LHS was associated with patients who received Impenem or a combination of vancomycin and meropenem as alternative antibiotics following incompatibility. Reconstruction patients had significantly longer LHS and a higher mean temperature. However, none of the studied variables were found to be predictors of long LHS in the multivariate regression analysis. Knowledge of the values that predict LHS allows for patient-centered treatment and may be useful in predicting more radical treatments or the need for additional treatment in high-risk patients. Future multicenter prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to assess the needed variables and predictors of long LHS.",['Alhubaishy B; Bahassan OM; Alsabban AE; Alkhzaim AH; Alnefaie ZA; Algarni KS; Almehmadi SG; Alqahtani SN'],2024,"retrospective study was performed at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in kauh, Saudi Arabia. data about length of hospital stay, age, BMI, clinical and surgical data and outcome was obtained. most common presenting symptoms were swelling or induration (64%), 88% had comorbidities with diabetes mellitus (84%), 76% had uncontrolled DM."
"Urban-Rural Differences in the Prevalence of Diabetes Among Adults in Haryana, India: The ICMR-INDIAB Study (ICMR-INDIAB-18).","Diabetes is a multifactorial disease with far-reaching consequences. Environmental factors, such as urban or rural residence, influence its prevalence and associated comorbidities. Haryana-a north Indian state-has undergone rapid urbanisation, and part of it is included in the National Capital Region (NCR). The primary aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of diabetes in Haryana with urban-rural, NCR and non-NCR regional stratification and assess the factors affecting the likelihood of having diabetes among adults. This sub-group analysis of the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study (a nationally representative cross-sectional population-based survey) was done for Haryana using data from 3722 participants. The dependent variable was diabetes, while residence in NCR/non-NCR and urban-rural areas were prime independent variables. Weighted prevalence was estimated using state-specific sampling weights and standardized using National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) study weights. Associations were depicted using bivariate analysis, and factors describing the likelihood of living with diabetes were explored using a multivariable binary logistic regression analysis approach. Overall, the weighted prevalence of diabetes in Haryana was higher than the national average (12.4% vs. 11.4%). The prevalence was higher in urban (17.9%) than in rural areas (9.5%). The prevalence of diabetes in rural areas was higher in the NCR region, while that of prediabetes was higher in rural non-NCR region. Urban-rural participants' anthropometric measurements and biochemical profiles depicted non-significant differences. Urban-rural status, age and physical activity levels were the most significant factors that affected the likelihood of living with diabetes. The current analysis provides robust prevalence estimates highlighting the urban-rural disparities. Urban areas continue to have a high prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes; rural areas depict a much higher prevalence of prediabetes than diabetes. With the economic transition rapidly bridging the gap between urban and rural populations, health policymakers should plan efficient strategies to tackle the diabetes epidemic.",['Kalra S; Anjana RM; Verma M; Pradeepa R; Sharma N; Deepa M; Singh O; Venkatesan U; Elangovan N; Aggarwal S; Kakkar R; Mohan V'],2024,"the study was done for Haryana using data from 3722 participants. the dependent variable was diabetes, while residence in NCR/non-NCR and urban-rural areas were prime independent variables."
Congressional Expansion of Enhancing Breast Cancer Screening and Care at the Veterans Health Administration.,"Despite high screening rates, breast cancer disparities persist among women veterans because of occupational risks and barriers to access.

Role of Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase Pathways in Metabolic Diseases.,"Physiological processes that govern the normal functioning of mammalian cells are regulated by a myriad of signalling pathways. Mammalian mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases constitute one of the major signalling arms and have been broadly classified into four groups that include extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and ERK5. Each signalling cascade is governed by a wide array of external and cellular stimuli, which play a critical part in mammalian cells in the regulation of various key responses, such as mitogenic growth, differentiation, stress responses, as well as inflammation. This evolutionarily conserved MAP kinase signalling arm is also important for metabolic maintenance, which is tightly coordinated via complicated mechanisms that include the intricate interaction of scaffold proteins, recognition through cognate motifs, action of phosphatases, distinct subcellular localisation, and even post-translational modifications. Aberration in the signalling pathway itself or their regulation has been implicated in the disruption of metabolic homeostasis, which provides a pathophysiological foundation in the development of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is an umbrella term that usually includes a group of closely associated metabolic diseases such as hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and hypertension. These risk factors exacerbate the development of obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and hepatic diseases, which have accounted for an increase in the worldwide morbidity and mortality rate. This review aims to summarise recent findings that have implicated MAP kinase signalling in the development of metabolic diseases, highlighting the potential therapeutic targets of this pathway to be investigated further for the attenuation of these diseases.",['Ng GYQ; Loh ZW; Fann DY; Mallilankaraman K; Arumugam TV; Hande MP'],2024,"mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinases are regulated by a myriad of signals. each signalling cascade is governed by a wide array of external and cellular stimuli.

Ten-Year Risk Equations for Incident Heart Failure in Established Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Populations.,"Ten-year risk equations for incident heart failure (HF) are available for the general population, but not for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is highly prevalent in HF cohorts. This study aimed to develop and validate 10-year risk equations for incident HF in patients with known ASCVD. Ten-year risk equations for incident HF were developed using the United Kingdom Biobank cohort (recruitment 2006-2010) including participants with established ASCVD but free from HF at baseline. Model performance was validated using the Australian Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute Biobank cohort (recruitment 2000-2011) and compared with the performance of general population risk models. Incident HF occurred in 13.7% of the development cohort (n=31 446, median 63 years, 35% women, follow-up 10.7±2.7 years) and in 21.3% of the validation cohort (n=1659, median age 65 years, 25% women, follow-up 9.4±3.7 years). Predictors of HF included in the sex-specific models were age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure (treated or untreated), glucose (treated or untreated), cholesterol, smoking status, QRS duration, kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. ASCVD-HF equations had good discrimination and calibration in development and validation cohorts, with superior performance to general population risk equations. ASCVD-specific 10-year risk equations for HF outperform general population risk models in individuals with established ASCVD. The ASCVD-HF equations can be calculated from readily available clinical data and could facilitate screening and preventative treatment decisions in this high-risk group.",['Dawson LP; Carrington MJ; Haregu T; Nanayakkara S; Jennings G; Dart A; Stub D; Inouye M; Kaye D'],2024,ten-year risk equations for incident HF are available for the general population. but not for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Quantitative proteomics reveals CLR interactome in primary human cells.,"The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) mediates essential functions in several cell types and is implicated in cardiovascular pathologies, skin diseases, migraine and cancer. To date, the network of proteins interacting with CLR (""CLR interactome"") in primary cells, where this GPCR is expressed at endogenous (physiologically relevant) levels, remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we established a novel integrative methodological workflow/approach for conducting a comprehensive/proteome-wide analysis of Homo sapiens CLR interactome. We used primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells and combined immunoprecipitation (IP) utilising anti-human CLR antibody with label-free quantitative nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS) and quantitative in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA). By using this workflow, we identified 37 proteins interacting with endogenously expressed CLR amongst 4,902 detected members of the cellular proteome (by quantitative nano LC-MS/MS) and revealed direct interactions of two kinases and two transporters with this GPCR (by in situ PLA). All identified interactors have not been previously reported as members of CLR interactome. Our approach and findings uncover the hitherto unrecognized compositional complexity of the interactome of endogenously expressed CLR and contribute to fundamental understanding of the biology of this GPCR. Collectively, our study provides a first-of-its-kind integrative methodological approach and datasets as valuable resources and robust platform/springboard for advancing the discovery and comprehensive characterization of physiologically relevant CLR interactome at a proteome-wide level in a range of cell types and diseases in future studies.","[""Manolis D; Hasan S; Maraveyas A; O'Brien DP; Kessler BM; Kramer H; Nikitenko LL""]",2024,calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) mediates essential functions in several cell types. the network of proteins interacting with CLR in primary cells remains unknown. we used primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells and combined immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-human antibody.
Between Pathological Prostate Cancer Lymph Nodes and Sentinel Nodes: Which Information Is the Leader?,"On the basis of the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), SLNs should contain decisive information for clinical outcomes. In localized prostate cancer patients, this study assessed retrospectively clinical outcome after radical laparoscopic prostatectomy associated with SLNB and extensive pelvic lymph node dissection. A total of 231 consecutive patients of intermediate to high risk were analyzed. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curves. Various pathological parameters were analyzed using univariable and multivariable analyses through Cox regression analysis. The study was approved and registered under 2007-R41. The median follow-up was 7.1 years (95% confidence interval, 6.6-7.5). In total, 38/231 (16.5%) patients were pN1. Of these 38 patients, 27 had only SLN involvement (SLNI), 10 patients had both SLN and non-SLNI, and 1 patient had isolated non-SLNI, indicating a false-negative (FN). If the updated Briganti nomogram threshold set at >7% for recommending extensive pelvic lymph node dissection had been applied to these patients, we would have missed 44% (12/27) of patients with SLNI and 50% (5/10) of patients with SLNI and non-SLNI, as well as the FN patient. At the time of final follow-up, 84/231 (36.5%) patients had recurrence. In multivariable analysis, and regarding node status, the most significant prognostic factor was SLN with macrometastases and/or micrometastases, respectively, P = 10-3 and P < 10-3. No more information was obtained with non-SLN status. Probabilities of RFS between negative and positive SLN patients presented a major significant difference (P < 10-15) with a risk of event 8.75 times more frequent if SLN was involved than if it was metastasis-free. SLNB seems to contain decisive information for the clinical outcome of patients with localized intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients. The question raised is thus whether immediate additional postoperative treatment should be offered to patients with metastatic SLN.",['Morel A; Rousseau T; Ferrer L; Lacoste J; Nevoux P; Picot-Dilly E; Le Thiec M; Rusu D; Campion L; Rousseau C'],2024,a total of 231 consecutive patients of intermediate to high risk were analyzed. a total of 38/231 (16.5%) patients were pN1. a total of 38/231 (16.5%) patients were pN1.
Multivariate curve resolution-based data fusion approaches applied in <sup>1</sup>H NMR metabolomic analysis of healthy cohorts.,"Metabolomics plays a critical role in deciphering metabolic alterations within individuals, demanding the use of sophisticated analytical methodologies to navigate its intricate complexity. While many studies focus on single biofluid types, simultaneous analysis of multiple matrices enhances understanding of complex biological mechanisms. Consequently, the development of data fusion methods enabling multiblock analysis becomes essential for comprehensive insights into metabolic dynamics. This study introduces a novel guideline for jointly analyzing diverse metabolomic datasets (serum, urine, metadata) with a focus on metabolic differences between groups within a healthy cohort. The guideline presents two fusion strategies, 'Low-Level data fusion' (LLDF) and 'Mid-Level data fusion' (MLDF), employing a sequential application of Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), linking the outcomes of successive analyses. MCR-ALS is a versatile method for analyzing mixed data, adaptable at various stages of data processing-encompassing resonance integration, data compression, and exploratory analysis. The LLDF and MLDF strategies were applied to <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral data extracted from urine and serum samples, coupled with biochemical metadata sourced from 145 healthy volunteers. Both methodologies effectively integrated and analysed multiblock datasets, unveiling the inherent data structure and variables associated with discernible factors among healthy cohorts. While both approaches successfully detected sex-related differences, the MLDF strategy uniquely revealed components linked to age. By applying this analysis, we aim to enhance the interpretation of intricate biological mechanisms and uncover variations that may not be easily discernible through individual data analysis.",['Martínez Bilesio AR; Puig-Castellví F; Tauler R; Sciara M; Fay F; Rasia RM; Burdisso P; García-Reiriz AG'],2024,a new guideline for analyzing diverse metabolomic datasets. the fusion strategy enables multiblock analysis. the guideline presents two fusion strategies.
Blocking the angiopoietin-2-dependent integrin β-1 signaling axis abrogates small cell lung cancer invasion and metastasis.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive lung cancer entity with an extremely limited therapeutic outcome. Most patients are diagnosed at an extensive stage. However, the molecular mechanisms driving SCLC invasion and metastasis remain largely elusive. We used an autochthonous SCLC mouse model and matched samples from patients with primary and metastatic SCLC to investigate the molecular characteristics of tumor metastasis. We demonstrate that tumor cell invasion and liver metastasis in SCLC are triggered by an Angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2)/Integrin β-1-dependent pathway in tumor cells, mediated by focal adhesion kinase/Src kinase signaling. Strikingly, CRISPR-Cas9 KO of Integrin β-1 or blocking Integrin β-1 signaling by an anti-ANG-2 treatment abrogates liver metastasis formation in vivo. Interestingly, analysis of a unique collection of matched samples from patients with primary and metastatic SCLC confirmed a strong increase of Integrin β-1 in liver metastasis in comparison with the primary tumor. We further show that ANG-2 blockade combined with PD-1-targeted by anti-PD-1 treatment displays synergistic treatment effects in SCLC. Together, our data demonstrate a fundamental role of ANG-2/Integrin β-1 signaling in SCLC cells for tumor cell invasion and liver metastasis and provide a potentially new effective treatment strategy for patients with SCLC.",['Meder L; Orschel CI; Otto CJ; Koker M; Brägelmann J; Ercanoglu MS; Dähling S; Compes A; Selenz C; Nill M; Dietlein F; Florin A; Eich ML; Borchmann S; Odenthal M; Blazquez R; Hilberg F; Klein F; Hallek M; Büttner R; Reinhardt HC; Ullrich RT'],2024,"small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive lung cancer entity with an extremely limited therapeutic outcome. most patients are diagnosed at an extensive stage. however, the molecular mechanisms driving SCLC invasion and metastasis remain largely elusive."
"Glucokinase regulatory protein rs780094 polymorphism is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and nephropathy.","In this editorial, we comment on the article by Liu <i>et al</i> published in the recent issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i> (Relationship between GCKR gene rs780094 polymorphism and type 2 diabetes with albuminuria). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disorder characterized by dysregulated glucose homeostasis. The persistent elevated blood glucose level in T2DM significantly increases the risk of developing severe complications, including cardiovascular disease, re-tinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. T2DM arises from a complex interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Global genomic studies have identified numerous genetic variations associated with an increased risk of T2DM. Specifically, variations within the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) gene have been linked to heightened susceptibility to T2DM and its associated complications. The clinical trial by Liu <i>et al</i> further elucidates the role of the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in T2DM and nephropathy development. Their findings demonstrate that individuals carrying the CT or TT genotype at the GCKR rs780094 locus are at a higher risk of developing T2DM with albuminuria compared to those with the CC genotype. These findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and risk assessment in T2DM to develop effective preventive strategies and personalized treatment plans.",['Al Madhoun A'],2024,a clinical trial by Liu i>et al/i> further elucidates the role of the GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in T2DM and its associated complications. the findings highlight the importance of genetic testing and risk assessment in T2DM to develop effective preventive strategies and personalized personalized services.
Evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics of dengue viral infection and risk factors of dengue hemorrhagic fever: a multi-center retrospective analysis.,"Dengue Viral Infection (DVI) has become endemic in Pakistan since the first major outbreak in Karachi in 1996. Despite aggressive measures taken by relevant authorities, Pakistan has been dealing with a worsening dengue crisis for the past two decades. DHF is severe form of dengue infection which is linked with significant morbidity and mortality. Early identification of severe dengue infections can reduce the morbidity and mortality. In this context we planned current study in which we find out the different factors related with DHF as well as clinical laboratory features of DHF and compare them to DF so that patients can be best evaluated for DHF and managed accordingly at admission. Retrospective study conducted over a period of 6 years (2013-2018) in two tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan. Data were collected by using a pre-structured data collection form. Data were statistically analyzed to determine the clinical and laboratory characteristics of DVI and risk factors of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). A total 512 dengue cases (34.05 ± 15.08 years; Male 69.53%) were reviewed. Most common clinical manifestations of DVI were fever (99.60%), headache (89.1%), chills (86.5%), rigors (86.5%), myalgia (72.3%). Less common clinical manifestations were vomiting (52.5%), arthralgia (50.2%) and skin rashes (47.5%). Furthermore, nasal bleeding (44.1%), gum bleeding (32.6%), pleural effusion (13.9%) and hematuria (13.1%) were more profound clinical presentations among DHF patients. Mortality rate was 1.5% in this study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that delayed hospitalization (OR: 2.30) and diabetes mellitus (OR:2.71), shortness of breath (OR:2.21), association with risk groups i.e., living near stagnant water, travelling to endemic areas, living in endemic regions (OR:1.95), and presence of warning signs (OR:2.18) were identified as risk factors of DHF. Statistically we found that there is strong association of diabetes mellitus (DM) with DHF while the patient suffering from DM individually had higher odds (2.71) of developing DHF than patients without disease. The current study demonstrated that the clinical and laboratory profiles of DF and DHF are significantly distinct. Significant predictors of DHF were advanced age, diabetes mellitus, ascites, pleural effusion, thick gallbladder and delayed hospitalization. The identification of these factors at early stage provides opportunities for the clinicians to identify high risk patients and to reduce dengue-related morbidity and mortality.",['Riaz M; Harun SNB; Mallhi TH; Khan YH; Butt MH; Husain A; Khan MM; Khan AH'],2024,"despite aggressive measures taken by relevant authorities, Pakistan has been dealing with a worsening dengue crisis for the past two decades. despite aggressive measures taken by relevant authorities, the situation has been worsening for two decades."
Tracking Drugs and Lipids: Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Imaging of Liposomal Doxorubicin Delivery and Bilayer Fate in Three-Dimensional Tumor Models.,"Targeted therapy to the tumor would greatly advance precision medicine. Many drug delivery vehicles have emerged, but liposomes are cited as the most successful to date. Recent efforts to develop liposomal drug delivery systems focus on drug distribution in tissues and ignore liposomal fate. In this study, we developed a novel method to elucidate both drug and liposomal bilayer distribution in a three-dimensional cell culture model using quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI qMSI) alongside fluorescence microscopy. Imaging liposomal distribution in a cell culture model is challenging, as lipids forming the bilayer are endogenous to the model system. To resolve this issue, we functionalized the bilayer by chemically cross-linking a fluorescent tag to the alkyne-containing lipid hexynoyl phosphoethanolamine (HPE). We synthesized liposomes incorporating the tagged HPE lipid and encapsulated within them doxorubicin, yielding a theranostic liposome capable of both drug delivery and monitoring liposomal uptake. We employed an ""in-tissue"" MALDI qMSI approach to generate a calibration curve with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9687, allowing for quantification of doxorubicin within spheroid sections at multiple time points. After 72 h of treatment with the theranostic liposomes, full doxorubicin penetration was observed. The metabolites doxorubicinone and 7-deoxydoxorubicinone were also detected after 48 h. Modification of the bilayer allowed for fluorescence microscopy tracking of liposomes, while MALDI MSI simultaneously permitted the imaging of drugs and metabolites. While we demonstrated the utility of our method with doxorubicin, this system could be applied to examine the uptake, release, and metabolism of many other liposome-encapsulated drugs.",['Lopez A; Holbrook JH; Kemper GE; Lukowski JK; Andrews WT; Hummon AB'],2024,liposomes are cited as the most successful to date. recent efforts to develop liposomal drug delivery systems focus on drug distribution. liposomes are cited as the most successful to date.
Appendicular lean mass and the risk of stroke and Alzheimer's disease: a mendelian randomization study.,"Appendicular lean mass (ALM) is a good predictive biomarker for sarcopenia. And previous studies have reported the association between ALM and stroke or Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, the causal relationship is still unclear, The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether genetically predicted ALM is causally associated with the risk of stroke and AD by performing Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. A two-sample MR study was designed. Genetic variants associated with the ALM were obtained from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) and utilized as instrumental variables (IVs). Summary-level data for stroke and AD were generated from the corresponding GWASs. We used random-effect inverse-variance weighted (IVW) as the main method for estimating causal effects, complemented by several sensitivity analyses, including the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) methods. Multivariable analysis was further conducted to adjust for confounding factors, including body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), low density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C), and atrial fibrillation (AF). The present MR study indicated significant inverse associations of genetically predicted ALM with any ischemic stroke ([AIS], odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-0.97; P = 0.002) and AD (OR, 090; 95% CI 0.85-0.96; P = 0.001). Regarding the subtypes of AIS, genetically predicted ALM was related to the risk of large artery stroke ([LAS], OR, 0.86; 95% CI 0.77-0.95; P = 0.005) and small vessel stroke ([SVS], OR, 0.80; 95% CI 0.73-0.89; P < 0.001). Regarding multivariable MR analysis, ALM retained the stable effect on AIS when adjusting for BMI, LDL-C, and AF, while a suggestive association was observed after adjusting for T2DM. And the estimated effect of ALM on LAS was significant after adjustment for BMI and AF, while a suggestive association was found after adjusting for T2DM and LDL-C. Besides, the estimated effects of ALM were still significant on SVS and AD after adjustment for BMI, T2DM, LDL-C, and AF. The two-sample MR analysis indicated that genetically predicted ALM was negatively related to AIS and AD. And the subgroup analysis of AIS revealed a negative causal effect of genetically predicted ALM on LAS or SVS. Future studies are required to further investigate the underlying mechanisms.",['Zhu Y; Zhu F; Guo X; Huang S; Yang Y; Zhang Q'],2024,genetically predicted ALM is causally associated with stroke and AD.

Interleukin 1β receptor blocker (Anakinra) and regenerative stem cell therapy: two novel approaches effectively ameliorating diabetic cardiomyopathy.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a serious common complication of diabetes. Unfortunately, there is no satisfied treatment for those patients and more studies are in critical need to cure them. Therefore, we aimed to carry out our current research to explore the role of two novel therapeutic approaches: one a biological drug aimed to block inflammatory signaling of the IL 1beta (IL1β) axis, namely, anakinra; the other is provision of anti-inflammatory regenerative stem cells. Wistar male rats were allocated into four groups: control group: type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) induced by 6-week high-fat diet (HFD) followed by a single-dose streptozotocin (STZ) 35 mg/kg i.p., then rats were allocated into: DM: untreated; DM BM-MSCs: received a single dose of BM-MSCs (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cell/rat) into rat tail vein; DM-Anak received Anak 0.5 μg/kg/day i.p. for 2 weeks. Both therapeutic approaches improved cardiac performance, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. In addition, blood glucose and insulin resistance decreased, while the antioxidant parameter, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and interleukin 10 (IL10), and anti-inflammatory agent increased. Furthermore, there is a significant reduction in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), IL1β, caspase1, macrophage marker CD 11b, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and T-cell marker CD 8. Both Anak and BM-MSCs effectively ameliorated inflammatory markers and cardiac performance as compared to non-treated diabetics. Improvement is mostly due to anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic properties, and regulation of TNFα/IL1β/caspase1 and Nrf2/IL10 pathways.",['Mahmoud LM; Mageed AAAA; Saadallah JM; Youssef MF; Rashed LA; Ammar HI'],2024,"a biological drug aimed to block inflammatory signaling of the IL1 axis, namely, anakinra. the other is provision of anti-inflammatory regenerative stem cells. rats were allocated into four groups: control group: type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) induced by 6-week high-fat diet (HFD) followed by a single-dose streptozotocin (STZ) 35 mg/kg i.p., then rats were allocated into four"
Distinctive Lipid Characteristics of Colorectal Cancer Revealed through Non-targeted Lipidomics Analysis of Tongue Coating.,"The metabolites and microbiota in tongue coating display distinct characteristics in certain digestive disorders, yet their relationship with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unexplored. Here, we employed liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the lipid composition of tongue coating using a nontargeted approach in 30 individuals with colorectal adenomas (CRA), 32 with CRC, and 30 healthy controls (HC). We identified 21 tongue coating lipids that effectively distinguished CRC from HC (AUC = 0.89), and 9 lipids that differentiated CRC from CRA (AUC = 0.9). Furthermore, we observed significant alterations in the tongue coating lipid composition in the CRC group compared to HC/CRA groups. As the adenoma-cancer sequence progressed, there was an increase in long-chain unsaturated triglycerides (TG) levels and a decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen (PE-P) levels. Furthermore, we noted a positive correlation between <i>N</i>-acyl ornithine (NAOrn), sphingomyelin (SM), and ceramide phosphoethanolamine (PE-Cer), potentially produced by members of the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> phylum. The levels of inflammatory lipid metabolite 12-HETE showed a decreasing trend with colorectal tumor progression, indicating the potential involvement of tongue coating microbiota and tumor immune regulation in early CRC development. Our findings highlight the potential utility of tongue coating lipid analysis as a noninvasive tool for CRC diagnosis.",['Chen Q; Lin F; Li W; Gu X; Chen Y; Su H; Zhang L; Zheng W; Zeng X; Lu X; Wang C; Chen W; Zhang B; Zhang H; Gong M'],2024,"tongue coating lipid composition is a lipid-related factor in colorectal cancer. adenoma-cancer sequence progressed, with a decrease in triglycerides. adenoma-cancer sequence progressed, with a decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen levels."

CD133-targeted multifunctional nanomicelles for dual-modality imaging and synergistic high-intensity focus ultrasound (HIFU) ablation on pancreatic cancer in nude mice.,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and highly fatal malignant tumor. Recent studies have shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs) play an important role in resisting current therapeutic modalities. Furthermore, CD133 is highly expressed in CSCs. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy for unresectable pancreatic cancers. In our study, we synthesized targeted CD133 organosilane nanomicelles by encapsulating perfluorohexane (PFH). The CD133 antibody on the surface could specifically bind to CD133-positive pancreatic cancer cells and selectively concentrate in pancreatic cancer tumor tissues. PFH was introduced to improve the ablation effect of HIFU due to its liquid-gas phase transition properties. By combining with the dorsal skinfold window chamber model (DSWC) of pancreatic cancer in nude mice, multiphoton fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate the targeting effect of nanomicelles on pancreatic cancer tumor tissue. These multifunctional nanomicelles synergistically affected HIFU treatment of pancreatic cancer, providing an integrated research platform for diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer with HIFU.",['Yao Y; Zheng Y; Wu M; Gao Y; Yu Q; Liu M; Luo X; Wang R; Jiang L'],2024,cancer stem cells play an important role in resisting current therapeutic modalities. high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy for unresectable pancreatic cancers.

"Survival, incidence, and predictors of diabetic neuropathy among type 2 diabetic patients in hospitals of Addis Ababa.","Diabetic neuropathy is a very common complication of diabetes mellitus. Thus, measuring the incidence of diabetic neuropathy is a key element in tracking the progress of epidemics of diabetes mellitus and an indication of early accessibility for healthcare in terms of type 2 diabetic patients. To assess survival, incidence, and predictors of diabetic neuropathy among type 2 diabetic patients in hospitals of Addis Ababa from June 25 to August 25, 2023. An institutional-based retrospective follow-up study design was used among newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients at hospitals of Addis Ababa. A chart review tool that contains socio-demographic, clinical, and comorbidity characteristics, biochemical characteristics, and the status of type 2 patients was used. A cleaned data was exported from Epi-data manager 4.6 version to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Bivariate Cox regression analysis was done to identify predictors of diabetic neuropathy at a 95% confidence level. A total of 414 type 2 diabetic patients were included in the study. Of these, 97 (23.4%) developed diabetic neuropathy. Variables like having hypertension (AHR 11.25, 95% CI 3.73-33.93), anemia (AHR 4.18, 95% CI 1.78-9.82), high-density lipoprotein < 40 mg/dl (AHR 5.07, 95% CI 1.38-18.67), high creatinine level (AHR 14.67, 95% CI 4.27-50.40), diabetic retinopathy (AHR 4.32, 95% CI 1.32-14.18), and diabetic nephropathy (AHR 2.50, 95% CI 1.09-6.57) were associated with the incidence of diabetic neuropathy. The mean time to develop diabetic neuropathy was 4.94 years, CI (4.50-5.38), and the mean survival time was 6.61 years. The incidence of diabetic neuropathy was high relative to other studies.

Akkermansia muciniphila ameliorates colonic injury in mice with DSS-induced acute colitis by blocking macrophage pro-inflammatory phenotype switching via the HDAC5/DAB2 axis.,"Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), a probiotic, has been linked to macrophage phenotypic polarization in different diseases. However, the role and mechanisms of A. muciniphila in regulating macrophage during ulcerative colitis (UC) are not clear. This research aimed to examine the impact of A. muciniphila on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced acute colitis and elucidate the underlying mechanism related to macrophage phenotypic polarization. A. muciniphila inhibited weight loss, increased disease activity index, and ameliorated inflammatory injury in colonic tissues in mice induced with DSS. Furthermore, A. muciniphila reduced macrophage M1 polarization and ameliorated epithelial barrier damage in colonic tissues of DSS-induced mice through inhibition of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5). In contrast, the effect of A. muciniphila was compromised by HDAC5 overexpression. HDAC5 deacetylated H3K9ac modification of the disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) promoter, which led to repressed DAB2 expression. DAB2 overexpression blocked HDAC5-induced pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages, whereas knockdown of DAB2 resulted in the loss of effects of A. muciniphila against colonic injury in DSS-induced mice. Taken together, A. muciniphila-induced loss of HDAC5 hampered the deacetylation of DAB2 and enhanced the expression of DAB2. Our findings propose that A. muciniphila may be a possible probiotic agent for alleviating DSS-induced acute colitis.",['Miao Y; Wang M; Sun H; Zhang Y; Zhou W; Yang W; Duan L; Niu L; Li Z; Chen J; Li Y; Fan A; Xie Q; Wei S; Bai H; Wang C; Chen Q; Wang X; Li Y; Liu J; Han Y; Fan D; Hong L'],2024,"a probiotic, A. muciniphila has been linked to macrophage phenotypic polarization in different diseases. but the role and mechanisms of A. muciniphila in regulating macrophage during ulcerative colitis are not clear."
Genetic Association of Interleukin 16 Gene Polymorphisms (rs11556218 & rs4778889) with Type 1 Diabetes in Egyptian Children: A Case-Control Study.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a serious chronic autoimmune condition. Even though the underlying reason for the onset of T1D is unknown, due to their effector and regulatory roles in immune responses, cytokines are essential in developing autoimmune disorders. Interleukin (IL)16 is an immunomodulatory cytokine implicated in several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This study was designed to examine the association of IL16 gene polymorphisms, rs11556218 T > G and rs4778889 T > C, with the risk of T1D in Egyptian children. Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay, we analyzed rs11556218 T > G and rs4778889 T > C polymorphisms of the IL16 gene in 100 T1D subjects and 93 controls. Rs11556218 T > G polymorphism of the IL16 gene was not associated with the risk of developing T1D. Analysis of IL16 gene rs4778889 T > C showed that the TT genotype had a considerably higher risk of T1D than the TC genotype [OR = 2.195 (1.205-3.999)]. In comparison to patients with the C allele [OR = 0.6914 (0.38-1.2569)], patients with the T allele [OR = 1.45 (0.7956-2.6296)] were notably more likely to have T1D. A significant decrease was found in the frequency of GT (OR = 0.43, <i>p</i> = .03) and TC (OR = 0.32, <i>p</i> = .011) haplotypes of IL16 gene rs11556218 T > G and rs4778889 T > C polymorphisms in T1D patients compared with controls. IL16 gene rs4778889 T > C polymorphism might be associated with susceptibility to T1D. Egyptians with TT genotypes are more likely to develop T1D. However, GT and TC haplotypes of IL16 gene rs11556218 T > G and rs4778889 T > C polymorphisms highlight their protective role againstT1D disease.",['Ali YBM; Saed MM; Abdel-Hakem NE; Hussein MAEA; El-Shahat M'],2024,cytokines are essential in developing autoimmune disorders. rs11556218 T > G and rs4778889 T > C polymorphisms of the IL16 gene were not associated with the risk of developing T1D.
A novel Bayesian generative approach for estimating tumor dynamics from published studies.,"Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) modeling attempts to describe the time course changes in tumor size for patients undergoing cancer therapy. TGI models present several advantages over traditional exposure-response models that are based explicitly on clinical end points and have become a popular tool in the pharmacometrics community. Unfortunately, the data required to fit TGI models, namely longitudinal tumor measurements, are sparse or often not available in literature or publicly accessible databases. On the contrary, common end points such as progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are directly derived from longitudinal tumor measurements and are routinely published. To this end, a Bayesian generative model relating underlying tumor dynamics to summary PFS and ORR data is introduced to learn TGI model parameters using only published summary data. The parameterized model can describe the tumor dynamics, quantify treatment effect, and account for differences in the study population. The utility of this model is shown by applying it to several published studies, and learned parameters are combined to simulate an in silico trial of a novel combination therapy in a novel setting.",['Pourzanjani A; Modi S; Connarn J; Zhang X; Upreti V; Lin CW; Mehta K'],2024,"a Bayesian generative model relating underlying tumor dynamics to summary tumor measurements is introduced to learn TGI model parameters using only published summary data. the parameterized model can describe the tumor dynamics, quantify treatment effect, and account for differences in the study population."
Overall Volume of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery Positively Impacts Gastric Cancer Outcomes at Centers with Low Gastrectomy Volume.,"The relationship between hospital volume and surgical mortality is well documented. However, complete centralization of surgical care is not always feasible. The present study investigates how overall volume of upper gastrointestinal surgery at hospitals influences patient outcomes following resection for gastric adenocarcinoma. National Cancer Database (2010-2019) patients with pathologic stage 1-3 gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent gastrectomy were identified. Three cohorts were created: low-volume hospitals (LVH) for both gastrectomy and overall upper gastrointestinal operations, mixed-volume hospital (MVH) for low-volume gastrectomy but high-volume overall upper gastrointestinal operations, and high-volume gastrectomy hospitals (HVH). Chi-squared tests were used to analyze sociodemographic factors and surgical outcomes and Kaplan-Meier method for survival analysis. In total, 26,398 patients were identified (LVH: 20,099; MVH: 539; HVH: 5,760). The 5-year survival was equivalent between MVH and HVH for all stages of disease (MVH: 56.0%, HVH 55.6%; p = 0.9866) and when stratified into early (MVH: 69.9%, HVH: 65.4%; p = 0.1998) and late stages (MVH: 24.7%, HVH: 32.0%; p = 0.1480), while LVH had worse survival. After matching patients, postoperative outcomes were worse for LVH, but there was no difference between MVH and HVH in terms of adequate lymphadenectomy, margin status, readmission rates, and 90-day mortality rates. Despite lower gastrectomy volume for cancer, postoperative gastrectomy outcomes at centers that perform a high number of upper gastrointestinal cancer surgeries were similar to hospitals with high gastrectomy volume. These hospitals offer a blueprint for providing equivalent outcomes to high volume centers while enhancing availability of quality cancer care.",['Romatoski KS; de Geus SWL; Miriyam B; Chung SH; Kenzik K; Papageorge MV; Rasic G; Ng SC; Tseng JF; Sachs TE'],2024,study investigates how overall volume of upper gastrointestinal surgery at hospitals influences patient outcomes following resection for gastric adenocarcinoma. three cohorts were created: low-volume hospitals (LVH) for both gastrectomy and overall upper gastrointestinal operations. mixed-volume hospital (MVH) for low-volume gastrectomy but high-volume overall upper gastrointestinal operations.
The emotional boundary seesaw model to help cancer clinical nurse specialists work with patients who challenge them.,"Receiving a diagnosis of cancer and receiving treatment can be physically and psychologically onerous for cancer patients. Alongside their nursing skills, cancer clinical nurse specialists (CCNSs) are trained to provide psychological support, assessment and intervention following a cancer diagnosis. Mental health specialists, usually clinical psychologists, provide clinical supervision to CCNSs to support them with this. One of the regular themes that comes up in clinical supervision with CCNSs is how to maintain a supportive and therapeutic relationship with 'challenging' patients. These patients may be considered challenging because they are inconsistent, demanding or ambivalent about their care, which puts a strain on the relationship with their CCNS. By using the emotional seesaw model to reflect on and attend to the emotional boundaries of the relationship, within clinical supervision, these challenging relationships can be understood and managed, and better outcomes for the patient can be achieved.",['Lorentz I'],2024,"CCNSs are trained to provide psychological support, assessment and intervention. mental health specialists provide clinical supervision to CCNSs.

Long-Term Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter and Fasting Blood Glucose and Diabetes in 20 Million Chinese Women of Reproductive Age.,"Evidence of the associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and diabetes risk from women of reproductive age, in whom diabetes may have adverse long-term health effects for both themselves and future generations, remains scarce. We therefore examined the associations of long-term PM2.5 exposure with fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and diabetes risk in women of reproductive age in China. This study included 20,076,032 women age 20-49 years participating in the National Free Preconception Health Examination Project in China between 2010 and 2015. PM2.5 was estimated using a satellite-based model. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of PM2.5 exposure with FBG level and diabetes risk, respectively. Diabetes burden attributable to PM2.5 was estimated using attributable fraction (AF) and attributable number. PM2.5 showed monotonic relationships with elevated FBG level and diabetes risk. Each interquartile range (27 μg/m3) increase in 3-year average PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.078-mmol/L (95% CI 0.077, 0.079) increase in FBG and 18% (95% CI 16%, 19%) higher risk of diabetes. The AF attributed to PM2.5 exposure exceeding 5 μg/m3 was 29.0% (95% CI 27.5%, 30.5%), corresponding to an additional 78.6 thousand (95% CI 74.5, 82.6) diabetes cases. Subgroup analyses showed more pronounced diabetes risks in those who were overweight or obese, age >35 years, less educated, of minority ethnicity, registered as a rural household, and residing in western China. We found long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher diabetes risk in women of reproductive age in China.",['Shen Y; Jiang L; Xie X; Meng X; Xu X; Dong J; Yang Y; Xu J; Zhang Y; Wang Q; Shen H; Zhang Y; Yan D; Zhou L; Jiang Y; Chen R; Kan H; Cai J; He Y; Ma X'],2024,"study included 20,076,032 women aged 20-49 years participating in the national free preconception health examination project in china between 2010 and 2015. a satellite-based model was used to examine the associations of PM2.5 exposure with FBG level and diabetes risk."
Mushrooms and Fungi and Their Biological Compounds with Antidiabetic Activity: A Review.,"Mushrooms have been used by humans for centuries as food and medicine because they have been shown to affect certain diseases. Mushrooms for medicinal purposes have been consumed in the form of extracts and/or biomass of the mycelium or fruiting body. The beneficial health effects of mushrooms are due to their content of bioactive compounds (polysaccharides, proteins, ergosterol, lectins, etc.). On the other hand, diabetes is one of the metabolic diseases that affects the population worldwide, characterized by hyperglycemia that involves a defective metabolism of insulin, a hormone secreted by β cells and that mainly stimulates glucose absorption by the cells. However, it also affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins; poor control of this disease leads to serious damage to eyesight, kidneys, bones, heart, skin, blood vessels, nerves, etc. It has been reported that the consumption of some mushrooms helps control and treat diabetes, since among other actions, they promote the secretion of insulin by the pancreas, help reduce blood glucose and have α-glucosidase inhibitory activity which improves glucose uptake by cells, which are effects that prescription medications have for patients with diabetes. In that sense, this manuscript shows a review of scientific studies that support the abilities of some mushrooms to be used in the control and/or treatment of diabetes.",['Téllez-Téllez M; Diaz-Godinez G'],2024,mushrooms have been used by humans for centuries as food and medicine. they have been shown to affect certain diseases. diabetes is one of the metabolic diseases that affects the population worldwide.
Vitamin D and bone health: What vitamin D can and cannot do.,"Historically vitamin D deficiency had devastating consequences for children causing rickets resulting in severe bone deformities often leading to death. The mystery of the cause of rickets finally came to light when it was observed that cod liver oil and sunlight could prevent and cure rickets. The first vitamin D to be discovered was vitamin D<sub>2</sub> from ergosterol in ultraviolet irradiated yeast. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> was discovered from UV exposure to the skin. Investigations revealed the two major functions of vitamin D were to increase intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption and mobilize calcium from the skeleton to maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. Later studies demonstrated that vitamin D does not have an active role in bone mineralization. Vitamin D deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism increasing bone resorption. As a result, this decreases bone mineral content and compromises the architectural integrity increasing risk for fracture. Vitamin D deficiency has also been shown to enhance aging of the bone causing cracks and enhancing bone fractures. Vitamin D deficiency also causes osteomalacia. Therefore, vitamin D sufficiency is extremely important to maximize bone health throughout life. It helps to prevent bone loss, but it cannot restore bone loss due to increased bone resorption that can occur under a variety of circumstances including menopause. The Endocrine Society Guidelines recommends for all ages that adequate vitamin D obtained from the sun, foods and supplements is necessary in order to maintain a circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D of at least 30 ng/mL for maximum bone health.",['Holick MF'],2024,first vitamin to be discovered was vitamin Dsub>2/sub> from ergosterol in ultraviolet irradiated yeast. vitamin D deficiency also causes osteomalacia.
Isolation of Nuclei from Human Intermuscular Adipose Tissue and Downstream Single-Nuclei RNA Sequencing.,"Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a relatively understudied adipose depot located between muscle fibers. IMAT content increases with age and BMI and is associated with metabolic and muscle degenerative diseases; however, an understanding of the biological properties of IMAT and its interplay with the surrounding muscle fibers is severely lacking. In recent years, single-cell and nuclei RNA sequencing have provided us with cell type-specific atlases of several human tissues. However, the cellular composition of human IMAT remains largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges of its accessibility from biopsy collection in humans. In addition to the limited amount of tissue collected, the processing of human IMAT is complicated due to its proximity to skeletal muscle tissue and fascia. The lipid-laden nature of the adipocytes makes it incompatible with single-cell isolation. Hence, single nuclei RNA sequencing is optimal for obtaining high-dimensional transcriptomics at single-cell resolution and provides the potential to uncover the biology of this depot, including the exact cellular composition of IMAT. Here, we present a detailed protocol for nuclei isolation and library preparation of frozen human IMAT for single nuclei RNA sequencing. This protocol allows for the profiling of thousands of nuclei using a droplet-based approach, thus providing the capacity to detect rare and low-abundant cell types.",['Elingaard-Larsen LO; Whytock KL; Divoux A; Hopf M; Kershaw EE; Justice JN; Goodpaster BH; Lane NE; Sparks LM'],2024,"intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is a relatively understudied adipose depot located between muscle fibers.

Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Groin Node Metastases Following Surgery for Vulvar Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"<b>Background:</b> Lymph node metastasis in vulvar cancer is a critical prognostic factor associated with higher recurrence and decreased survival. A survival benefit is reported with adjuvant radiotherapy but with potential significant morbidity. We aim to clarify whether there is high-quality evidence to support the use of adjuvant radiotherapy in this setting. <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant radiotherapy to locoregional metastatic nodal areas. <b>Search Methods:</b> We conducted a comprehensive and systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the National Cancer Institute. We considered only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). <b>Main Results:</b> We identified 1,760 records and finally retrieved only one eligible RCT (114 participants with positive inguinofemoral lymph nodes). All women had undergone radical vulvectomy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy and had been randomized to adjuvant radiotherapy or to intraoperative ipsilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy. At 6 years, the overall survival (OS) was 51% versus 41% in favor of radiotherapy (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.30-1.3) without significance and with very low certainty of evidence. At 6 year, the cumulative incidence of cancer-related deaths was 29% versus 51% in favor of adjuvant radiotherapy (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.28-0.87). Recurrence-free survival at 6 years was 59% after adjuvant radiotherapy versus 48% after pelvic lymphadenectomy (HR 0.39; 95% CI 0.17-0.88). Three (5.3%) versus 13 (24.1%) groin recurrences were noted, respectively, in the adjuvant radiotherapy and pelvic lymphadenectomy groups. There was no significant difference in acute toxicities for pelvic lymphadenectomy compared to radiotherapy. In women with positive pelvic lymph nodes (20%), the OS at 6 year was 36% compared with 13% in favor of adjuvant radiotherapy. Late cutaneous toxicity rate appeared to be greater after radiotherapy (19% vs. 15%) but with less chronic lymphedema (16% vs. 22%). <b>Conclusion:</b> There is only very low-quality evidence on administering adjuvant radiotherapy for inguinal lymph node metastases. Although the identified study was a multicenter RCT, there was a reasonable imprecision and inconsistency because of small study numbers, wide confidence intervals in the data, and early trial closure, resulting in downgrading of the evidence.",['Ferrari F; Ismail L; Sabbagh A; Hardern K; Owens R; Gozzini E; Soleymani Majd H'],2024,a survival benefit is reported with adjuvant radiotherapy but with potential significant morbidity. the aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant radiotherapy to locoregional metastatic nodal areas.
Melatonin restores hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis disrupted by blue light at night in high-fat diet-fed mice.,"Artificial light at night (ALAN) is an emerging environmental pollutant that threatens public health. Recently, ALAN has been identified as a risk factor for obesity; however, the role of ALAN and its light wavelength in hepatic lipid metabolic homeostasis remains undetermined. We showed that chronic dim (~5 lx) ALAN (dLAN) exposure significantly promoted hepatic lipid accumulation in obese or diabetic mice, with the most severe effect of blue light and little effect of green or red light. These metabolic phenotypes were attributed to blue rather than green or red dLAN interfering with hepatic lipid metabolism, especially lipogenesis and lipolysis. Further studies found that blue dLAN disrupted hepatic lipogenesis and lipolysis processes by inhibiting hepatic REV-ERBs. Mechanistically, feeding behavior mediated the regulation of dLAN on hepatic REV-ERBs. In addition, different effects of light wavelengths at night on liver REV-ERBs depended on the activation of the corticosterone (CORT)/glucocorticoid receptor (GR) axis. Blue dLAN could activate the CORT/GR axis significantly while other wavelengths could not. Notably, we demonstrated that exogenous melatonin could effectively inhibit hepatic lipid accumulation and restore the hepatic GR/REV-ERBs axis disrupted by blue dLAN. These findings demonstrate that dLAN promotes hepatic lipid accumulation in mice via a short-wavelength-dependent manner, and exogenous melatonin is a potential therapeutic approach. This study strengthens the relationship between ALAN and hepatic lipid metabolism and provides insights into directing ambient light.",['Guan Q; Wang Z; Cao J; Dong Y; Tang S; Chen Y'],2024,artificial light at night (ALAN) is emerging environmental pollutant. recent exposure to dLAN significantly promoted hepatic lipid accumulation in obese or diabetic mice. blue dLAN disrupted hepatic lipogenesis and lipolysis processes.
"The lysosomal trafficking regulator ""LYST"": an 80-year traffic jam.","Lysosomes and lysosome related organelles (LROs) are dynamic organelles at the intersection of various pathways involved in maintaining cellular hemostasis and regulating cellular functions.

Recent advances in paclitaxel biosynthesis and regulation.,"Paclitaxel (PTX) is a high value plant natural product (PNP) derived from Taxus (yew) species. This plant secondary metabolite (PSM) and its derivatives constitute a cornerstone for the treatment of an increasing variety of cancers. New applications for PTX also continue to emerge, further promoting demand for this WHO designated essential medicine. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of PTX biosynthesis and its cognate regulation, which have been enabled by the development of transcriptomic approaches and the recent sequencing and annotation of three Taxus genomes. Collectively, this has resulted in the elucidation of two functional gene sets for PTX biosynthesis, unlocking new potential for the use of heterologous hosts to produce PTX. Knowledge of the PTX pathway also provides a valuable resource for understanding the regulation of this key PSM. Epigenetic regulation of PSM in plant cell culture (PCC) is a major concern for PTX production, given the loss of PSM production in long-term cell cultures.

Disruption of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) has been implicated in metabolic disorders and cancer. However, the role of SQLE as a monooxygenase involved in oxidative stress remains unclear. We analyzed the expression and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and LUSC samples from GEO and TCGA databases. The proliferative activity of the tumors after intervention of SQLE was verified by cell and animal experiments. JC-1 assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot were used to show changes in apoptosis after intervention of SQLE. Flow cytometry and fluorescence assay of ROS levels were used to indicate oxidative stress status. We investigated the unique role of SQLE expression in the diagnosis and prognosis prediction of LUSC. Knockdown of SQLE or treatment with the SQLE inhibitor terbinafine can suppress the proliferation of LUSC cells by inducing apoptosis and reactive oxygen species accumulation. However, depletion of SQLE also results in the impairment of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis resistance such as upregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. Therefore, prevention of SQLE in synergy with glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL3 effectively mitigates the proliferation and growth of LUSC. Our study indicates that the low expression of SQLE employs adaptive survival through regulating the balance of apoptosis and ferroptosis resistance. In future, the combinational therapy of targeting SQLE and ferroptosis could be a promising approach in treating LUSC.",['Li G; Chen L; Bai H; Zhang L; Wang J; Li W'],2024,LUSC lacks effective targeted therapies and has poor prognosis. squalene epoxidase (SQLE) has been implicated in metabolic disorders and cancer. but the role of SQLE as a monooxygenase involved in oxidative stress remains unclear.
Association between postoperative hyperactive delirium and major complications in elderly patients undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery: A large-scale cohort study.,"This cohort study aimed to explore the connection between postoperative hyperactive delirium and major complications in elderly patients undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery. Elderly patients aged 65 years and older undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery were included in the study. The presence of postoperative hyperactive delirium was assessed, and logistic regression analysis, following propensity score matching, was conducted to investigate the association between postoperative hyperactive delirium and major complications occurring 30 and 90 days post-surgery. The analysis controlled for potential confounding factors. After propensity score matching, the analysis included 13 590 patients, equally distributed with 6795 in each group. The group experiencing postoperative hyperactive delirium exhibited a significantly elevated risk of 30-day postoperative complications, including acute renal failure, pneumonia, septicemia, and stroke, with adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.64 to 2.39. Furthermore, this group displayed notably higher rates of 90-day postoperative complications, encompassing mortality, acute renal failure, pneumonia, septicemia, and stroke, with a significantly increased incidence of mortality within 90 days. Postoperative hyperactive delirium in elderly patients undergoing emergency hip fracture surgery is significantly linked to an increased risk of major complications at both 30 and 90 days post-surgery. These findings underscore the critical importance of delirium prevention and management in this patient population, offering the potential to reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications.

Open questions on basal insulin therapy in T2D: a Delphi consensus.,"The revolution in the therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) requires a rethinking of the positioning of basal insulin (BI) therapy. Given the considerable number of open questions, a group of experts was convened with the aim of providing, through a Delphi consensus method, practical guidance for doctors. A group of 6 experts developed a series of 29 statements on: the role of metabolic control in light of the most recent guidelines; BI intensification strategies: (1) add-on versus switch; (2) inertia in starting and titrating; (3) free versus fixed ratio combination; basal-bolus intensification and de-intensification strategies; second generation analogues of BI (2BI). A panel of 31 diabetologists, by accessing a dedicated website, assigned each statement a relevance score on a 9-point scale. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants. Panelists showed agreement for all 29 statements, of which 26 were considered relevant, one was considered not relevant and two were of uncertain relevance. Panelists agreed that the availability of new classes of drugs often allows the postponement of BI and the simplification of therapy. It remains essential to promptly initiate and titrate BI when required. BI should always, unless contraindicated, be started in addition to, and not as a replacement, for ongoing treatments with cardiorenal benefits. 2BIs should be preferred for their pharmacological profile, greater ease of self-titration and flexibility of administration. In a continuously evolving scenario, BI therapy still represents an important option in the management of T2D patients.",['Buzzetti R; Candido R; Esposito K; Giaccari A; Mannucci E; Nicolucci A; Russo GT'],2024,a group of experts developed 29 statements on the role of metabolic control. the BI intensification strategy was adopted by a panel of 31 diabetologists. the BI intensification strategy was adopted to assess the existence of disagreement among participants.
Augmented gut hormone response to feeding in older adults exhibiting low appetite.,"Age-related changes in gut hormones may play a role in anorexia of ageing. The aim of this study was to determine concentrations of ghrelin, PYY, and GLP-1 in older adults exhibiting an anorexia of ageing phenotype. Thirteen older adults with healthy appetite (OA-HA; 8f, 75±7 years, 26.0±3.2 kg·m<sup>-2</sup>), fifteen older adults with low appetite (OA-LA; 10f, 72±7 years, 23.6±3.1 kg·m<sup>-2</sup>), and twelve young adults (YA; 6f, 22±2 years, 24.4±2.0 kg·m<sup>-2</sup>) completed the study. Healthy appetite and low appetite were determined based on BMI, habitual energy intake, self-reported appetite, and laboratory-assessed ad libitum lunch intake. Participants provided a fasted measure of subjective appetite and blood sample (0 minutes) before consuming a standardised breakfast (450 kcal). Appetite was measured and blood samples were drawn throughout a 240-minute rest period. At 240 minutes, an ad libitum lunch meal was consumed. Relative intake at lunch (expressed as percentage of estimated total energy requirement) was lower for OA-LA (19.8±7.7%) than YA (41.5±9.2%, p<0.001) and OA-HA (37.3±10.0%, p<0.001). Ghrelin suppression was greater for OA-LA (net AUC, -78719±74788 pg·mL<sup>-1</sup>·240min<sup>-1</sup>) than both YA (-23899±27733 pg·mL<sup>-1</sup>·240min<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.016) and OA-HA (-21144±31161 pg·mL<sup>-1</sup>·240min<sup>-1</sup>, p=0.009). There were trends for higher GLP-1 concentrations in OA-LA compared with YA at 90 minutes (8.85±10.4 pM vs. 1.88±4.63 pM, p=0.073) and 180 minutes (5.00±4.71 pM vs. 1.07±2.83 pM, p=0.065). There was a trend for a greater PYY response for OA-LA compared with OA-HA (net AUC p=0.062). ""Anorexigenic response score"" - a composite score of gut hormone responses to feeding - showed greater anorexigenic response in OA-LA, compared with YA and OA-HA.

Feasibility of perforator flaps in Day surgery. A retrospective study through a two-years' experience.,"Day surgery is developing and its popularity is increasing for a variety of reasons: economic constraints, changes in professional practices, a greater adhesion of the patient. In an era of progress in surgical procedures, pedicled-perforator flaps reducing donor site morbidity and avoiding micro-anastomosis could take their place in Day surgery if planned and managed by an experienced team. In the period January 2019 to January 2021, we performed perforator flaps for soft tissue coverage in ambulatory setting. The patients were included retrospectively and data were collected by reviewing the medical records. Major and minor complications were recorded. The retrospective cohort included 32 surgical procedures in 32 patients. In all cases, perforator flaps were realized for resurfacing soft tissue defects consequent to oncodermatology surgery (84.3%), soft tissue sarcoma surgery (12.5%), invasive ductal breast carcinoma (3.1%). Major complications needing a surgical revision overcame 3/32 times (9.4%). In these cases, a failure requiring the drop off the flap overcame once. The average wound healing time was of 33 days (15-90) and the mean duration of follow-up was 9.6 months (1-22). The low complication rate in our series suggests that this first experience on perforator flaps in outpatient surgery is promising in terms of safety and feasibility.

A review for non-antibiotic treatment of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>: new insight.,"Gastric ulcers and gastric cancer are brought on by the <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> bacteria, which colonizes under the stomach mucous membrane. Different medication regimens are used to remove it, but the illness returns and becomes more resistant, which lowers the treatment rates. Additionally, this bacterium now exhibits a skyrocketing level of multi-drug resistance, necessitating recurrent therapeutic treatments. The negative effects of synthetic medications in comparison to conventional therapies are another significant factor in favor of non-pharmacological therapy. The most significant side effects of popular anti-gastric ulcer medications include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Stomach ulcers have previously been treated with herbal remedies and complementary treatments like probiotics. When probiotics are ingested, the host experiences several advantages that may be brought about by altering the bacterial flora in the digestive system. Additionally, stronger-acting chemical compounds and plant extracts can be employed to treat patients. In this article, we look at the substances and medications that are utilized in place of synthetic stomach ulcer-curing treatments.",['Shadvar N; Akrami S; Mousavi Sagharchi SM; Askandar RH; Merati A; Aghayari M; Kaviani N; Afkhami H; Kashfi M'],2024,"gastric ulcers and cancer are brought on by the i>Helicobacter pylori/i> bacteria. different medication regimens are used to remove it, but the illness returns and becomes more resistant. negative effects of synthetic medications are another significant factor in favor of non-pharmacological therapy."
Expression of CD4+ and CD8+ Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Their Relationship With Clinicopathological Parameters: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Background Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignant neoplasm of the oral cavity. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic ecosystem composed of components contributed by both the tumor and the host. The immune cells of TME, mainly CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), suppress the proliferation of cancer cells and play a crucial role in the progression of OSCC. The present study aims to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs in OSCC and to compare and correlate them with clinicopathological parameters. Methodology A total of 75 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of cases diagnosed with primary OSCC were immunostained with CD4+ and CD8+ antibodies and their expression was compared with the clinicopathological parameters. Results There was a significant positive correlation between CD4+ and CD8+ expression (r = 0.655, p = 0.001). Both CD4+ (r = -2.37, p = 0.041) and CD8+ (r = -0.348, p = 0.002) expressions negatively correlated with the TNM stage (r = -2.37, p = 0.041) of OSCC. CD8+ expression positively correlated with histopathological grade (r = 0.288, p = 0.012). Conclusions The study findings suggest that CD4+ cells are essential to maintain and sustain CD8+ TIL-mediated anti-tumor response. CD4+ and CD8+ TILs are key players in cell-mediated adaptive immunity and prevent tumor progression and metastasis. Strikingly, the higher grade of tumors despite heavy CD8+ infiltration may possibly be due to cancer immunoediting.",['Jeyapriya SM; Mohan AM; Kumar MS; Nirmal RM'],2024,tumor microenvironment is a dynamic ecosystem composed of components contributed by both the tumor and the host. the immune cells of TME suppress the proliferation of cancer cells.
Ultra rapid lispro improves postprandial glucose control versus lispro in combination with basal insulin: a study based on CGM in type 2 diabetes in China.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of URLi (ultra rapid lispro insulin) compared to insulin lispro as bolus insulin with basal insulin using CGM in the individuals with type 2 diabetes(T2D) in China. This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective, phase 3 study. Subjects with uncontrolled T2D were recruited and randomized 1:2 into the insulin lispro and URLi groups. Subjects received a consistent basal insulin regimen during the study and self-administered insulin lispro or URLi before each meal throughout the treatment period. Subjects underwent a 3-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) at the baseline and endpoint respectively, and then CGM data were analyzed. The primary endpoint was to compare the difference in postprandial glucose (PPG) control using CGM between the two groups. A total of 57 subjects with T2D completed the study. Our CGM data showed that postprandial glucose excursions after breakfast (BPPGE) in the URLi group was lower than that in the insulin lispro group (1.59 ± 1.57 mmol/L vs 2.51 ± 1.73 mmol/L, p = 0.046). 1-hour PPG was observed to decrease more in the URLi group than that in the insulin lispro group (-1.37 ± 3.28 mmol/L vs 0.24 ± 2.58 mmol/L, p = 0.047). 2-hour PPG was observed to decrease more in the URLi group than that in the insulin lispro group (-1.12 ± 4.00 mmol/L vs 1.22 ± 2.90 mmol/L, p = 0.021). The mean HbA1c level decreased by 1.1% in the URLi group and 0.99% in the insulin lispro group, with no treatment difference (p = 0.642). In the CGM profile, TBR was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.743). The weight gain also did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.303). URLi can control breakfast PPG better than insulin lispro in adults with T2D in China, while it is non-inferior in improving HbA1c. The incidence of hypoglycemic and weight gain were similar between the two groups.",['Yuan L; Luo Y; Luo Y; Ding B; Zhang P; Ma J; Wu J'],2024,57 subjects with T2D completed the study. 1-hour PPG was observed to decrease more in the URLi group. bolus insulin was compared to insulin lispro as bolus insulin.
LncRNAs in Immune and Stromal Cells Remodel Phenotype of Cancer Cell and Tumor Microenvironment.,"Emerging studies suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the mutual regulation of cells in tumor microenvironment, thereby affecting the anti-tumor immune activity of immune cells. Additionally, the intracellular pathways mediated by lncRNAs can affect the expression of immune checkpoints or change the cell functions, including cytokines secretion, of immune and stromal cells in tumor microenvironment, which further influences cancer patients' prognosis and treatment response. With the in-depth research, lncRNAs have shown great potency as a new immunotherapy target and predict immunotherapy response. The research on lncRNAs provides us with a new insight into developing new immunotherapy drugs and predicting the outcome of immunotherapy. With development of RNA sequencing technology, amounts of lncRNAs were found to be dysregulated in immune and stromal cells rather than tumor cells. These lncRNAs function through ceRNA network or regulating transcript factor activity, thus leading abnormal differentiation and activation of immune and stromal cells. Here, we review the function of lncRNAs in the immune microenvironment and focus on the alteration of lncRNAs in immune and stromal cells, and discuss how these alterations affect tumor growth, metastasis and treatment response.",['Li W; Zhang H; You Z; Guo B'],2024,long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the mutual regulation of cells in tumor microenvironment. intracellular pathways mediated by lncRNAs can affect the expression of immune checkpoints. lncRNAs have shown great potency as a new immunotherapy target and predict immunotherapy response.
"Chelating mitochondrial iron and copper: Recipes, pitfalls and promise.","Iron and copper chelation therapy plays a crucial role in treating conditions associated with metal overload, such as hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease. However, conventional chelators face challenges in reaching the core of iron and copper metabolism - the mitochondria. Mitochondria-targeted chelators can specifically target and remove metal ions from mitochondria, showing promise in treating diseases linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Additionally, they serve as specific mitochondrial metal sensors. However, designing these new molecules presents its own set of challenges. Depending on the chelator's intended use to prevent or to promote redox cycling of the metals, the chelating moiety must possess different donor atoms and an optimal value of the electrode potential of the chelator-metal complex. Various targeting moieties can be employed for selective delivery into the mitochondria.

Translation into Brazilian Portuguese and transcultural adaptation and validation of the treatment specific questionnaire Home Parenteral Nutrition- Quality of Life (HPN-QOL©).,"Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) is the main treatment for patients with chronic intestinal failure. It is commonly prescribed for nutritional recovery, survival increase and, whenever possible, improvement of quality of life. As there are no validated instruments in Brazilian Portuguese to be used in these patients, the objective of this study was to carry out the transcultural adaptation and validation of Home Parenteral Nutrition - Quality of life (HPN-QOL©) into Brazilian Portuguese. This observational and cross-sectional study was conducted at the multidisciplinary short-bowel syndrome clinic (AMULSIC) of the Hospital das Clínicas of the University of São Paulo Medical School (HC-FMUSP). A five-stage protocol was adopted for the transcultural adaptation: initial translation; synthesis; reverse translation; experts committee and pre-test. The adapted questionnaire was applied to a convenience (representative) sample (n = 16) and Cronbach's Alpha Coefficient, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Bland-Altman Test were submitted for the analysis of the internal consistency and intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. The transcultural adaptation was considered excellent (Content Validity Index = 100%). The internal consistency was satisfactory for most of the scales (16/19), and α > 0.70 was 84.21%. ICC values revealed high intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility in most of the scales. No significant difference was observed between intraobservers and interobservers in any of the questions (p > 0.05). The questionnaire was shown as adapted and valid for use in Brazil.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 upregulation in urinary extracellular vesicles from proximal tubules of type 2 diabetic rats.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major cause of chronic kidney disease. Microalbuminuria is currently the most common non-invasive biomarker for the early diagnosis of DN. However, renal structural damage may have advanced when albuminuria is detected. In this study, we sought biomarkers for early DN diagnosis through proteomic analysis of urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) from type 2 diabetic model rats and normal controls. Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) was significantly increased in uEVs from diabetic model rats at the early stage despite minimal differences in albuminuria between the groups. Calorie restriction significantly suppressed the increase in IDH1 in uEVs and 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, suggesting that the increase in IDH1 in uEVs was associated with the progression of DN. Additionally, we investigated the origin of IDH1-containing uEVs based on their surface sugar chains. Lectin affinity enrichment and immunohistochemical staining showed that IDH1-containing uEVs were derived from proximal tubules. These findings suggest that the increase in IDH1 in uEVs reflects pathophysiological alterations in the proximal tubules and that IDH1 in uEVs may serve as a potential biomarker of DN in the proximal tubules.",['Sei H; Hirade N; Kamiya K; Nakashima F; Yoshitake J; Kano K; Mishiro-Sato E; Kikuchi R; Uchida K; Shibata T'],2024,microalbuminuria is currently the most common non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis of DN. renal structural damage may have advanced when albuminuria is detected.
In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a tetrazine-conjugated poly-L-lysine effector molecule labeled with astatine-211.,"A significant challenge in cancer therapy lies in eradicating hidden disseminated tumor cells. Within Nuclear Medicine, Targeted Alpha Therapy is a promising approach for cancer treatment tackling disseminated cancer. As tumor size decreases, alpha-particles gain prominence due to their high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) and short path length. Among alpha-particle emitters, <sup>211</sup>At stands out with its 7.2 hour half-life and 100% alpha emission decay. However, optimizing the pharmacokinetics of radiopharmaceuticals with short lived radionuclides such as <sup>211</sup>At is pivotal, and in this regard, pretargeting is a valuable tool. This method involves priming the tumor with a modified monoclonal antibody capable of binding both the tumor antigen and the radiolabeled carrier, termed the ""effector molecule. This smaller, faster-clearing molecule improves efficacy. Utilizing the Diels Alder click reaction between Tetrazine (Tz) and Trans-cyclooctene (TCO), the Tz-substituted effector molecule combines seamlessly with the TCO-modified antibody. This study aims to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution of two Poly-L-Lysine-based effector molecule sizes (10 and 21 kDa), labelled with <sup>211</sup>At, and the in vitro binding of the most favorable polymer size, in order to optimize the pretargeted radioimmunotherapy with <sup>211</sup>At. In vivo results favor the smaller polymer's biodistribution pattern over the larger one, which accumulates in organs like the liver and spleen. This is especially evident when comparing the biodistribution of the smaller polymer to a directly labelled monoclonal antibody. The smaller variant also shows rapid and efficient binding to SKOV-3 cells preloaded with TCO-modified Trastuzumab in vitro, emphasizing its potential. Both polymer sizes showed equal or better in vivo stability of the astatine-carbon bond compared to a monoclonal antibody labelled with the same prosthetic group. Overall, the small Poly-L-Lysine-based effector molecule (10 kDa) holds the most promise for future research, exhibiting significantly lower uptake in the kidneys and spleen compared to the larger effector (21 kDa) while maintaining an in vivo stability of the astatine-carbon bond comparable to or better than intact antibodies. A proof of concept in vitro cell study demonstrates rapid reaction between the small astatinated effector and a TCO-labelled antibody, indicating the potential of this novel Poly-L-Lysine-based pretargeting system for further investigation in an in vivo tumor model.",['Timperanza C; Jensen H; Hansson E; Bäck T; Lindegren S; Aneheim E'],2024,a significant challenge in cancer therapy lies in eradicating hidden disseminated tumor cells. targeted Alpha therapy is a promising approach for cancer treatment. a new study aims to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution of two poly-L-Lysine-based effector molecule sizes.
"Melanocyte stem cells in the skin: Origin, biological characteristics, homeostatic maintenance and therapeutic potential.","Melanocyte stem cells (MSCs), melanocyte lineage-specific skin stem cells derived from the neural crest, are observed in the mammalian hair follicle, the epidermis or the sweat gland. MSCs differentiate into mature melanin-producing melanocytes, which confer skin and hair pigmentation and uphold vital skin functions. In controlling and coordinating the homeostasis, repair and regeneration of skin tissue, MSCs play a vital role. Decreased numbers or impaired functions of MSCs are closely associated with the development and therapy of many skin conditions, such as hair graying, vitiligo, wound healing and melanoma. With the advancement of stem cell technology, the relevant features of MSCs have been further elaborated. In this review, we provide an exhaustive overview of cutaneous MSCs and highlight the latest advances in MSC research.

PRR34-AS1 promotes mitochondrial division and glycolytic reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through upregulation of MIEF2.,"LncRNA PRR34-AS1 overexpression promotes the proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, but whether it affects HCC energy metabolism remains unclear. Mitochondrial division and glycolytic reprogramming play important roles in tumor development. In this study, the differential expression of PRR34-AS1 is explored via TCGA analysis, and higher levels of PRR34-AS1 are detected in patients with liver cancer than in healthy individuals. A series of experiments, such as CCK-8, PCR, and immunofluorescence staining, reveal that the proliferation, invasion, glycolysis, and mitochondrial division of PRR34-AS1-overexpressing hepatoma cells are significantly promoted. TCGA analysis and immunohistochemistry reveal high expression of the mitochondrial dynamin MIEF2 in liver cancer tissues. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirm that miR-498 targets and binds to mitochondrial elongation factor 2 (MIEF2). In addition, we show that PRR34-AS1 can sponge miR-498. Therefore, we further investigate the effects of the lncRNA PRR34-AS1/miR-498/MIEF2 axis on the growth, glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial division in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. A series of experiments are performed on hepatocellular carcinoma cells after different treatments. The results show that the proliferative activity, invasive ability, and glycolytic level of hepatocellular carcinoma cells are decreased in HCC cells with low PRR34-AS1 expression, and the miR-498 expression level is increased in these cells. Inhibition of miR-498 or overexpression of MIEF2 restored the proliferative activity, invasive ability, glycolysis, and mitochondrial division in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Thus, PRR34-AS1 regulates MIEF2 by sponging miR-498, thereby promoting mitochondrial division, mediating glycolytic reprogramming and ultimately driving the growth and invasion of HCC cells. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> mouse experiments yield results similar to those of the <i>in vitro</i> experiments, verifying the above results.",['Yang X; Feng H; Kim J; Ti G; Wang L; Wang K; Song D'],2024,TCGA analysis and immunohistochemistry reveal high expression of mitochondrial dynamin MIEF2 in liver cancer tissues. lncRNA PRR34-AS1 overexpression promotes proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
Association between Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure and Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,"The objective of this study was to examine whether there is an elevated risk of developing contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with high systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A total of 213 patients diagnosed with STEMI and who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled in the study. The patients were stratified into two groups based on the presence of CIN. Comparisons between these groups included an assessment of demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and risk factors. SPAP was calculated for each patient upon admission through echocardiography, and subsequent comparisons were performed between the groups. The distribution of the study population was as follows: 33 (15.5%) were CIN(+) and 180 (84.5%) were CIN(-). SPAP [odds ratio (OR) = 1.295, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.157-1.451, p < 0.001], and diabetes (OR = 1.241, 95% CI: 1.194-1.287, p = 0.013) were identified as independent factors associated with CIN development. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, SPAP above a cut-off level of 31.5 mmHg could determine the presence of CIN with a sensitivity of 91.0% and specificity of 90.0% (p < 0.001). SPAP on echocardiography is an independent predictor of the development of CIN in patients with STEMI.

Nerve Growth Factor and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor as Potential Biomarkers of Mirabegron Efficacy in Patients with Overactive Bladder Syndrome.,"Overactive Bladder Syndrome (OAB) significantly impacts quality of life, necessitating improved diagnostic tools and treatment monitoring. This study explores the potential of neurotrophins, nerve growth factor (NGF), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as urinary biomarkers in patients with OAB undergoing mirabegron therapy, a β3-adrenergic agonist. This investigation is aimed at providing insights into the potential of neurotrophins to enhance OAB diagnosis and assess treatment efficacy. Urinary NGF and BDNF levels were measured in 15 healthy controls and 30 patients with OAB. Patients were treated with mirabegron 50 mg once daily. Urinary NGF and BDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method and normalized by urinary creatinine levels (NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre). The urinary NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels were compared between controls and patients with OAB and subsequently at baseline and 3 months after mirabegron treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed with the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS) questionnaire. Urinary NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels were significantly higher in patients with OAB than in the controls (p < 0.001 and p = 0.03 respectively). Moreover, NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels significantly decreased post-mirabegron treatment (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005 respectively). Patients with improvement of OAB symptoms after treatment showed lower levels of NGF/Cre at the 3-month evaluation than those with no improvement (p = 0.05). Although both NGF/Cre and BDNF/Cre levels were significantly decreased after mirabegron treatment, only NGF/Cre levels were associated with treatment response.",['Beta A; Giannouli A; Rizos D; Mantzou A; Deligeoroglou E; Bakas P'],2024,"u.s. study explores potential of neurotrophins, nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as urinary biomarkers in patients with OAB undergoing mirabegron therapy. u.s. embassy in sydney, sydney, is a'sea-like' u.s. hospital."
Pathologic TDP-43 downregulates myelin gene expression in the monkey brain.,"Growing evidence indicates that non-neuronal oligodendrocyte plays an important role in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases. In patient's brain, the impaired myelin structure is a pathological feature with the observation of TDP-43 in cytoplasm of oligodendrocyte. However, the mechanism underlying the gain of function by TDP-43 in oligodendrocytes, which are vital for the axonal integrity, remains unclear. Recently, we found that the primate-specific cleavage of truncated TDP-43 fragments occurred in cytoplasm of monkey neural cells. This finding opened up the avenue to investigate the myelin integrity affected by pathogenic TDP-43 in oligodendrocytes. In current study, we demonstrated that the truncated TDP-35 in oligodendrocytes specifically, could lead to the dysfunctional demyelination in corpus callosum of monkey. As a consequence of the interaction of myelin regulatory factor with the accumulated TDP-35 in cytoplasm, the downstream myelin-associated genes expression was downregulated at the transcriptional level. Our study aims to investigate the potential effect on myelin structure injury, affected by the truncated TDP-43 in oligodendrocyte, which provided the additional clues on the gain of function during the progressive pathogenesis and symptoms in TDP-43 related diseases.",['Zhu L; Bai D; Wang X; Ou K; Li B; Jia Q; Tan Z; Liang J; He D; Yan S; Wang L; Li S; Li XJ; Yin P'],2024,non-neuronal oligodendrocyte plays an important role in ALS and other diseases. the mechanism underlying the gain of function by TDP-43 in oligodendrocytes remains unclear.
The role of elasticity on adhesion and clustering of neurons on soft surfaces.,"The question of whether material stiffness enhances cell adhesion and clustering is still open to debate. Results from the literature are seemingly contradictory, with some reports illustrating that adhesion increases with surface stiffness and others suggesting that the performance of a system of cells is curbed by high values of elasticity. To address the role of elasticity as a regulator in neuronal cell adhesion and clustering, we investigated the topological characteristics of networks of neurons on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces - with values of elasticity (E) varying in the 0.55-2.65 MPa range. Results illustrate that, as elasticity increases, the number of neurons adhering on the surface decreases. Notably, the small-world coefficient - a topological measure of networks - also decreases. Numerical simulations and functional multi-calcium imaging experiments further indicated that the activity of neuronal cells on soft surfaces improves for decreasing E. Experimental findings are supported by a mathematical model, that explains adhesion and clustering of cells on soft materials as a function of few parameters - including the Young's modulus and roughness of the material. Overall, results indicate that - in the considered elasticity interval - increasing the compliance of a material improves adhesion, improves clustering, and enhances communication of neurons.",['Marinaro G; Bruno L; Pirillo N; Coluccio ML; Nanni M; Malara N; Battista E; Bruno G; De Angelis F; Cancedda L; Di Mascolo D; Gentile F'],2024,results from literature suggest that adhesion increases with surface stiffness. others suggest that the performance of a system of cells is curbed by high values of elasticity.
Evaluation of the Factors Influencing Mortality in Patients with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis: A Multicenter Study of 166 Patients.,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening acute mucocutaneous disorders usually triggered by drugs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the factors affecting mortality in patients with SJS-TEN. Our study is a retrospective cohort study, analyzing data collected from a total of 12 tertiary care centers between April 2012 and April 2022. The study included 59 males and 107 females, a total of 166 patients, with an average age of 50.91 ± 21.25 years. Disease classification was TEN in 50% of cases, SJS in 33.1%, and SJS-TEN overlap in 16.9%. The average SCORTEN within the first 24 h was 2.44 ± 1.42. Supportive care was provided to 99.4% of patients. The most commonly used systemic immunomodulatory treatments were systemic steroids (84.3%), IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) (49.3%), and cyclosporine (38.6%). Plasmapheresis was administered to five patients. While 66.3% of patients were discharged, 24.1% resulted in exitus. Our comparative analysis of survivors and deceased patients found no effect of systemic steroids, IVIG, and cyclosporine treatments on mortality. Univariate analysis revealed that the SCORTEN scores on days 1 and 3 as well as the rates of detachment at the onset and during follow-up were significantly higher in deceased patients compared to survivors. The rates of fever, positive blood cultures, and systemic antibiotic use were higher in deceased patients compared to survivors. The presence of comorbidities, diabetes, and malignancy were significantly more common in deceased patients. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that over SCORTEN 2, the mortality risk exponentially rose with each SCORTEN increment, culminating in an 84-fold increase in mortality at SCORTEN 5-6 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 13.902-507.537, p < 0.001) compared to SCORTEN 0-1. Additionally, the utilization of plasmapheresis was associated with a 22-fold increase in mortality (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.96-247.2, p = 0.012). Our study found that a high SCORTEN score within the first 24 h and the use of plasmapheresis were related to increased mortality, while systemic steroids, IVIG, and cyclosporine treatments had no impact on mortality. We believe that data gathered from one of the most comprehensive studies which we conducted on SJS-TEN will enrich the literature, although additional research is warranted.",['Erduran F; Adışen E; Emre S; Hayran Y; Başkan EB; Yazıcı S; Bilgiç A; Alpsoy E; Günaydın SD; Elmas L; Akyol M; Güner R; Arıca DA; Aypek Y; Ergun T; Karavelioğlu D; Yazıcı AC; Aydoğan K; Bayramgürler D; Kıran R; Erdoğan HK; Acer E; Aktaş A'],2024,"a retrospective cohort study was conducted between April 2012 and April 2022. the study included 59 males and 107 females, a total of 166 patients. the average SCORTEN within the first 24 h was 2.44  1.42."
Small molecule drug discovery targeting the JAK-STAT pathway.,"The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway functions as a central hub for transmitting signals from more than 50 cytokines, playing a pivotal role in maintaining hematopoiesis, immune balance, and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various diseases, including immunodeficiency, autoimmune conditions, hematological disorders, and certain cancers. Proteins within this pathway have emerged as effective therapeutic targets for managing these conditions, with various approaches developed to modulate key nodes in the signaling process, spanning from receptor engagement to transcription factor activation. Following the success of JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib for RA treatment and ruxolitinib for managing primary myelofibrosis, the pharmaceutical industry has obtained approvals for over 10 small molecule drugs targeting the JAK-STAT pathway and many more are at various stages of clinical trials. In this review, we consolidate key strategies employed in drug discovery efforts targeting this pathway, with the aim of contributing to the collective understanding of small molecule interventions in the context of JAK-STAT signaling. We aspire that our endeavors will contribute to advancing the development of innovative and efficacious treatments for a range of diseases linked to this pathway dysregulation.",['Lv Y; Mi P; Babon JJ; Fan G; Qi J; Cao L; Lang J; Zhang J; Wang F; Kobe B'],2024,"the kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway functions as a central hub for transmitting signals from more than 50 cytokines. dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in various diseases, including immunodeficiency, autoimmune conditions, hematological disorders, and certain cancers."
Using a general practice research database to assess the spatio-temporal COVID-19 risk.,"In Flanders, general practitioners (GPs) were among the first ones to collect data regarding COVID-19 cases. Intego is a GPs' morbidity registry in primary care with data collected from the electronic medical records from a sample of general practices. The Intego database contain elaborate information regarding patient characteristics, such as comorbidities. At the national level, the Belgian Public Health Institute (Sciensano) recorded all test-confirmed COVID-19 cases, but without other patient characteristics. Spatio and spatio-temporal analyses were used to analyse the spread of COVID-19 incidence at two levels of spatial aggregation: the municipality and the health sector levels. Our study goal was to compare spatio-temporal modelling results based on the Intego and Sciensano data, in order to see whether the Intego database is capable of detecting epidemiological trends similar to those in the Sciensano data. Comparable results would allow researchers to use these Intego data, and their wealth of patient information, to model COVID-19-related processes. The two data sources provided comparable results. Being a male decreased the odds of having COVID-19 disease. The odds for the age categories (17,35], (35,65] and (65,110] of being a confirmed COVID-19 case were significantly higher than the odds for the age category [0,17]. In the Intego data, having one of the following comorbidities, i.e., chronic kidney disease, heart and vascular disease, and diabetes, was significantly associated with being a COVID-19 case, increasing the odds of being diagnosed with COVID-19. We were able to show how an alternative data source, the Intego data, can be used in a pandemic situation. We consider our findings useful for public health officials who plan intervention strategies aimed at monitor and control disease outbreaks such as that of COVID-19.",['Petrof O; Neyens T; Vaes B; Janssens A; Faes C'],2024,"inflanders, GPs were among the first to collect data regarding COVID-19 cases. the intego database contain elaborate information regarding patient characteristics, such as comorbidities."
High body mass index and triglyceride levels at health checkups increase the risk of new-onset chronic kidney disease and worsening renal function: the TAMA MED Project-CKD.,"Health checkups are important in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is not easily accompanied by subjective symptoms. CKD can be caused or aggravated by factors that have not yet been identified. This retrospective cohort study included 7 483 patients who underwent specific annual health checkups at a medical institution in Tama City, did not have CKD in 2012, and continued to undergo checkups (aged 40-74 years). We examined the risk factors for new-onset CKD and 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels among laboratory values from 2012 to 2020. Age, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride levels, atrial fibrillation, and medication for hypertension (HT) and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors for proteinuria, whereas current smoking, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and medication for HT were independent risk factors for estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. SBP, triglyceride levels and medication for HT were risk factors for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine levels during course of the study. The cut-off values of BMI for eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were 22.2 (men 24.7, women 22.1) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and fasting triglyceride levels for a 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine level were 171 (men 247, women 170) mg/dL, respectively.

IGF2BP2-modified circular RNA circCHD7 promotes endometrial cancer progression via stabilizing PDGFRB and activating JAK/STAT signaling pathway.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent a class of covalently closed, single-stranded RNAs and have been linked to cancer progression. N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation is a ubiquitous RNA modification in cancer cells. Increasing evidence suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A can mediate the effects of circRNAs in cancer biology. In contrast, the post-transcriptional systems of m<sup>6</sup>A and circRNA in the progression of endometrial cancer (EC) remain obscure. The current study identified a novel circRNA with m<sup>6</sup>A modification, hsa_circ_0084582 (circCHD7), which was upregulated in EC tissues. Functionally, circCHD7 was found to promote the proliferation of EC cells. Mechanistically, circCHD7 interacted with insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein (IGF2BP2) to amplify its enrichment. Moreover, circCHD7 increased the mRNA stability of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) in an m<sup>6</sup>A-dependent manner, thereby enhancing its expression. In addition, the circCHD7/IGF2BP2/PDGFRB axis activated the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and promoted EC cell proliferation. In conclusion, these findings provide new insights into the regulation of circRNA-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and the new ""circCHD7-PDGFRB"" model of regulation offers new perspectives on circCHD7 as a potential target for EC therapy.",['Shi R; Zhao R; Shen Y; Wei S; Zhang T; Zhang J; Shu W; Cheng S; Teng H; Wang H'],2024,"msup>6/sup>A is a ubiquitous RNA modification in cancer cells. circRNAs are a class of covalently closed, single-stranded RNAs. circRNAs are linked to cancer progression."
Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and Biomarkers in Culture-Positive and Culture-Negative Sepsis Patients.,"Sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and culture-negative sepsis, despite its prevalence, is largely understudied. The current study intends to examine clinical characteristics and biomarkers in culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis, focusing on 30-day mortality and duration of hospital stay in both groups.  Materials and methods: A prospective observational comparative cohort study was done on 150 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and wards of Jaipur Golden Hospital. Patients with documented fungal, viral, or parasitic infections, as well as those who had undergone surgery or experienced trauma, were excluded.  Results: The mean age of the patients was 51.31±18.94 years. Of 150 patients, 95 (63.3%) were culture-negative, whereas 55 (36.7%) were culture-positive, with more men in the former and more women in the latter. Patients with negative cultures had fewer comorbidities. The levels of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum lactate were within the prescribed limit for both culture-negative and positive patients. A higher proportion (87.3%) of the organisms isolated from culture-positive individuals were gram-negative, with <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) having the highest prevalence (27.3%), followed by <i>Klebsiella</i> (20%). There were 12.7% gram-positive isolates. The culture-negative patients had significantly better outcomes (P=0.003) as well as the duration of hospital stay (P<0.001) than the culture-positive patients. Culture-positive patients had a more severe illness, a higher incidence of septic shock, and a higher fatality rate than culture-negative patients. It can be concluded that CRP and PCT can be used as clinically reliable sepsis biomarkers in both culture-positive and culture-negative patients. The study found that culture-negative sepsis is more prevalent and that there are substantial differences between culture-negative and culture-positive sepsis, with the former group having fewer comorbidities, less severe illness, a shorter duration of hospital stays, lower death rates, and better outcomes.",['Goyal PK; Sinha S; Saraf P'],2024,culture-negative sepsis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. the current study intends to examine clinical characteristics and biomarkers in culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis.

Thus, we aimed to examine inequities in A1C over time, place, and individual characteristics, given known inequities across these indicators and the need to provide continued surveillance. Secondary de-identified data from medical claims from a single payer in Texas was merged with population health data. Generalized Estimating Equations were utilized to assess multiple years of data examining the likelihood of having non-target (>7% and ≥7%, two slightly different cut points based on different sources) and separately uncontrolled (>9%) A1C. Adults in Texas, with a Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) flag and with A1C reported in first quarter of the year using data from 2016 and 2019 were included in analyses. Approximately 50% had A1Cs within target ranges (<7% and ≤7%), with 50% considered having non-target (>7% and ≥7%) A1Cs; with 83% within the controlled ranges (≤9%) as compared to approximately 17% having uncontrolled (>9%) A1Cs. The likelihood of non-target A1C was higher among those individuals residing in rural (vs urban) areas (<i>P</i> < .0001); similar for the likelihood of reporting uncontrolled A1C, where those in rural areas were more likely to report uncontrolled A1C (<i>P</i> < .0001). In adjusted analysis, ACA enrollees in 2016 were approx. 5% more likely (OR = 1.049, 95% CI = 1.002-1.099) to have non-target A1C (≥7%) compared to 2019; in contrast non-ACA enrollees were approx. 4% more likely to have non-target A1C (≥7%) in <i>2019</i> compared to 2016 (OR = 1.039, 95% CI = 1.001-1.079). In adjusted analysis, ACA enrollees in 2016 were 9% more likely (OR = 1.093, 95% CI = 1.025-1.164) to have <i>uncontrolled</i> A1C compared to 2019; whereas there was no significant change among non-ACA enrollees.

Reduction of phosphorylated signal transducers and activator of transcription-5 expression in feline mammary carcinoma.,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) is a family of transcription factors involved in various normal physiological cellular processes. Moreover, STATs have been recently identified as novel therapeutic targets for various human tumors. STAT3, STAT5a, and STAT6 have been suggested to be involved in tumorigenesis in human breast cancer. Owing to the similarity between feline mammary carcinomas (FMCs) and human breast cancers, these factors may play an important role in FMCs. However, studies on the expression of STATs in animal tumors are limited. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to characterize the expression of total STAT5 (tSTAT5) and phosphorylated STAT5 (pSTAT5) in FMCs, feline mammary adenomas, non-neoplastic proliferative mammary gland lesions, and normal feline mammary glands using immunohistochemistry. High expression of tSTAT5 was observed in the cytoplasm of all the samples assessed in this study. Moreover, high expression of tSTAT5 was observed in the nucleus; however, its levels varied depending on the lesion. The percentage of pSTAT5-nuclear positive cells varied among normal feline mammary glands (40.1 ± 25.1%), and non-neoplastic lesions, including mammary hyperplasia (43.2 ± 28.6%) and fibroadenomatous changes (18.0 ± 13.6%). Moreover, the percentage of pSTAT5-nuclear-positive cells in feline mammary adenomas was 24.5 ± 19.2%, which was significantly reduced in feline mammary carcinomas (2.4 ± 5.6%), regardless of histopathological subtype. This study suggests that decreased STAT5 activity may be involved in the development and malignant progression of feline mammary carcinomas.",['Owaki K; Murakami M; Kato K; Hirata A; Sakai H'],2024,STATs have been recently identified as novel therapeutic targets for various human tumors. a similarity between feline mammary carcinomas and human breast cancers may play an important role in human breast cancers.
Nephrologists' perspectives and experiences with hospice among older adults with end-stage kidney disease.,"Hospice care leads to improved patient and family outcomes. Hospice use among older adults with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is markedly lower than among older adults with other serious illnesses, and the majority of those with ESKD who use hospice enroll in the last days of life. Here, our aim was to explore barriers to timely receipt of high-quality hospice care for older adults with ESKD. Utilizing a qualitative study design, we conducted a secondary analysis focused on hospice, a theme that we identified in our larger overarching study that involved semi-structured interviews with 20 nephrologists in the United States focused on treatment decision-making in older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease. We analyzed the interview transcripts using emergent thematic analysis to develop an understanding of barriers to high-quality hospice. With a couple notable exceptions, nephrologists voiced general support for the concept of hospice, but few recalled patients of theirs who had received hospice. Nephrologists' interviews revealed two interrelated contributors to the lack of timely access to high-quality hospice care for seriously ill older adults with ESKD: (1) nephrologists view dialysis and hospice as mutually exclusive models of care; (2) nephrologists feel unsure who should manage hospice care for patients with ESKD. The first contributor was rooted in nephrologists' narrow vision of when to consider hospice (informed, in part, by policy barriers) and, in a couple of cases, strong discomfort with hospice. The second stemmed from nephrologists' belief that neither they nor hospice are adequately prepared to provide hospice care for ESKD. Our findings suggest that, in addition to Medicare policy change, nephrologists need to receive more training in primary palliative care skills including in indications for hospice, initiating conversations about hospice with patients, and collaborating with hospice clinicians to care for these vulnerable patients.",['Wachterman MW; Sinha A; Leveille T; Waikar SS; Widera E; Romero K; Bokhour B'],2024,nephrologists interviewed 20 nephrologists in the united states. they found two interrelated contributors to lack of timely access to high-quality hospice care for older adults with ESKD. the first was rooted in nephrologists' narrow vision of when to consider hospice.

The incidence of eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia during lenalidomide therapy, and the requirement for high-dose steroids are not well-defined PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 44 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who were treated with lenalidomide therapy from August 2006 and March 2023. Eosinophilia (0.5-1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and hypereosinophilia (>1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) were observed in 6 patients (14%) and 4 patients (9%), respectively. The median duration of lenalidomide therapy was 6.5 months. Backward multivariate ordinary logistic regression identified higher absolute eosinophil count (OR, 4759.986; 95% CI, 11.223-2018772.073; P = .006) and longer duration of lenalidomide therapy (OR, 1.148; 95% CI, 1.012-1.302; P = .032) as independent prognostic factors for the incidence of eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia. There was a trend for a higher use of high-dose steroids with hypereosinophilia. The median time to develop the first occurrence hypereosinophilia was 0.5 months. Steroids were used in 40% of patients with eosinophilia or hypereosinophilia. All events resolved with discontinuation of lenalidomide and/or use of steroids. No long-tern lasting adverse effects were recorded. Lenalidomide may induce or worsen existing eosinophilia which may lead to the need for steroids within a month of therapy.",['Sasaki K; Kantarjian H; Montalban-Bravo G; Hammond D; Jabbour E; Kanagal-Shamanna R; Chien K; Garcia-Manero G'],2024,lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory therapy used to treat multiple hematologic malignancies. 44 patients were treated with lenalidomide therapy from august 2006 and march 2023. median duration of lenalidomide therapy was 6.5 months.
A Synthetic Circuit Empowering Reprogrammed B Cells for Therapeutic Proteins Expression Regulated by Tumor Detection.,"Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide, but immunotherapies hold promises to cure it by awaking the patient's immune system to provide long-term protection. Cell therapies, involving the infusion of immune cells, either directly or genetically modified, are being developed to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Here, we explored the potential of a new synthetic circuit to reprogram B cells to cure cancers. This circuit consists in a sensor (a membrane-anchored IgG1), a transducer (a fragment of the NR4A1 promoter) and an effector molecule. Upon recognition of its target, this sensor triggers signaling pathways leading to the activation of the transducer and to effector expression (here, a reporter molecule). We showed that this circuit could discriminate tumors expressing the target antigen from those that did not, in a dose dependent manner in vitro. Going further, we replaced the original membrane-anchored sensor by an immunoglobulin expression cassette that can not only be membrane-anchored but also be secreted depending on B-cell maturation status. This allowed concomitant activation of the circuit and secretion of transgenic antibodies directed against the targeted antigen. Of note, these antibodies could correctly bind their target and were recognized by FcR expressed at the surface of immune cells, which should synergically amplify the action of the effector. The potential of reprogrammed B cells remains to be assessed in vivo by implementing a therapeutic effector. In the future, B-cell reprogramming platforms should allow personalized cancer treatment by adapting both the sensor and the therapeutic effectors to patients.",['Page A; Delles M; Nègre D; Costa C; Fusil F; Cosset FL'],2024,"cells are being developed to recognize and destroy cancer cells. this circuit consists in a sensor, a transducer and an effector molecule. this circuit can discriminate tumors expressing the target antigen from those that did not, in a dose dependent manner in vitro."
"Knockdown of sulfotransferase 2B1 suppresses cell migration, invasion and promotes apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cells via targeting annexin A9.","Sulfotransferase family 2B member 1 (SULT2B1) has been reported to play oncogenic role in many types of cancers. Nevertheless, the role that SULT2B1 played in ovarian cancer (OC) and the hidden molecular mechanism is obscure. Expression of SULT2B1 in OC was analyzed by GEPIA database. qRT-PCR and western blot (WB) was applied for the appraisement of SULT2B1 and Annexin A9 (ANXA9) in OC cell lines. The capabilities of cells to proliferate, migrate and invade were assessed with CCK-8 assay, wound healing assay, along with transwell assay. Cell apoptotic level was estimated utilizing flow cytometry. WB was employed for the evaluation of migration- and apoptosis-related proteins. Bioinformatic analysis and co-immunoprecipitation were used to predict and verify the combination of SULT2B1 and ANXA9. The data showed that SULT2B1 and ANXA9 were upregulated in OC cells. SULT2B1 depletion suppressed the proliferative, migrative, and invasive capabilities of SKOV3 cells but facilitated the cell apoptosis. SULT2B1-regulated ANXA9 expression and were proved to bind to ANXA9. Additionally, ANXA9 deficiency exhibited the same impacts on cell migrative, invasive capability and apoptotic level as SULT2B1 silencing. Moreover, ANXA9 overexpression reversed the inhibitory impacts of SULT2B1 silencing on the proliferative, migrative, invasive, and apoptotic capabilities of SKOV3 cells. In summary, SULT2B1 silencing repressed OC progression by targeting ANXA9.",['Gao H; Xia M; Ruan H'],2024,"SULT2B1-regulated ANXA9 expression suppressed proliferative, migrative, and invasive capabilities of SKOV3 cells.

Toward interpretable and generalized mitosis detection in digital pathology using deep learning.,"The mitotic activity index is an important prognostic factor in the diagnosis of cancer. The task of mitosis detection is difficult as the nuclei are microscopic in size and partially labeled, and there are many more non-mitotic nuclei compared to mitotic ones. In this paper, we highlight the challenges of current mitosis detection pipelines and propose a method to tackle these challenges. Our proposed methodology is inspired from recent research on deep learning and an extensive analysis on the dataset and training pipeline. We first used the MiDoG'22 dataset for training, validation, and testing. We then tested the methodology without fine-tuning on the TUPAC'16 dataset and on a real-time case from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre. Our methodology has shown promising results both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitatively, our methodology achieved an F1-score of 0.87 on the MiDoG'22 dataset and an F1-score of 0.83 on the TUPAC dataset. Qualitatively, our methodology is generalizable and interpretable across various datasets and clinical settings. In this paper, we highlight the challenges of current mitosis detection pipelines and propose a method that can accurately predict mitotic nuclei. We illustrate the accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability of our approach across various datasets and clinical settings.

Pembrolizumab-induced type 1 diabetes.,"Immunotherapy has a crucial role in the current treatment of multiple malignancies. Albeit described as rare, new onset autoimmune diabetes is a potentially life-threatening complication of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, and its predisposing factors and pathological mechanism are yet to be clarified. We present a case of a 72-year-old man with a high-grade bladder carcinoma undergoing pembrolizumab treatment. He had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus but was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism four months after starting pembrolizumab. Two years after starting pembrolizumab, he presented in the emergency department due to abdominal pain, anorexia, polydipsia, polyuria and vomiting over the preceding five days and he met criteria for severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Three days prior to his admission, he had received prednisolone therapy for suspected hypersensitivity related to a contrast-enhanced imaging that he performed. Prompt treatment for DKA was started, with transition to insulin basal-bolus therapy after DKA resolution, with progressive glycaemic stabilization. Further investigation revealed low C-peptide levels (0.07 ng/dL, with a fasting blood glucose of 288 mg/dL), HbA1c 9.2% and positive anti-IA2 antibodies, which allowed the diagnosis of new-onset autoimmune diabetes. Pembrolizumab was transiently suspended, and the patient resumed treatment after glycaemic profile optimization under multiple daily insulin administrations two months later. This case highlights the importance of clinical suspicion and glycaemic monitoring as an integral part of treatment protocols in patients on pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additional research and investigation into the underlying mechanisms of this condition are necessary to identify potential screening tests for individuals at higher risk of developing DM and to guide the implementation of management and preventive strategies for ketoacidosis complication.",['Maia A; Soares DM; Azevedo S; Pereira T; Amaral C'],2024,"a 72-year-old man with a high-grade bladder carcinoma was undergoing pembrolizumab treatment. he had no personal or family history of diabetes mellitus but was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism four months after starting pembrolizumab. he met criteria for severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) three days prior to his admission, he had received prednisolone therapy for suspected hypersensitivity related to a contrast-enhanced"
Comparison of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy plus immunotherapy for locally resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (nCT + ICIs) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus immunotherapy (nCRT + ICIs) both induced favorable pathological response and tolerant toxicities for locally resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, few studies compared safety and efficacy between the two treatment strategies. This retrospective study collected clinical data of locally resectable ESCC patients who underwent nCT + ICIs or nCRT + ICIs followed by esophagectomy from November 2019 to December 2022. The incidence of adverse events, surgical outcomes, short and long-term efficacy, and treatment costs were compared. A total of 206 patients were included, with a ratio of 158:48 between nCT + ICIs group and nCRT + ICIs group. The two groups exhibited well-balanced baseline characteristics. Most adverse events were grade 1-2 in both groups. The nCT + ICIs group had a longer operative time (334.00 ± 170.2 min vs 279.60 ± 88.31 min, <i>P</i>=0.020) than nCRT + ICIs group, but there were no differences in surgical complications.

Intervention to promote adolescents' communication and engagement in diabetes clinic encounters: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"To conduct a pilot randomized trial of an intervention to improve adolescent question-asking and provider education during paediatric diabetes visits. Adolescents aged 11 to 17 with type 1 diabetes and their parents were enrolled from two urban tertiary paediatric clinics. Adolescents were randomised to the intervention group or control group. Adolescent consultations were audio-recorded, their HbA1c level was recorded, and they completed surveys after three clinic appointments. The intervention group completed a question prompt list and watched a video on a tablet with their parents before meeting their doctor and completed a short evaluation after each visit. Six consultant endocrinologists and ninety-nine adolescents and their parents participated. The intervention increased adolescents' question asking and provider education in diabetes encounters. Total patient question-asking across the 3 consultations and a higher baseline HbA1c at time one was significantly associated with HbA1c at time three. Question prompt lists and an educational video are useful tools to increase adolescents' question-asking and communication between adolescents and their providers. Interventions that encourage adolescents' question-asking in healthcare encounters may lead to more meaningful providers-adolescents' communication and tailored education.

Shaping DNA damage responses: Therapeutic potential of targeting telomeric proteins and DNA repair factors in cancer.,"Shelterin proteins regulate genomic stability by preventing inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) at telomeres. Unprotected telomeres lead to persistent DDR causing cell cycle inhibition, growth arrest, and apoptosis. Cancer cells rely on DDR to protect themselves from DNA lesions and exogenous DNA-damaging agents such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, targeting DDR machinery is a promising strategy to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to existing cancer therapies. However, the success of these DDR inhibitors depends on other mutations, and over time, patients develop resistance to these therapies. This suggests the need for alternative approaches. One promising strategy is co-inhibiting shelterin proteins with DDR molecules, which would offset cellular fitness in DNA repair in a mutation-independent manner. This review highlights the associations and dependencies of the shelterin complex with the DDR proteins and discusses potential co-inhibition strategies that might improve the therapeutic potential of current inhibitors.",['Ng YB; Akincilar SC'],2024,"shelterin proteins regulate genomic stability by preventing inappropriate DNA damage responses (DDRs) at telomeres. unprotected telomeres lead to persistent DDR causing cell cycle inhibition, growth arrest, and apoptosis."
SPONTANEOUS REGRESSION OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA: FOCUSING IN THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS.,"Spontaneous regression (SR) is defined as the partial or complete disappearance of a tumor, in the absence of a specific treatment. Evidence of the SR in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare. The authors aimed to review all the cases of SR of HCC in two reference centers of Southern Brazil, highlighting the main characteristics. Data of all patients with HCC were retrospectively reviewed looking for the occurrence of SR in patients from two tertiary centers in Southern Brazil, in the last five years. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was established according to clinical, laboratory and imaging data, as well as upper endoscopy or histopathological examination when necessary. The diagnosis of HCC was based on typical findings according to radiologic criteria (LIRADS) or histopathological examination. Spontaneous regression was defined as a partial or complete involution of a HCC in the absence of a specific therapy. From all cases of HCC in the last 5 years (n=433), there were five cases of SR. Three (60%) were men, the mean age was 62.6 (50.0-76.0) years, and the etiology was HCV in 3 (60%). Complete regression was observed in three patients (60%), one patient (20%) presented partial regression, and one (20%) relapesed and died. The time of follow-up varied between 12 and 21 months. In this presentation, it was highlighted one case of SR observed after COVID-19 infection in a patient with cirrhosis. The possible mechanisms involved in this situation were reviewed, emphasizing the most common like hypoxia and immunological. There were also one patient submitted to a surgical procedure as a possible fator involved and three patients without obvious risk factors. This phenomenon will possibly contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of HCC.",['Tovo CV; Ribas CR; Sartori GDP; Coral GP; Suwa E; Mattos AA'],2024,SR is defined as partial or complete disappearance of a tumor. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rare.
"Secondhand smoke exposure in public outdoor spaces in the Netherlands: The stronger the smell, the more exposure to nicotine.","While secondhand smoke exposure in outdoor spaces has been investigated before, no data on outdoor secondhand smoke exposure have been collected in the Netherlands. Such data could help policymakers gain support for smoke-free outdoor public spaces. Between May and November 2021, we visited 25 outdoor locations across the Netherlands. At each location, we conducted four measurements with smokers and one measurement without smokers. During each measurement, we counted the number of smokers present and we rated tobacco smell intensity on a five-point scale. Airborne nicotine and 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP) data were collected through active sampling on thermal desorption tubes. The contents of these tubes were later analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using linear mixed models, we investigated the association between levels of nicotine and the presence of smokers, the number of smokers, and the intensity of tobacco smell. We also investigated these association with levels of 3-EP. Nicotine levels were higher when smokers were present (B=1.40; 95% CI: 0.69-2.11, p<0.001). For each additional smoker present, we measured higher levels of nicotine (B=0.23; 95% CI: 0.10-0.37, p=0.001). When the smell of tobacco smoke was noted to be stronger by the researchers, higher levels of nicotine were measured through sampling (B=0.85; 95% CI: 0.44-1.26, p<0.001). We found similar results for 3-EP levels. This study showed that both nicotine and 3-EP are useful in quantifying levels of secondhand smoke in various outdoor locations. The level of nicotine exposure outdoors was positively associated with the number of smokers nearby. The intensity of the tobacco smell was also related to nicotine exposure: the stronger the smell of tobacco smoke, the more nicotine was measured in the air.",['Bommelé J; Cremers H; Den Hollander W; Troelstra S; Geuke G; Dam W; Willemse E; Hopman P; Hipple Walters B; Willemsen M'],2024,"between may and November 2021, we visited 25 outdoor locations across the Netherlands. a measurement with smokers and one without smokers was conducted. nicotine levels were higher when smokers were present."
Type 2 diabetes mellitus/obesity drugs: a neurodegenerative disorders savior or a bridge too far?,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist-based drugs (incretin mimetics) have meaningfully impacted current treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and their actions on satiety and weight loss have led to their use as an obesity medication.

A Prospective Study of Publicly Funded Molecular Testing of Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules: Canada's Experience.,"Indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs) lead to diagnostic surgeries in many countries. Use of molecular testing (MT) is endorsed by several guidelines, but costs are limitative, especially in public healthcare systems like in Canada. Primary objective: evaluate the clinical value of Thyroseq® v3 (TSv3) using benign call rate (BCR) in a real-world practice. Secondary objective: assess cost-effectiveness of MT. This is a multicentric prospective study. This study was conducted in 5 academic centers in Quebec, Canada. 500 consecutive patients with Bethesda III (on 2 consecutive cytopathologies) or IV and TIRADS 3 or 4 nodules measuring 1 to 4 cm were included. MT was performed between November 2021 and November 2022. Patients with a positive TSv3 were referred to surgery. Patients with a negative TSv3 were planned for follow-up by ultrasonography for a minimum of 2 years. The BCR, corresponding to the proportion of ITNs with negative TSv3 results, was assessed. 500 patients underwent TSv3 testing, with a BCR of 72.6% (95% CI: 68.5-76.5; p<0.001). 99.7% of patients with a negative result avoided surgery. The positive predictive value of TSv3 was 68.2% (95% CI: 58.5-76.9). The cost-benefit analysis identified that the implementation of MT would yield cost savings of $6.1 million over the next 10 years. Use of MT (TSv3) in a well-selected population with ITNs led to a BCR of 72.6%.

Nondisclosure of Type 1 Diabetes in Adolescence: A Single-Center Experience.,"The aim of this study was to assess the extent of nondisclosure of type 1 diabetes in adolescents and investigate its association with several psychosocial parameters and clinical outcomes. This was a cross-sectional study based on data collected from 69 adolescents with type 1 diabetes who were 12-18 years of age and followed at our diabetes clinic. The degree of disclosure, demographics, diabetes management, and psychosocial issues were assessed via questionnaires. Clinical parameters were derived from medical records. Associations between nondisclosure status and clinical and psychosocial study variables were assessed. Fifty-three participants (77%) reported some extent of nondisclosure. Nondisclosure was associated with low self-esteem, reduced friend support, and increased diabetes-related worries. Nondisclosure was also found to be associated with diminished self-care behaviors related to insulin administration and with elevated A1C. Our results demonstrate that nondisclosure of type 1 diabetes in adolescents may be more common than initially recognized and is likely associated with unfavorable psychological outcomes and reduced self-care and diabetes management. Our results emphasize the importance of social interactions and disclosure in adolescents and may serve as a potential stepping stone to address other social barriers hindering diabetes management.",['Nir J; Liberman A; Yackobovitch-Gavan M; Fraser D; Phillip M; Oron T'],2024,"study was based on data collected from 69 adolescents with type 1 diabetes. disclosure, demographics, diabetes management, and psychosocial issues were assessed."

Development of a new health-related quality of life measure for people with diabetes who experience hypoglycaemia: the Hypo-RESOLVE QoL.,"Valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures are vital for assessing disease impact, responsiveness to healthcare and the cost-effectiveness of interventions. A recent review has questioned the ability of existing measures to assess hypoglycaemia-related impacts on health-related quality of life for people with diabetes. This mixed-methods project was designed to produce a novel health-related quality of life patient-reported outcome measure in hypoglycaemia: the Hypo-RESOLVE QoL. Three studies were conducted with people with diabetes who experience hypoglycaemia. In Stage 1, a comprehensive health-related quality of life framework for hypoglycaemia was elicited from semi-structured interviews (N=31). In Stage 2, the content validity and acceptability of draft measure content were tested via three waves of cognitive debriefing interviews (N=70 people with diabetes; N=14 clinicians). In Stage 3, revised measure content was administered alongside existing generic and diabetes-related measures in a large cross-sectional observational survey to assess psychometric performance (N=1246). The final measure was developed using multiple evidence sources, incorporating stakeholder engagement. A novel conceptual model of hypoglycaemia-related health-related quality of life was generated, featuring 19 themes, organised by physical, social and psychological aspects. From a draft version of 76 items, a final 14-item measure was produced with satisfactory structural (χ<sup>2</sup>=472.27, df=74, p<0.001; comparative fit index =0.943; root mean square error of approximation =0.069) and convergent validity with related constructs (r=0.46-0.59), internal consistency (α=0.91) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient =0.87). The Hypo-RESOLVE QoL is a rigorously developed patient-reported outcome measure assessing the health-related quality of life impacts of hypoglycaemia. The Hypo-RESOLVE QoL has demonstrable validity and reliability and has value for use in clinical decision-making and as a clinical trial endpoint.

Contributors to post-operative venous thromboembolism risk after breast cancer surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) events are a preventable complication for patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. However, there is a lack of consistency in the existing literature regarding the potential risk factors affecting these individuals. This study aimed to investigate the potential risk factors associated with an increased risk of VTE following surgery for breast cancer. Data on patient characteristics such as age, body mass index (BMI), existing comorbidities, smoking history, surgical interventions, duration of hospitalization, and post-operative complications were recorded and analyzed. Thirty-one studies investigating the incidence of VTE following surgical interventions for breast cancer were included. This study included 22,155 female patients with a mean age of 50.8 ± 2.9 years. The weighted mean length of surgery and hospital stay were 382.1 ± 170.0 min and 4.5 ± 2.7 days, respectively. The patients were followed-up for a weighted mean duration of 13.8 ± 21.2 months. The total incidence of VTE events was 2.2% (n = 489). Meta-analysis showed that patients with post-operative VTE had a significantly higher mean age and BMI, as well as longer mean length of surgery (P < 0.05). Comparing the techniques of autologous breast reconstruction showed that the risk of post-operative VTE is significantly higher with deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps, compared with the transverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps (P < 0.05). Compared with delayed reconstruction, immediate reconstruction was associated with a significantly higher incidence of VTE (P < 0.05). Smoking history, length of hospital stay, and Caprini score did not correlate with increased incidence of post-operative VTE. The incidence rate of VTE events in patients receiving surgical treatment for breast cancer is 2.2%. Risk factors for developing post-operative VTE in this patient population were found to be older age, increased BMI, extended length of surgical procedures, and DIEP flap reconstruction.",['Ahmed SH; Shekouhi R; Gerhold C; Mattia A; Azizi A; Donath G; Chim H'],2024,"study aimed to investigate potential risk factors associated with increased risk of VTE following surgery for breast cancer. data on patient characteristics such as age, body mass index, existing comorbidities, smoking history, surgical interventions, duration of hospitalization, and post-operative complications were recorded and analyzed."
Production of deoxycholic acid by low-abundant microbial species is associated with impaired glucose metabolism.,"Alterations in gut microbiota composition are suggested to contribute to cardiometabolic diseases, in part by producing bioactive molecules. Some of the metabolites are produced by very low abundant bacterial taxa, which largely have been neglected due to limits of detection. However, the concentration of microbially produced metabolites from these taxa can still reach high levels and have substantial impact on host physiology. To explore this concept, we focused on the generation of secondary bile acids by 7α-dehydroxylating bacteria and demonstrated that addition of a very low abundant bacteria to a community can change the metabolic output dramatically. We show that Clostridium scindens converts cholic acid into the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA) very efficiently even though the abundance of C. scindens is low, but still detectable by digital droplet PCR. We also show that colonization of germ-free female mice with a community containing C. scindens induces DCA production and affects host metabolism. Finally, we show that DCA correlates with impaired glucose metabolism and a worsened lipid profile in individuals with type 2 diabetes, which implies that this metabolic pathway may contribute to the development of cardiometabolic disease.",['Wahlström A; Brumbaugh A; Sjöland W; Olsson L; Wu H; Henricsson M; Lundqvist A; Makki K; Hazen SL; Bergström G; Marschall HU; Fischbach MA; Bäckhed F'],2024,metabolites from these taxa are produced by very low abundant bacterial taxa. the concentration of microbially produced metabolites from these taxa can still reach high levels. this could have substantial impact on host physiology.
Late coronary artery injury following chemoradiotherapy for thymic carcinoma: a case report.,"Surgery remains the primary treatment modality for thymic carcinoma, with adjuvant radiotherapy being recommended to effectively mitigate local recurrence and metastasis rates subsequent to incomplete or complete resection. Chemoradiotherapy has the potential to induce coronary artery occlusion, thereby potentially impacting patients' long-term survival rates. The existing literature currently lacks comprehensive research on the lesion characteristics of coronary artery injury resulting from chemoradiotherapy. The male patient, aged 55, was admitted to the hospital due to recurrent chest tightness and pain persisting for one week. Notably, the patient had previously undergone curative resection surgery for thymic carcinoma seven years ago. After the surgical procedure, the patient underwent a course of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising docetaxel and platinum. 11 months later, imaging examination diagnosed tumor recurrence, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy was administered at a total dose of 62 Gy/31F for planning gross target volume (PGTV) and 54 Gy/31F for planning target volume (PTV) with 2 cycles of paclitaxel and cisplatin. Re-admission of the patient occurred after a 7-year interval subsequent to the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, leading to a subsequent diagnosis of acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Following administration of antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and anti-myocardial ischemia therapy, coronary angiography revealed the presence of a bifurcation lesion at the distal end of the left main trunk. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examination demonstrated significant negative remodeling of both the main trunk and its branches at the bifurcation site, characterized by minimal atherosclerotic plaque components.

Performance of an ultra-fast deep-learning accelerated MRI screening protocol for prostate cancer compared to a standard multiparametric protocol.,"To establish and evaluate an ultra-fast MRI screening protocol for prostate cancer (PCa) in comparison to the standard multiparametric (mp) protocol, reducing scan time and maintaining adequate diagnostic performance. This prospective single-center study included consecutive biopsy-naïve patients with suspected PCa between December 2022 and March 2023. A PI-RADSv2.1 conform mpMRI protocol was acquired in a 3 T scanner (scan time: 25 min 45 sec). In addition, two deep-learning (DL) accelerated sequences (T2- and diffusion-weighted) were acquired, serving as a screening protocol (scan time: 3 min 28 sec). Two readers evaluated image quality and the probability of PCa regarding PI-RADSv2.1 scores in two sessions. The diagnostic performance of the screening protocol with mpMRI serving as the reference standard was derived. Inter- and intra-reader agreements were evaluated using weighted kappa statistics. We included 77 patients with 97 lesions (mean age: 66 years; SD: 7.7). Diagnostic performance of the screening protocol was excellent with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%/100% and 89%/98% (cut-off ≥ PI-RADS 4) for reader 1 (R1) and reader 2 (R2), respectively. Mean image quality was 3.96 (R1) and 4.35 (R2) for the standard protocol vs. 4.74 and 4.57 for the screening protocol (p < 0.05). Inter-reader agreement was moderate (κ: 0.55) for the screening protocol and substantial (κ: 0.61) for the multiparametric protocol. The ultra-fast screening protocol showed similar diagnostic performance and better imaging quality compared to the mpMRI in under 15% of scan time, improving efficacy and enabling the implementation of screening protocols in clinical routine. The ultra-fast protocol enables examinations without contrast administration, drastically reducing scan time to 3.5 min with similar diagnostic performance and better imaging quality. This facilitates patient-friendly, efficient examinations and addresses the conflict of increasing demand for examinations at currently exhausted capacities. Time-consuming MRI protocols are in conflict with an expected increase in examinations required for prostate cancer screening. An ultra-fast MRI protocol shows similar performance and better image quality compared to the standard protocol. Deep-learning acceleration facilitates efficient and patient-friendly examinations, thus improving prostate cancer screening capacity.",['Oerther B; Engel H; Nedelcu A; Strecker R; Benkert T; Nickel D; Weiland E; Mayrhofer T; Bamberg F; Benndorf M; Weiß J; Wilpert C'],2024,prospective single-center study included consecutive biopsy-nave patients with suspected PCa between December 2022 and march 2023. a PI-RADSv2.1 conform mpMRI protocol was acquired in a 3 T scanner (scan time: 25 min 45 sec) two deep-learning (DL) accelerated sequences (T2- and diffusion-weighted) were acquired.
Artificial Intelligence for Breast Cancer Risk Assessment.,"Breast cancer risk prediction models based on common clinical risk factors are used to identify women eligible for high-risk screening and prevention. Unfortunately, these models have only modest discriminatory accuracy with disparities in performance in underrepresented race and ethnicity groups.

Sleep duration and its association with constipation in patients with diabetes: The fukuoka diabetes registry.,"Shorter and longer sleep durations are associated with adverse health consequences. However, available evidence on the association of sleep duration with constipation is limited, especially in patients with diabetes, who are at a high risk of both conditions. This study aimed to examine the association between sleep duration and constipation in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 4,826 patients with type 2 diabetes were classified into six groups according to sleep duration: <4.5, 4.5-5.4, 5.5-6.4, 6.5-7.4, 7.5-8.4, and ≥8.5 hours/day. The odds ratios for the presence of constipation, defined as a defecation frequency <3 times/week and/or laxative use, were calculated using a logistic regression model. Shorter and longer sleep durations were associated with a higher likelihood of constipation than an intermediate duration (6.5-7.4 hours/day). This U-shaped association persisted after adjusting for confounding factors, including lifestyle behavior, measures of obesity and glycemic control, and comorbidities. Broadly identical findings were observed when decreased defecation frequency and laxative use were individually assessed. This study shows a U-shaped association between sleep duration and constipation in patients with type 2 diabetes, and highlights the importance of assessing sleep duration in daily clinical practice.",['Ohkuma T; Iwase M; Kitazono T'],2024,"study aims to examine association between sleep duration and constipation. a total of 4,826 patients with type 2 diabetes were classified into six groups."
Tripartite Motif-containing Protein 11 Silencing Inhibits Proliferation and Glycolysis and Promotes Apoptosis of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cells by Inactivating Signal Transduction and Activation of Transcription Factor 3/c-Myc Signaling.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common type of human digestive tract cancer with poor survival. Tripartite motif-containing protein 11 (TRIM11) is an oncogene in certain cancers that can regulate glycolysis and signal transduction and activation of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) signaling. This study was designed to investigate the role and the mechanism of TRIM11 in ESCC. First, TRIM11 expression in ESCC tissues and the correlation between TRIM11 expression and prognosis were analyzed using bioinformatics tools. After TRIM11 expression was detected by Western blot in ESCC cells, TRIM11 was silenced to evaluate its effect on the malignant phenotypes of ESCC cells. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay, ethynyl-2'- deoxyuridine staining, and flow cytometry, respectively. The glucose uptake and lactate secretion were detected to examine glycolysis. In addition, Western blot was employed to detect the expression of proteins related to apoptosis, glycolysis, and STAT3/c-Myc signaling. Then, ESCC cells were treated with STAT3 activator further to clarify the regulatory effect of TRIM11 on STAT3/c-Myc signaling. TRIM11 was upregulated in ESCC tissues and cells, and high expression of TRIM11 was associated with a poor prognosis. TRIM11 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and glycolysis while facilitating apoptosis of ESCC cells. Besides, the expression of p-STAT3 and c-Myc was significantly downregulated by TRIM11 silencing. Of note, the STAT3 activator partially reversed the effects of TRIM11 depletion on the proliferation, apoptosis, and glycolysis in ESCC cells. Collectively, TRIM11 loss-of-function affects the proliferation, apoptosis, and glycolysis in ESCC cells by inactivating STAT3/c-Myc signaling.",['Xuan T'],2024,TRIM11 is an oncogene in certain cancers that regulate glycolysis.

Immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema due to diabetes and retinal vein occlusion.,"To objectively assess the immediate response to intravitreal treatment for macular edema and compare it across different agents. This retrospective, comparative study included patients with macular edema due to diabetic retinopathy (DME) or vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal injections of either steroids (triamcinolone acetonide or dexamethasone sustained release implant) or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (VEGF). The central retinal thickness (CRT) and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were measured 1 day after the injection and compared with immediate pre-injection values. There were 79 eyes (57 patients) including 51 eyes with DME, 18 with branch retinal vein occlusion edema (BRVO-ME), and 10 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion edema (CRVO-ME). The intravitreal agents were triamcinolone acetonide (TA)(<i>n</i> = 15), dexamethasone sustained release implant (DEX)(<i>n</i> = 22), ranibizumab (<i>n</i> = 19), and bevacizumab (<i>n</i> = 23). Statistically significant improvement in CRT was seen in all injection groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while improvement in mean BCVA was significant only in the TA group (<i>p</i> = 0.009). The mean change in CRT was maximum with steroids than with anti-VEGFs; viz. 159.47 µ in TA, 115.45 µ in DEX, 86.10 µ in ranibizumab, and 78.78 µ in bevacizumab group. Least amount of change was noted in the spongy type of macular edema (18.73 µ) while improvement in mean BCVA was statistically significant only in the cystoid group (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Comparatively, steroid agents showed better immediate response to therapy than anti-VEGFs. Maximum reduction in central retinal thickness was seen following triamcinolone acetonide injection.

"Current status, challenges and prospects of antifouling materials for oncology applications.","Targeted therapy has become crucial to modern translational science, offering a remedy to conventional drug delivery challenges. Conventional drug delivery systems encountered challenges related to solubility, prolonged release, and inadequate drug penetration at the target region, such as a tumor. Several formulations, such as liposomes, polymers, and dendrimers, have been successful in advancing to clinical trials with the goal of improving the drug's pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Various stealth coatings, including hydrophilic polymers such as PEG, chitosan, and polyacrylamides, can form a protective layer over nanoparticles, preventing aggregation, opsonization, and immune system detection. As a result, they are classified under the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) category. Serum, a biological sample, has a complex composition. Non-specific adsorption of chemicals onto an electrode can lead to fouling, impacting the sensitivity and accuracy of focused diagnostics and therapies. Various anti-fouling materials and procedures have been developed to minimize the impact of fouling on specific diagnoses and therapies, leading to significant advancements in recent decades. This study provides a detailed analysis of current methodologies using surface modifications that leverage the antifouling properties of polymers, peptides, proteins, and cell membranes for advanced targeted diagnostics and therapy in cancer treatment.

Measuring the effectiveness of hybrid diabetes care over 90 days through continuous data monitoring in type 2 diabetic patients.,"Diabetes Mellitus, a global health challenge, affects 537 million individuals. Traditional management relies on periodic clinic visits, but technological advancements, including remote monitoring, offer transformative changes. Telemedicine enhances access, convenience, adherence, and glycemic control. Challenges include trust-building and limitations in face-to-face interactions. Integrating remote monitoring with in-person healthcare creates a hybrid approach. This study evaluates the impact on Type 2 Diabetes patients over 3 months. A retrospective case-control observational study. Inclusion criteria involved previous Type 2 Diabetes diagnosis and a minimum 3-month GluCare model period with two physical visits. Patients in the case group had in-clinic visits, bi-weekly app engagement, and monthly body weight readings. Control group had in-clinic visits only. Outcomes measured included HbA1c, lipid profile, CV risk, eGFR, urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratio, Uric Acid, and CRP. Case group showed significant HbA1c improvements (-2.19%), especially in higher baseline levels. Weight, BMI, LDL, total cholesterol, and CVD risk also improved. Controls showed smaller improvements. Higher digital interactions correlated with better outcomes. Patients with ≥11 interactions showed significant reductions in HbA1c (-2.38%) and weight (-6.00 kg). The GluCare.Health hybrid model demonstrates promising outcomes in Type 2 diabetes management. The integration of in-clinic consultations with continuous remote monitoring leads to substantial improvements in glycemic control and clinical parameters. The study highlights the importance of patient engagement in achieving positive outcomes, with higher digital interactions associated with greater reductions in HbA1c and weight. The hybrid approach proves more effective than digital-only interventions, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, end-to-end solutions in diabetes care.",['Zakaria H; Said Y; Aleabova S; Bangayan J; Dandan M; Debs J; Dahlstrom N; Divino D; Hashemi A; Almarzooqi I'],2024,"a retrospective case-control observational study. patients in the case group had in-clinic visits only. results measured included HbA1c, lipid profile, CV risk, eGFR, urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratio, Uric Acid, and CRP."
Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promotes immune evasion in tumors by facilitating the expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1.,"Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in tumors have been found to correlate with poor clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. Although abundant data support the involvement of PAI-1 in cancer progression, whether PAI-1 contributes to tumor immune surveillance remains unclear. The purposes of this study are to determine whether PAI-1 regulates the expression of immune checkpoint molecules to suppresses the immune response to cancer and demonstrate the potential of PAI-1 inhibition for cancer therapy. The effects of PAI-1 on the expression of the immune checkpoint molecule programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) were investigated in several human and murine tumor cell lines. In addition, we generated tumor-bearing mice and evaluated the effects of a PAI-1 inhibitor on tumor progression or on the tumor infiltration of cells involved in tumor immunity either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. PAI-1 induces PD-L1 expression through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in several types of tumor cells and surrounding cells. Blockade of PAI-1 impedes PD-L1 induction in tumor cells, significantly reducing the abundance of immunosuppressive cells at the tumor site and increasing cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, ultimately leading to tumor regression. The anti-tumor effect elicited by the PAI-1 inhibitor is abolished in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that PAI-1 blockade induces tumor regression by stimulating the immune system. Moreover, combining a PAI-1 inhibitor with an immune checkpoint inhibitor significantly increases tumor regression. PAI-1 protects tumors from immune surveillance by increasing PD-L1 expression; hence, therapeutic PAI-1 blockade may prove valuable in treating malignant tumors.",['Ibrahim AA; Fujimura T; Uno T; Terada T; Hirano KI; Hosokawa H; Ohta A; Miyata T; Ando K; Yahata T'],2024,increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in tumors have been found to correlate with poor clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. the effects of PAI-1 on the expression of immune checkpoint molecules were investigated in several human and murine tumor cell lines.
Bidirectional epigenetic editing reveals hierarchies in gene regulation.,"CRISPR perturbation methods are limited in their ability to study non-coding elements and genetic interactions. In this study, we developed a system for bidirectional epigenetic editing, called CRISPRai, in which we apply activating (CRISPRa) and repressive (CRISPRi) perturbations to two loci simultaneously in the same cell. We developed CRISPRai Perturb-seq by coupling dual perturbation gRNA detection with single-cell RNA sequencing, enabling study of pooled perturbations in a mixed single-cell population. We applied this platform to study the genetic interaction between two hematopoietic lineage transcription factors, SPI1 and GATA1, and discovered novel characteristics of their co-regulation on downstream target genes, including differences in SPI1 and GATA1 occupancy at genes that are regulated through different modes. We also studied the regulatory landscape of IL2 (interleukin-2) in Jurkat T cells, primary T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and elucidated mechanisms of enhancer-mediated IL2 gene regulation. CRISPRai facilitates investigation of context-specific genetic interactions, provides new insights into gene regulation and will enable exploration of non-coding disease-associated variants.",['Pacalin NM; Steinhart Z; Shi Q; Belk JA; Dorovskyi D; Kraft K; Parker KR; Shy BR; Marson A; Chang HY'],2024,we developed a system for bidirectional epigenetic editing called CRISPRai. we apply activating (CRISPRa) and repressive (CRISPRi) perturbations to two loci simultaneously in the same cell. we found novel characteristics of their co-regulation on downstream target genes.

Glycolysis inhibition affects proliferation and cytotoxicity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells expanded for adoptive cell therapy.,"Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are under investigation as alternative effector cells for adoptive cell therapy (ACT) in cancer. Despite promising in vitro results, anti-tumor efficacies in early clinical studies have been lower than expected, which could be ascribed to the complex interplay of tumor and immune cell metabolism competing for the same nutrients in the tumor microenvironment. To contribute to the scarce knowledge regarding gamma delta T-cell metabolism, we investigated the metabolic phenotype of 25-day-expanded Vγ9Vδ2 T cells and how it is intertwined with functionality. We found that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells displayed a quiescent metabolism, utilizing both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for energy production, as measured in Seahorse assays. Upon T-cell receptor activation, both pathways were upregulated, and inhibition with metabolic inhibitors showed that Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were dependent on glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway for proliferation. The dependency on glucose for proliferation was confirmed in glucose-free conditions. Cytotoxicity against malignant melanoma was reduced by glycolysis inhibition but not OXPHOS inhibition. These findings lay the groundwork for further studies on manipulation of Vγ9Vδ2 T-cell metabolism for improved ACT outcome.",['Aehnlich P; Santiago MV; Dam SH; Saló SF; Rahbech A; Olsen LR; Thor Straten P; Desler C; Holmen Olofsson G'],2024,anti-tumor efficacies in early clinical studies have been lower than expected. the findings lay the groundwork for further studies on manipulation of V9V2 T-cell metabolism for improved ACT outcome.
Weight loss outcomes with semaglutide based on diabetes severity using the individualized metabolic surgery score.,"Semaglutide demonstrated inferior weight loss responses in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to patients with obesity without T2D. The individualized metabolic surgery (IMS) score was validated to predict T2D remission after bariatric surgery. The parameters of the IMS are HbA1c (<7%), insulin use, T2D medications and T2D duration. We aim to assess weight loss outcomes of semaglutide based on IMS score in patients with obesity and T2D. This is a retrospective multicentered cohort study of patients with T2D and BMI≥ 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> taking ≥1 mg of semaglutide recruited from January 2020 to December 2022. We excluded patients with a history of bariatric surgery or taking other anti-obesity medications. IMS was calculated at baseline and patients weight change was recorded at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. IMS was classified as mild (0-24.9 points), moderate (25-94.9 points), and severe (95-180 points). Analysis was performed based on IMS score quartiles and combination of Mild-Moderate vs Severe categories. We performed mixed linear regression models including age, sex, and baseline weight to assess associations between IMS categories with total body weight loss percentage (TBWL%). We included 297 patients (42% female, mean age 62 ± 12 years) in the analysis. At 12 months, there was a stepwise decrease in weight loss outcomes when comparing patients by IMS quartiles (LS mean TBWL%± SE): 8.8 ± 0.8% vs 6.9 ± 0.8% vs 5.7 ± 0.9% vs 5.0 ± 0.8%. In the mixed linear model, patients in the mild-moderate category achieved significantly superior weight loss outcomes (LS mean TBWL± SE: -8.3 ± 0.7%) than patients in the severe category (-5.5 ± 0.6%; difference: -2.9, 95% CI: -5.2 to -0.5, p = 0.006) at 12 months. There was no significant difference in glycemic improvement regardless of IMS severity at baseline. In our cohort, lower IMS severity was associated with more weight loss in patients with obesity and T2D. Further studies are needed to understand T2D severity and its effect on semaglutide outcomes.

Acinic cell Carcinoma with high-grade Squamoglandular and Chondrosarcomatous Transformation Mimicking 'Carcinosarcoma ex-pleomorphic Adenoma': A Wrinkle in the Proposed Nomenclature Revision for Sarcomatoid Salivary Gland Neoplasms.,"While acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) can undergo high-grade transformation (HGT) to high-grade adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma, other morphologies such as spindle cell/sarcomatoid carcinoma are rare and not well-characterized. We herein report a novel case of AciCC with squamoglandular and chondrosarcomatous HGT mimicking a so-called 'carcinosarcoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma'. The patient is an 81-year-old male with a two-month history of neck swelling and referred otalgia who presented with a left parapharyngeal space mass extending into retropharyngeal space and pterygoid muscles. On resection, the tumor showed considerable morphologic diversity with high-grade serous and mucous acinar components as well as cribriform to solid apocrine-like components with comedonecrosis and squamous differentiation, all of which were embedded in a chondromyxoid background ranging from paucicellular and bland to a high-grade chondrosarcoma/pleomorphic sarcoma-like appearance. Only a minor conventional AciCC component was noted. Immunostains were negative for AR and only focally positive for GCDFP-15 arguing against a true apocrine phenotype, while PLAG1 and HMGA2 were negative arguing against an antecedent pleomorphic adenoma. On the other hand, SOX-10, DOG-1 and PAS after diastase highlighted serous acinar differentiation, and mucicarmine, and NKX3.1 highlighted mucous acinar differentiation. NR4A3 immunohistochemical staining and NR4A3 fluorescence in situ hybridization were positive in the carcinomatous and sarcomatoid components while sequencing analysis of both components revealed identical alterations involving TP53, PIK3CB, ARID1A, and STK11. This unique case warrants caution in designating all salivary sarcomatoid carcinomas with heterologous elements as part of the 'carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma' family.",['Rammal R; Batson B; Spector ME; Chiosea SI; Seethala RR'],2024,acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) can undergo high-grade transformation (HGT) to high-grade adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma. other morphologies such as spindle cell/sarcomatoid carcinoma are rare and not well-characterized.
Impact of tibial transverse transport in tissue regeneration and wound healing with perspective on diabetic foot ulcers.,"In this editorial, we comment on an article by Liao <i>et al</i> published in the current issue of the <i>World Journal of Diabetes</i>. We focus on the clinical significance of tibial transverse transport (TTT) as an effective treatment for patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). TTT has been associated with tissue regeneration, improved blood circulation, reduced amputation rates, and increased expression of early angiogenic factors. Mechanistically, TTT can influence macrophage polarization and growth factor upregulation. Despite this potential, the limitations and conflicting results of existing studies justify the need for further research into its optimal application and development. These clinical implications highlight the efficacy of TTT in recalcitrant DFU and provide lasting stimuli for tissue re-generation, and blood vessel and bone marrow improvement. Immunomodulation <i>via</i> systemic responses contributes to its therapeutic potential. Future studies should investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms to enhance our understanding and the efficacy of TTT. This manuscript emphasizes the potential of TTT in limb preservation and diabetic wound healing and suggests avenues for preventive measures against limb amputation in diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Here, we highlight the clinical significance of the TTT and its importance in healing DFU to promote the use of this technique in tissue regeneration.",['Mukherjee S; Im SS'],2024,"tibial transverse transport (TTT) is an effective treatment for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. it has been associated with tissue regeneration, improved blood circulation, reduced amputation rates, and increased expression of early angiogenic factors."
The Role of Digital Health Technology Interventions in the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes in the 21st century presents one of the greatest burdens of disease on the global population. Digitally mediated interventions have become imperative in alleviating this disease epidemic. We aimed to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on different health technologies for preventing Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and their efficacy in decreasing diabetes risk-related outcomes in at-risk patients in comparison to standard care. Five electronic databases were searched between October 2021 and December 2022. Studies including digital health technology interventions used for preventing diabetes development by reducing diabetes risk-related outcomes in at-risk adults (⩾18 years) were identified. Data on glycemic levels, incidence of T2DM, weight, and intervention descriptions were extracted, and the risk of bias (ROB) was assessed. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria and 5 studies (56%) achieved clinically significant outcomes in at least one of the following: decreased weight (22%), glycemic levels (22%), or incidence of T2DM (11%). Two of the 3 (67%) computer-based interventions effectively reduced the HbA1c levels and mean weight of their study population, and 3 of 6 (50%) mobile based interventions (text messages, mobile app, and telehealth) decreased the incidence of T2DM and HbA1c levels. Four studies each had an overall low ROB and one had a high ROB due to attrition. Preliminary evidence identified in our review demonstrated that health technologies for diabetes prevention are effective for improving diabetes risk-related outcomes. Future research into digital technology protocol and studies of longer duration and more diverse populations are needed for clinical feasibility.",['Nguyen V; Ara P; Simmons D; Osuagwu UL'],2024,digitally mediated interventions have become imperative in alleviating diabetes epidemic. randomized controlled trials on different health technologies for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus were searched between October 2021 and December 2022.
Principle of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography.,"Sonazoid, an ultrasound contrast agent, has been covered by insurance in Japan since January 2007 for the diagnosis of hepatic mass lesions and is widely used for diagnosing not only primary liver cancer but also liver metastases such as those from breast cancer and colorectal cancer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for breast mass lesions has been covered by insurance since August 2012 after phase II and phase III clinical trials showed that the diagnostic performance was significantly superior to that of B-mode and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. This paper describes the principles of imaging techniques in contrast-enhanced ultrasonography including the filter, pulse inversion, amplitude modulation, and amplitude-modulated pulse inversion methods. The pulse inversion method, which visualizes the second-harmonic component using the nonlinear scattering characteristics of the contrast agent, is widely used regardless of the contrast agent and target organ because of its high resolution. Sonazoid has a stiffer shell and requires a higher acoustic amplitude than Sonovue to generate nonlinear vibrations. The higher transmitted sound pressure generates more tissue harmonic components. Since pulse inversion allows visualization of the tissue harmonic components, amplitude modulation and amplitude-modulated pulse inversion, which include few tissue harmonic components, are primarily used. Amplitude modulation methods detect nonlinear signals from the contrast agent in the fundamental band. The mechanism of the amplitude modulation is considered to be changes in the echo signal's phase depending on the sound pressure. Since the tissue-derived component is minor in amplitude modulation methods, good contrast sensitivity can be obtained.",['Mine Y; Takada E; Sugimoto K; Moriyasu F'],2024,contrast agent Sonazoid has been covered by insurance in japan since 2007. the diagnosis of hepatic mass lesions is superior to that of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. the contrast agent is widely used regardless of the contrast agent and target organ because of its high resolution.
Sex-specific association of serum dehydroepiandrosterone and its sulfate levels with osteoporosis in type 2 diabetes.,"This study is to investigate the relation between serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEAS) levels and the risk of osteoporosis in patients with T2DM. This cross-sectional study involved 938 hospitalized patients with T2DM. Linear regression models were used to explore the relationship between DHEA and DHEAS and the BMD at different skeletal sites. Multinominal logistic regression models and the restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to evaluate the associations of DHEA and DHEAS with the risks of osteopenia and/or osteoporosis. In postmenopausal women with T2DM, after adjustment for confounders including testosterone and estradiol, DHEA showed a significant positive correlation with lumbar spine BMD (P = 0.013). Moreover, DHEAS exhibited significant positive correlations with BMD at three skeletal sites: including femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine (all P < 0.05). Low DHEA and DHEAS levels were associated with increased risk of osteopenia and/or osteoporosis (all P < 0.05) and the risk of osteoporosis gradually decreased with increasing DHEAS levels (P overall = 0.018, P-nonlinear = 0.559). However, DHEA and DHEAS levels in men over the age of 50 with T2DM were not associated with any of above outcomes.

Clinical Trial Protocol for Porcine Islet Xenotransplantation in South Korea.,"Islet transplantation holds promise for treating selected type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, yet the scarcity of human donor organs impedes widespread adoption. Porcine islets, deemed a viable alternative, recently demonstrated successful longterm survival without zoonotic risks in a clinically relevant pig-to-non-human primate islet transplantation model. This success prompted the development of a clinical trial protocol for porcine islet xenotransplantation in humans. A single-center, open-label clinical trial initiated by the sponsor will assess the safety and efficacy of porcine islet transplantation for diabetes patients at Gachon Hospital. The protocol received approval from the Gachon Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) under the Investigational New Drug (IND) process. Two diabetic patients, experiencing inadequate glycemic control despite intensive insulin treatment and frequent hypoglycemic unawareness, will be enrolled. Participants and their family members will engage in deliberation before xenotransplantation during the screening period. Each patient will receive islets isolated from designated pathogen-free pigs. Immunosuppressants and systemic infection prophylaxis will follow the program schedule. The primary endpoint is to confirm the safety of porcine islets in patients, and the secondary endpoint is to assess whether porcine islets can reduce insulin dose and the frequency of hypoglycemic unawareness. A clinical trial protocol adhering to global consensus guidelines for porcine islet xenotransplantation is presented, facilitating streamlined implementation of comparable human trials worldwide.",['Kim BJ; Shin JS; Min BH; Kim JM; Park CG; Kang HJ; Hwang ES; Lee WW; Kim JS; Kim HJ; Kwon I; Kim JS; Kim GS; Moon J; Shin DY; Cho B; Yang HM; Kim SJ; Kim KW'],2024,a clinical trial protocol for porcine islet xenotransplantation is being developed. the protocol was approved by the irb and the MFDS. the protocol is a clinical trial protocol for porcine islet xenotransplantation.
Identification of high-performing antibodies for the reliable detection of Tau proteoforms by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.,"Antibodies are essential research tools whose performance directly impacts research conclusions and reproducibility. Owing to its central role in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, hundreds of distinct antibody clones have been developed against the microtubule-associated protein Tau and its multiple proteoforms. Despite this breadth of offer, limited understanding of their performance and poor antibody selectivity have hindered research progress. Here, we validate a large panel of Tau antibodies by Western blot (79 reagents) and immunohistochemistry (35 reagents). We address the reagents' ability to detect the target proteoform, selectivity, the impact of protein phosphorylation on antibody binding and performance in human brain samples. While most antibodies detected Tau at high levels, many failed to detect it at lower, endogenous levels. By WB, non-selective binding to other proteins affected over half of the antibodies tested, with several cross-reacting with the related MAP2 protein, whereas the ""oligomeric Tau"" T22 antibody reacted with monomeric Tau by WB, thus calling into question its specificity to Tau oligomers. Despite the presumption that ""total"" Tau antibodies are agnostic to post-translational modifications, we found that phosphorylation partially inhibits binding for many such antibodies, including the popular Tau-5 clone. We further combine high-sensitivity reagents, mass-spectrometry proteomics and cDNA sequencing to demonstrate that presumptive Tau ""knockout"" human cells continue to express residual protein arising through exon skipping, providing evidence of previously unappreciated gene plasticity. Finally, probing of human brain samples with a large panel of antibodies revealed the presence of C-term-truncated versions of all main Tau brain isoforms in both control and tauopathy donors. Ultimately, we identify a validated panel of Tau antibodies that can be employed in Western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry to reliably detect even low levels of Tau expression with high selectivity. This work represents an extensive resource that will enable the re-interpretation of published data, improve reproducibility in Tau research, and overall accelerate scientific progress.","[""Ellis MJ; Lekka C; Holden KL; Tulmin H; Seedat F; O'Brien DP; Dhayal S; Zeissler ML; Knudsen JG; Kessler BM; Morgan NG; Todd JA; Richardson SJ; Stefana MI""]",2024,"a large panel of Tau antibodies by Western blot (79 reagents) and immunohistochemistry (35 reagents) have been developed against the microtubule-associated protein Tau. despite this breadth of offer, limited understanding of their performance and poor antibody selectivity have hindered research progress."
Prescribing Trends of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors and Mortality among Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients: Insights from the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Registry.,"Despite guideline recommendations, suboptimal prescription rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been observed in patients with acute coronary syndrome. This study aimed to examine the temporal trends, variations, and mortality outcomes among acute coronary syndrome patients prescribed ACEIs/ARBs in the multi-ethnic population of Malaysia. This retrospective study utilized data from the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease-Acute Coronary Syndrome registry, encompassing consecutive patient records from 2008 to 2017 (<i>N</i> = 60,854). Ten-year temporal trends of on-discharge ACEIs/ARBs prescription were examined. Demographics, clinical characteristics and 1-year all-cause mortality outcomes were compared between patients prescribed and not prescribed ACEIs/ARBs. The 10-year prescription rate of on-discharge ACEIs/ARBs was 52.8% (<i>n</i> = 32,140), with a significant decline over the years [linear trend test, <i>P</i> = 0.008; SD = 0.03; SE = 0.001; 95% CI = 0.55-0.64]. Patients aged ≥65 years (aOR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.73-0.86) were less likely to be prescribed ACEIs/ARBs than those aged <65 years. In addition, patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus (DM) (aOR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.79-0.92) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (aOR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.30-0.40) were significantly less likely to receive ACEIs/ARBs. IPW-adjusted survival analysis revealed a 38% lower 1-year all-cause mortality rate in patients prescribed on-discharge ACEIs/ARBs (HR = 0.62; 95% CI = 0.56-0.69; <i>P</i> < 0.001).

A Comprehensive Review and Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Its Impact on Alzheimer's Disease Risk in Older Men with Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting males worldwide. Despite reductions in mortality rates due to advances in early identification and treatment methods, PCa remains a major health concern. Recent research has shed light on a possible link between PCa and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a significant neurological ailment that affects older males all over the world. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a cornerstone therapeutic method used in conjunction with radiation and palliative care in advanced metastatic PCa cases, is critical for disease management. Evidence reveals a relationship between ADT and cognitive impairment. Hormonal manipulation may cause long-term cognitive problems through processes such as amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Fluctuations in basal androgen levels can upset the delicate balance of genes that are sensitive to androgen levels, contributing to cognitive impairment. This detailed review dives into the various aspects of PCa aetiology and its relationship with cognitive decline. It investigates the discovery of particular biomarkers, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs), which play important roles in pathogenic progression. The review attempts to identify potential biomarkers associated with ADT-induced cerebral changes, including Aβ oligomer buildup, NFT formation, and tauopathy, which can contribute to early-onset dementia and cognitive impairment. Besides it further aims to provide insights into innovative diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for alleviating PCa and ADT-related cognitive sequelae by unravelling these complicated pathways and molecular mechanisms.",['Singh M; Agarwal V; Pancham P; Jindal D; Agarwal S; Rai SN; Singh SK; Gupta V'],2024,research shed light on a possible link between PCa and Alzheimer's disease. androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is critical for disease management. evidence reveals a relationship between ADT and cognitive impairment.
Endoscopic hand suturing using a modified through-the-scope needle holder for mucosal closure after colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection: Prospective multicenter study (with video).,"Endoscopic hand suturing (EHS) is a novel technique for closing a mucosal defect after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). We investigated the technical feasibility of colorectal EHS using a modified flexible through-the-scope needle holder. This was a prospective multicenter study conducted at two referral centers between June 2022 and April 2023. This study included colorectal neoplasms 20-50 mm in size located in the sigmoid colon or rectum. A modified flexible through-the-scope needle holder, with an increased jaw width to facilitate needle grasping, was used for colorectal EHS. The primary end-points were sustained closure rate on second-look endoscopy (SLE) performed on postoperative days 3-4 and suturing time for colorectal EHS. Secondary end-points included complete closure rate and delayed adverse events. We enrolled 20 colorectal neoplasms in 20 patients, including four patients receiving antithrombotic agents. The tumor location was as follows: lower rectum (n = 8), upper rectum (n = 2), rectosigmoid colon (n = 4), and sigmoid colon (n = 6), and the median mucosal defect size was 37 mm (range, 21-65 mm). The complete closure rate was 90% (18/20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 68.3-98.8%]), and the median suturing time was 49 min (range, 23-92 min [95% CI 35-68 min]). Sustained closure rate on SLE was 85% (17/20 [95% CI 62.1-96.8%]). No delayed adverse events were observed. EHS demonstrated a high sustained closure rate. Given the long suturing time and technical difficulty, EHS should be reserved for cases with a high risk of delayed adverse events.",['Uozumi T; Abe S; Mizuguchi Y; Sekiguchi M; Toyoshima N; Takamaru H; Yamada M; Kobayashi N; Sadachi R; Ito S; Takada K; Kishida Y; Imai K; Hotta K; Ono H; Saito Y'],2024,colorectal neoplasms 20-50 mm in size located in the sigmoid colon or rectum. a modified flexible through-the-scope needle holder was used for colorectal EHS. secondary end-points included complete closure rate and delayed adverse events.
Synthesis and biological studies of pyrimidine derivatives targeting metabolic enzymes.,"Novel synthesized pyrimidine derivatives were investigated against carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes I and II (hCA I and II), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), α-glycosidase, and aldose reductase (AR) enzymes associated with some common diseases such as epilepsy, glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and neuropathy. When the results were examined, novel synthesized pyrimidine derivatives were found to have effective inhibition abilities toward the metabolic enzymes. IC<sub>50</sub> values and K<sub>i</sub> values were calculated for each pyrimidine derivative and compared to positive controls. The synthesized novel pyrimidine derivatives exhibited K<sub>i</sub> values in the range of 39.16 ± 7.70-144.62 ± 26.98 nM against hCA I, 18.21 ± 3.66-136.35 ± 21.48 nM toward hCA II, which is associated with different pathological and physiological processes, 33.15 ± 4.85-52.98 ± 19.86 nM on AChE, and 31.96 ± 8.24-69.57 ± 21.27 nM on BChE.

Shedding light on the shadows: oxidative stress and its pivotal role in prostate cancer progression.,"Data on oxidative protein damage, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation in progression of prostate cancer remain elusive. So far, the influence of the presence of perineural invasion on the level of oxidative stress has not been described. Additionally, there is limited data on the level of oxidative stress in patients' urine. We compared the levels of oxidative stress markers in serum and urine in 50 patients with prostate cancer depending on the tumor stage and histological grade, the Gleason score, and the presence of perineural invasion. We found a significantly de-creased level of serum thiol groups and TAC in participants with prostate cancer. Similarly, serum Amadori products and malondialdehyde (MDA) were higher in patients than in healthy men. There was a significantly decrease in TAC and a significantly increased MDA in the urine of prostate cancer patients. As the stage of cancer increased, a decrease in the thiol group concentration and TAC as well as an increase in the concentration of lipid peroxidation products in the serum was observed. The serum level of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) increased in the group with Gleason scores greater than 7. Furthermore, serum thiol groups and TAC were reduced in the group with Gleason >7 as compared to Gleason <7. The presence of perineural invasion significantly reduced serum and urinary TAC and increased urinary AOPP concentration. These results indicate a significant role for oxidative damage in prostate carcinogenesis and its progression. Characterizing oxidative and nitrosative damage to proteins may be useful in designing targeted therapies for prostate cancer patients.",['Biesiadecki M; Mołoń M; Balawender K; Kobylińska Z; Galiniak S'],2024,"oxidative protein damage, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation in prostate cancer progression remains elusive. there is limited data on the level of oxidative stress in patients' urine."

Comparison of clinical and microbiological characteristics of community-acquired hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.,"Invasive infection caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (HvKP) has been reported worldwide. Most of the patients are community population, related to diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic liver disease and other basic diseases, which prone to systemic migratory infection. In this study, we collected 377 patients with community acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in our hospital from January 2013 to December 2018, 65.8% of whom were male, and 49.6% had DM. Patients with DM are prone to eye and central nervous system (CNS) infection, which need continuous local abscess drainage during treatment. Among them, patients with poor blood glucose control have a higher rate of blood stream infections (BSI). 219 strains of HvKP were obtained, with K1/K2 Serotype accounted for 81.7%. The incidence of BSI in K2 patients was higher than that in K1 patients. The PCR results indicate that the carrying rate of virulence genes (rmpA、areo、kfu、allS、iroN、magA、uge、wcaG) in K1/K2 type strains is significantly higher than that in non K1/K2 type strains. ST23 and ST65 are the most common multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which belong to K1 and K2 Serotype respectively. All of HvKP strains showed high sensitivity to commonly used clinical antibiotics other than ampicillin, with 54.3% of the strains exhibiting high viscosity characteristics. Meanwhile, 35 classic Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKP) strains were collected, and their serum typing is mainly non K1/K2. The carrying rate of virulence genes and viscosity degree in HvKP are significantly higher than those in cKP. Primary liver abscess caused by HvKP is prone to multiple tissue and organ infections, but it shows higher sensitivity to most commonly used antibiotics in clinical practice except for ampicillin. After effective treatment, the overall prognosis of patients is better. This study analyzes the pathogenic characteristics of HvKP and elaborates on the clinical characteristics of patients, which can provide reference for clinical and scientific research work.",['Jing Y; Yuan W; Lu-Ying X; Yong-Hong X'],2023,"invasive infection caused by hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported worldwide. most of the patients are community population, related to diabetes mellitus.

Investigating the efficacy of tissue factor pathway inhibitor‑2 as a promising prognostic marker for ovarian cancer.,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI2) is a tumor marker for diagnosing ovarian cancer and ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC); however, its effectiveness as a prognostic marker remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the utility of TFPI2 as a prognostic marker for ovarian cancer. A total of 256 cases of ovarian cancer was collected at Nara Medical University (Kashihara, Japan) from January 2008 to January 2022. The majority of cases were serous carcinoma (109, 42.6%), followed by OCCC (66, 25.8%), mucinous carcinoma (40, 15.6%), endometrial carcinoma (15, 5.9%), and other (26, 10.2%). The median preoperative serum TFPI2 for ovarian cancer was 219.0 (82.5-5,824.2) pg/ml. Overall survival (OS) of patients with non-OCCC and OCCC was calculated using the cut-off value determined obtained through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Cut-off values of TFPI2 for OS were 201 for non-OCCC and 255 pg/ml for OCCC. In univariate analysis, OS was significantly elevated in patients with non-OCCC and OCCC who had TFPI2 levels ≥201 pg/ml (P<0.001) and ≥255 pg/ml (P=0.036), respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly elevated in patients with non-OCCC and OCCC who had TFPI2 levels ≥201 and ≥255 pg/ml (both P<0.001), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that OS was significantly higher in patients with non-OCCC who had TFPI2 levels ≥201 pg/ml (P=0.021), while PFS was significantly higher in patients with OCCC who had TFPI2 levels ≥255 pg/ml (P=0.020).

"Critical roles of the miR-17∼92 family in thymocyte development, leukemogenesis, and autoimmunity.","Thymocyte development requires precise control of PI3K-Akt signaling to promote proliferation and prevent leukemia and autoimmune disorders. Here, we show that ablating individual clusters of the miR-17∼92 family has a negligible effect on thymocyte development, while deleting the entire family severely impairs thymocyte proliferation and reduces thymic cellularity, phenocopying genetic deletion of Dicer. Mechanistically, miR-17∼92 expression is induced by Myc-mediated pre-T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, and miR-17∼92 promotes thymocyte proliferation by suppressing the translation of Pten. Retroviral expression of miR-17∼92 restores the proliferation and differentiation of Myc-deficient thymocytes. Conversely, partial deletion of the miR-17∼92 family significantly delays Myc-driven leukemogenesis. Intriguingly, thymocyte-specific transgenic miR-17∼92 expression does not cause leukemia or lymphoma but instead aggravates skin inflammation, while ablation of the miR-17∼92 family ameliorates skin inflammation.

Effects of Satureja Khuzestanica supplementation on glycemic indices and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes patients: a randomized controlled clinical-trial.,"Several studies showed the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of Satureja Khuzestanica (SK) in animal models. This study aimed to determine the effect of SK supplementation on glycemic and lipid outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study was designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial using block randomization. Seventy-eight T2DM patients were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 39) or placebo (n = 39) groups. They received SK or placebo in 500 mg capsules daily for 12 weeks. Anthropometric, blood pressure, liver enzymes, glycemic, and lipid outcomes were measured before and after the intervention. At baseline, there were no significant differences in age, sex, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between the groups.

"Biosynthesis, characterization, and anticoagulant properties of copper nanoparticles from red seaweed of Acanthophora sp.","In the last few decades, nanoparticles have found extensive use in a variety of biological applications. Traditional medicine widely uses Acanthophora sp., a marine macroalgae, to cure and prevent diabetes, skin disorders, and blood clotting. The present study aims to investigate whether green-synthesized copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) might work as an anticoagulant. The CuNPs were made using an environmentally friendly method that uses Acanthophora extract. We used UV-vis spectroscopy to assess the surface plasmon resonance of the material, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze its form, and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy to identify the material's constituent elements. Furthermore, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) determined the functional groups of the CuNPs. The biosynthesis of CuNPs was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy, which showed a surface plasmon resonance peak at 570 nm. The FT-IR analysis showed that certain functional groups are involved in the formation of CuNPs. These groups include OH stretching, C=O stretching, C-H bonding, C-N bonding, and Cu vibration. SEM analysis demonstrated the morphology of CuNPs synthesized, with a size of 0.5 μm, while EDS analysis confirmed their purity. The anticoagulant activity of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays showed that the clotting time got longer depending on the concentration. The CuNPs synthesized from Acanthophora had strong anticoagulant effects at 100 μg/mL, further suggesting that they might be useful as a natural blood thinner.

Breast Mass Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning Approaches on Two-Dimensional Mammogram: A Review.,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women, both in India and globally. The prevalence of breast masses is notably common in women aged 20 to 60. These breast masses are classified, according to the breast imaging-reporting and data systems (BI-RADS) standard, into categories such as fibroadenoma, breast cysts, benign, and malignant masses. To aid in the diagnosis of breast disorders, imaging plays a vital role, with mammography being the most widely used modality for detecting breast abnormalities over the years. However, the process of identifying breast diseases through mammograms can be time-consuming, requiring experienced radiologists to review a significant volume of images. Early detection of breast masses is crucial for effective disease management, ultimately reducing mortality rates. To address this challenge, advancements in image processing techniques, specifically utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), have tiled the way for the development of decision support systems. These systems assist radiologists in the accurate identification and classification of breast disorders. This paper presents a review of various studies where diverse machine learning approaches have been applied to digital mammograms. These approaches aim to identify breast masses and classify them into distinct subclasses such as normal, benign and malignant. Additionally, the paper highlights both the advantages and limitations of existing techniques, offering valuable insights for the benefit of future research endeavors in this critical area of medical imaging and breast health.",['Shankari N; Kudva V; Hegde RB'],2024,"breast masses are classified into categories such as fibroadenoma, breast cysts, benign, and malignant masses. mammography is the most widely used modality for detecting breast abnormalities over the years. early detection of breast diseases through mammograms can be time-consuming."
NOD2 contributes to Parvimonas micra-induced bone resorption in diabetic rats with experimental periodontitis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may affect the oral microbial community, exacerbating periodontal inflammation; however, its pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. As nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) plays a crucial role in the activation during periodontitis (PD), it is hypothesized that changes in the oral microbial community due to diabetes enhance periodontal inflammation through the activation of NOD2. We collected subgingival plaque from 180 subjects who were categorized into two groups based on the presence or absence of T2DM. The composition of oral microbiota was detected by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. In animal models of PD with or without T2DM, we assessed alveolar bone resorption by micro-computerized tomography and used immunohistochemistry to detect NOD2 expression in alveolar bone. Primary osteoblasts were cultured in osteogenic induction medium with high or normal glucose and treated with inactivated bacteria. After 24 h of inactivated bacteria intervention, the osteogenic differentiation ability was detected by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and the expressions of NOD2 and interleukin-12 (IL-6) were detected by western blot. The relative abundance of Parvimonas and Filifactor in the T2DM group was increased compared to the group without T2DM. In animal models, alveolar bone mass was decreased in PD, particularly in T2DM with PD (DMPD) group, compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed NOD2 in osteoblasts from the alveolar bone in both the PD group and DMPD group, especially in the DMPD group. In vitro, intervention with inactivated Parvimonas significantly reduced ALP secretion of primary osteoblasts in high glucose medium, accompanied by increased expression of NOD2 and IL-6. The results suggest that T2DM leading to PD may be associated with the activation of NOD2 by Parvimonas.",['Chen YY; Tan L; Su XL; Chen NX; Liu Q; Feng YZ; Guo Y'],2024,oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) plays a crucial role in the activation during periodontitis. a blot detected the expression of NOD2 in alveolar bone. the expression of NOD2 and interleukin-12 (IL-6) was detected.
The borderline effect for diabetes: when no difference makes a difference.,"We hypothesized that people at the borderline of being labeled as ""prediabetic"" based on A1c blood test results, who initially face equivalent risks of developing diabetes but who are labeled differently, would be more likely to develop diabetes when labeled as ""prediabetic"" as a result of the label. Study 1 served to establish the psychological effect of the prediabetes label: we surveyed 260 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test whether risk perception significantly increased when comparing A1c test results that differed by 0.1% and led to different diagnostic labels (5.6 and 5.7%) but did not significantly increase when comparing those that differed by 0.1% but received the same label (5.5%/5.6 and 5.7%/5.8%). Study 2 explored whether labels are associated with different rates of developing diabetes when the initial difference in A1c results suggests equivalent risk. Using data from 8,096 patients, we compared patients whose initial A1c results differed by 0.1% and found those who received results labeled as prediabetic (A1c of 5.7%) were significantly more likely to develop diabetes than patients whose initial results were labeled as normal (5.6%). In contrast, patients whose initial results differed by 0.1% but who received the same ""normal"" label (5.5 and 5.6%) were equally likely to develop diabetes. These preliminary results suggest that diagnostic labels may become self-fulfilling, especially when the underlying pathology of patients receiving different labels does not meaningfully differ.",['Aungle P; Langer E'],2024,study 1 compared patients who received results labeled as prediabetic. patients who received results labeled as normal were equally likely to develop diabetes.
The association between non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio with type 2 diabetes mellitus: recent findings from NHANES 2007-2018.,"This study aims to assess the relationship between NHHR (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in US adults, using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2007 to 2018. This study explored the connection between NHHR and T2DM by analyzing a sample reflecting the adult population of the United States (n = 10,420; NHANES 2007-2018). NHHR was characterized as the ratio of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. T2DM was defined based on clinical guidelines. This research used multivariable logistic models to examine the connection between NHHR and T2DM. Additionally, it included subgroup and interaction analyses to assess variations among different groups. Generalized additive models, smooth curve fitting, and threshold effect analysis were also employed to analyze the data further. The study included 10,420 subjects, with 2160 diagnosed with T2DM and 8260 without. The weighted multivariate logistic regression model indicated an 8% higher probability of T2DM for each unit increase in NHHR (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01-1.15) after accounting for all covariates. Subgroup analysis outcomes were uniform across various categories, demonstrating a significant positive relationship between NHHR and T2DM. Interaction tests showed that the positive link between NHHR and T2DM remained consistent regardless of age, body mass index, smoking status, moderate recreational activities, hypertension, or stroke history, with all interaction P-values exceeding 0.05. However, participants' sex appeared to affect the magnitude of the connection between NHHR and T2DM (interaction P-value < 0.05). Also, a nonlinear association between NHHR and T2DM was discovered, featuring an inflection point at 1.50. Our study suggests that an increase in NHHR may be correlated with a heightened likelihood of developing T2DM. Consequently, NHHR could potentially serve as a marker for estimating the probability of T2DM development.",['Tan MY; Weng L; Yang ZH; Zhu SX; Wu S; Su JH'],2024,study aims to assess the relationship between NHHR and T2DM in adults.

Socio-behavioral determinants of health-related quality of life among patients with type 2 diabetes: comparison between 2015 and 2018.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common chronic disease that significantly affects an individual's overall health and well-being. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with T2D. This study conducted using data from 6th phase (2015-2017) and 7th phase (2018-2022) of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Data were collected through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Quality of life questionnaire (SF-12) that consists of 12 questions was used to assess physical and mental health functioning. The generalized estimating equation model was used to assess the association between socio-behavioral factors and changes in HRQoL. The study included 498 patients with T2D. The changes in HRQoL in patients with T2D followed a sex-specific pattern. Analysis of the physical component score (PCS) and the mental component score (MCS) showed a non-significant change in the total score during the three-year longitudinal study. However, the role physical (RP) of the PCS and the social functioning (SF) of the MCS showed a statistically significant change during this period. In addition, sex, body mass index (BMI), and having cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed a significant association with RP changes, and only job status showed a significant association with SF changes. By recognizing the sex-specific patterns in HRQoL changes and understanding the multifaceted nature of factors such as BMI, CVD and CKD, healthcare professionals can develop targeted interventions that go beyond traditional diabetes management.",['Izadi N; Shafiee A; Niknam M; Yari-Boroujeni R; Azizi F; Amiri P'],2024,"study conducted using data from 6th phase (2015-2017) and 7th phase (2018-2022) of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. data were collected through a combination of interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests."
Mitophagy at the crossroads of cancer development: Exploring the role of mitophagy in tumor progression and therapy resistance.,"Preserving a functional mitochondrial network is crucial for cellular well-being, considering the pivotal role of mitochondria in ensuring cellular survival, especially under stressful conditions. Mitophagy, the selective removal of damaged mitochondria through autophagy, plays a pivotal role in preserving cellular homeostasis by preventing the production of harmful reactive oxygen species from dysfunctional mitochondria. While the involvement of mitophagy in neurodegenerative diseases has been thoroughly investigated, it is becoming increasingly evident that mitophagy plays a significant role in cancer biology. Perturbations in mitophagy pathways lead to suboptimal mitochondrial quality control, catalyzing various aspects of carcinogenesis, including establishing metabolic plasticity, stemness, metabolic reconfiguration of cancer-associated fibroblasts, and immunomodulation. While mitophagy performs a delicate balancing act at the intersection of cell survival and cell death, mounting evidence indicates that, particularly in the context of stress responses induced by cancer therapy, it predominantly promotes cell survival. Here, we showcase an overview of the current understanding of the role of mitophagy in cancer biology and its potential as a target for cancer therapy. Gaining a more comprehensive insight into the interaction between cancer therapy and mitophagy has the potential to reveal novel targets and pathways, paving the way for enhanced treatment strategies for therapy-resistant tumors in the near future.",['Deepak K; Roy PK; Das CK; Mukherjee B; Mandal M'],2024,mitophagy is the selective removal of damaged mitochondria through autophagy. it prevents the production of harmful reactive oxygen species from dysfunctional mitochondria. mitophagy plays a key role in cancer biology.
Evaluating the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin addition to insulin and oral antidiabetic medication (OAD) regimen in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and obese patients.,"Insulin resistance complicates diabetes care. Its effectiveness and tolerability as an addition to metformin, DPP4 inhibitor and insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients will be examined in this research. Participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values ≥8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. They received 10mg Empagliflozin daily for 12 weeks (n=143). The main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12<sup>th</sup> week from baseline. Secondary outcomes were baseline weight and week 12 FPG. Adjusted mean (SE) HbA1c increases at week 12 were: Mean ± SD 10.38 (6.8-17.0) vs. Mean±SD 9.05±1.77 (5.60-16.0) with empagliflozin 10mg. When added to the regimen, empagliflozin significantly reduced FPG, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The mean (SE) BMI increases from baseline were 31.28±5.89 (16.0-66.0) and 29.73±5.47 (3.0-46.0) with 10mg empagliflozin. Two individuals experienced urinary tract infections as AEs, but no genital infections. Adding empagliflozin 10mg daily to metformin+DPP4 inhibitor+insulin improved glycemic control, body weight and blood pressure for 12 weeks. The intervention was well-tolerated, highlighting empagliflozin's therapeutic potential.",['Sharif H; Sheikh SS; Salman A; Jawed Z; Karim I; Sohail T; Mohsin N'],2024,participants with type 2 diabetes from poor socio-economic backgrounds had HbA1c values 8.5% when using Insulin+Metformin+DPP-4 inhibitors. the main outcome was change in HbA1c at 12sup>th/sup> week from baseline.
Trends in Survival After First Myocardial Infarction in People With Diabetes.,"The aim of this study was to investigate temporal trends in survival and subsequent cardiovascular events in a nationwide myocardial infarction population with and without diabetes. Between 2006 and 2020, we identified 2527 individuals with type 1 diabetes, 48 321 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 243 170 individuals without diabetes with first myocardial infarction in national health care registries. Outcomes were trends in all-cause death after 30 and 365 days, cardiovascular death and major adverse cardiovascular events (ie, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and heart failure hospitalization). Pseudo-observations were used to estimate the mortality risk, with 95% CIs, using linear regression, adjusted for age and sex. Individuals with type 1 diabetes were younger (62±12.2 years) and more often women (43.6%) compared with individuals with type 2 diabetes (75±10.8 years; women, 38.1%), and individuals without diabetes (73±13.2 years; women, 38.4%). Early death decreased in people without diabetes from 23.1% to 17.5%, (annual change -0.48% [95% CI, -0.52% to -0.44%]) and in people with type 2 diabetes from 22.6% to 19.3% (annual change, -0.33% [95% CI, -0.43% to -0.24%]), with no such significant trend in people with type 1 diabetes from 23.8% to 21.7% (annual change, -0.18% [95% CI, -0.53% to 0.17%]). Similar trends were observed with regard to 1-year death, cardiovascular death, and major adverse cardiovascular events. During the past 15 years, the trend in survival and major adverse cardiovascular events in people with first myocardial infarction without diabetes and with type 2 diabetes have improved significantly. In contrast, a similar improvement was not seen in people with type 1 diabetes.",['Glynn L; Lind M; Andersson T; Eliasson B; Hofmann R; Nyström T'],2024,"between 2006 and 2020, we identified 2527 individuals with type 1 diabetes. 48 321 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 243 170 individuals without diabetes with first myocardial infarction in national health care registries."
Risk of Head and Neck Cancer in Patients with Psoriasis: A Nationwide Population-based Study.,"An association between psoriasis and cancer risk has been suggested in prior studies, but few have focused on head and neck cancers. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, the relevance between psoriasis and head and neck cancer risks was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 3,869,264 individuals over 20 years of age, who received general health examination in 2009 and were followed until 2020. Head and neck cancer incidence rates were compared between individuals with and without psoriasis, and contributing factors were analysed. The head and neck cancer risk was significantly increased in the psoriasis group compared with the non-psoriasis group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.74; p = 0.01) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, income, smoking, alcohol, exercise, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. The risk was especially elevated for nasopharyngeal (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.12-3.70; p = 0.02) and salivary gland cancer (HR 1.96; 95% CI 1.08-3.56; p = 0.03). Alcohol consumption significantly influenced the risk, particularly for oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancer. Our study provides insights into the potential risks of head and neck cancer in patients with psoriasis, which could aid in refining patient management strategies.",['Huh G; Kim D; Lee KN; Han K; Cho JH'],2024,"study of 3,869,264 people over 20 years of age investigated the relevance between psoriasis and head and neck cancer risks. the study was carried out by a cross-sectional study of 3,869,264 individuals over 20 years of age. the risk was significantly increased in the psoriasis group compared with the non-psoriasis group."
Bioinformatics screening of prognostic immune-related genes in renal clear cell carcinoma.,"This study aims to harness bioinformatics to identify prognostic immune-related genes in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), focusing particularly on LILRB3. It evaluates LILRB3's expression in ccRCC, its association with patient prognosis, and its potential as a biomarker for predicting survival, thereby providing a preliminary basis for the diagnosis of ccRCC. Utilizing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets and an immune gene set, we sought immune-related genes with elevated expression in ccRCC. Seventy-two normal tissue samples and 531 ccRCC samples were analyzed, and differential genes were identified with a screening criterion of fold change (FC) > 2 and P value < 0.01. Survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were employed to discover genes of prognostic and diagnostic relevance to ccRCC. Pearson correlation analysis with a cutoff of |r|≥ 0.5, facilitated by cBioPortal, assessed genes co-expressed with LILRB3. The DAVID online tool conducted functional and pathway enrichment analyses for LILRB3-coexpressed genes. The TIMER and TCIA databases were utilized to explore LILRB3's influence on immune infiltration in the tumor microenvironment and its relation to key immunological checkpoints. Screening the TCGA database revealed 3719 up-regulated differential genes in ccRCC, with 355 overlapping immune-related genes. Survival analysis of these 355 genes revealed 100 with significant survival impact. ROC curve analysis pinpointed the top 10 genes, including LILRB3, with the highest diagnostic efficiency. LILRB3 emerged as an independent risk factor from the Cox risk regression model. GO and KEGG analyses linked LILRB3 to various biological processes, including chemokine signaling pathways, immunological response, antigen processing and presentation, inflammatory response, T cell co-stimulation, and signal transduction. LILRB3 significantly affected ccRCC immune infiltration and correlated positively with several immunological checkpoints, such as PD-1, LAG3, IDO1, PD-L1, CTLA4, TIM3, TIGIT, and VISTA. LILRB3 shows higher expression levels in ccRCC than in normal tissues and correlates with poor patient prognosis. Its impactful role in the immune infiltration of the RCC microenvironment suggests that LILRB3 could serve as a novel target for ccRCC treatment and prognosis, underlining its diagnostic and prognostic significance.",['Cui K; Song H; Zhang H; Sun P'],2024,ccRCC is a clear cell renal cell carcinoma. it is a biomarker for predicting survival. survival analysis and ROC curve analysis were employed to identify genes of prognostic and diagnostic relevance to ccRCC.
TIMP-1 is an activator of MHC-I expression in myeloid dendritic cells with implications for tumor immunogenicity.,"Immune checkpoint therapies (ICT) for advanced solid tumors mark a new milestone in cancer therapy. Yet their efficacy is often limited by poor immunogenicity, attributed to inadequate priming and generation of antitumor T cells by dendritic cells (DCs). Identifying biomarkers to enhance DC functions in such tumors is thus crucial. Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), recognized for its influence on immune cells, has an underexplored relationship with DCs. Our research reveals a correlation between high TIMP1 levels in metastatic melanoma and increased CD8 + T cell infiltration and survival. Network studies indicate a functional connection with HLA genes. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of a national melanoma cohort revealed that TIMP1 expression in immune compartments associates with an HLA-A/MHC-I peptide loading signature in lymph nodes. Primary human and bone-marrow-derived DCs secrete TIMP-1, which notably increases MHC-I expression in classical type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1), especially under melanoma antigen exposure. TIMP-1 affects the immunoproteasome/TAP complex, as seen by upregulated PSMB8 and TAP-1 levels of myeloid DCs. This study uncovers the role of TIMP-1 in DC-mediated immunogenicity with insights into CD8 + T cell activation, providing a foundation for mechanistic exploration and highlighting its potential as a new target for combinatorial immunotherapy to enhance ICT effectiveness.",['Langguth M; Maranou E; Koskela SA; Elenius O; Kallionpää RE; Birkman EM; Pulkkinen OI; Sundvall M; Salmi M; Figueiredo CR'],2024,TIMP-1 has an underexplored relationship with DCs. a correlation between high TIMP1 levels in metastatic melanoma and increased CD8 + T cell infiltration and survival.
The Role of Neurotoxins and Fillers in Affirmative Care in Gender Nonconforming Filipino Patients.,"Gender nonconformity refers to individuals whose gender identity, roles, or expressions do not adhere to societal standards and norms. Affirmative care is an approach to healthcare delivery in which organizations, programs, and providers recognize, validate, and support the identity stated or expressed by the individuals served. This study examined the effects of nonsurgical interventions performed by dermatologists, specifically botulinum toxins (BoNTA) and dermal filler injections, on the physical and mental health of Filipino gender nonconforming individuals. Six gender nonconforming patients received filler and BoNTA injections to enhance their desired facial features. The patients were interviewed before and three months after the treatment session. Baseline and three months posttreatment photos were used to examine treatment results, including the facial width-to-height ratio (FWHR). Three months after treatment, the patients answered a five-question Likert-scale satisfaction survey. Patients reported high satisfaction with the treatment outcomes (median=5) and agreed that the treatment met their expectations (median=5). They reported improved fine lines and wrinkles (median=5) and increased self-confidence (median=5). All participants strongly recommended the treatment to others (median=5). Changes in FWHR varied among participants who requested a feminine appearance, except for one participant who sought a masculine appearance and whose FWHR increased. Sensitivity, openness, and knowledge regarding the facial aspirations and treatment preferences of gender nonconforming patients can improve outcomes and increase patient satisfaction in this patient population.",['Yu JN; Angeles C; Bueser H; Sison A'],2024,six gender nonconforming patients received filler and BoNTA injections. patients reported high satisfaction with treatment outcomes. changes in FWHR varied among participants who requested a feminine appearance.
Magnoflorine Ameliorates Chronic Kidney Disease in High-Fat and High-Fructose-Fed Mice by Promoting Parkin/PINK1-Dependent Mitophagy to Inhibit NLRP3/Caspase-1-Mediated Pyroptosis.,"Excessive intake of fat and fructose in Western diets has been confirmed to induce renal lipotoxicity, thereby driving the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of magnoflorine in a CKD mouse model subjected to high-fat and high-fructose diets. Our results demonstrated that magnoflorine treatment ameliorated abnormal renal function indices (serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, uric acid, and urine protein) in high-fat- and high-fructose-fed mice. Histologically, renal tubular cell steatosis, lipid deposition, tubular dilatation, and glomerular fibrosis were significantly reduced by the magnoflorine treatment in these mice. Mechanistically, magnoflorine promotes Parkin/PINK1-mediated mitophagy, thereby inhibiting NLRP3/Caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis. Consistent findings were observed in the palmitic acid-incubated HK-2 cell model. Notably, both silencing of Parkin and the use of a mitophagy inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of magnoflorine on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in vitro. Therefore, the present study provides compelling evidence that magnoflorine improves renal injury in high-fat- and high-fructose-fed mice by promoting Parkin/PINK1-dependent mitophagy to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. Our findings suggest that dietary supplementation with magnoflorine and magnoflorine-rich foods (such as magnolia) might be an effective strategy for the prevention of CKD.",['Cheng Y; Lu Z; Mao T; Song Y; Qu Y; Chen X; Chen K; Liu K; Zhang C'],2024,"magnoflorine treatment in high-fat and high-fructose-fed mice. renal tubular cell steatosis, tubular dilatation, and glomerular fibrosis were significantly reduced by the magnoflorine treatment."
Disruption of memory B-cell trafficking by belimumab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,"Autoreactive memory B cells contribute to chronic and progressive courses in autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The efficacy of belimumab (BEL), the first approved biologic treatment for SLE and lupus nephritis (LN), is generally attributed to depletion of activated naïve B cells and inhibition of B cell activation. BEL's effect on memory B cells (MBCs) is currently unexplained. We performed an in-depth cellular and transcriptomic analysis of BEL's impact on the blood MBC compartment in patients with SLE. A retrospective meta-analysis was conducted, pooling flow cytometry data from four randomized trials involving 1245 patients with SLE treated with intravenous BEL or placebo. Then, extensive MBC phenotyping was performed using high-sensitivity flow cytometry in patients with mild/moderate SLE and severe SLE/LN treated with subcutaneous BEL. Finally, transcriptomic characterization of surging MBCs was performed by single-cell RNA sequencing. In BEL-treated patients, a significant increase in circulating MBCs, in a broad range of MBC subsets, was established at week 2, gradually returning to baseline by week 52. The increase was most prominent in patients with higher SLE disease activity, serologically active patients, and patients aged ≤18 years. MBCs had a non-proliferating phenotype with a prominent decrease in activation status and downregulation of numerous migration genes. Upon BEL initiation, an increase of MBCs was firmly established. In the small cohort investigated, circulating MBCs were de-activated, non-proliferative, and demonstrated characteristics of disrupted lymphocyte trafficking, expanding on our understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of B cell-activating factor inhibition by BEL.

Influence of preoperative urine culture and bacterial species on urogenital sepsis after ureteral flexible lithotripsy in patients with upper urinary tract stones.,"This retrospective study aims to identify risk factors for urogenic sepsis in patients with upper urinary tract stones following ureteral flexible lithotripsy (FURL). Additionally, we analyze the clinical characteristics of bacterial infections post-surgery. A total of 759 patients who underwent FURL at the Urology Department of Zunyi Medical University were included. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors for urogenic sepsis post-FURL. The distribution of bacteria based on preoperative urine cultures was also analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using R4.2.2 software. Of the 759 patients, positive preoperative urine culture, urine nitrite positivity, urine white blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 200 cells/μL, residual stones, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were found to be independent risk factors for urogenic sepsis after FURL. Among the 164 patients with positive preoperative urine cultures, 32 developed urogenic sepsis post-surgery, with 68.75% having positive preoperative cultures. The leading pathogens causing postoperative urogenic sepsis were <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>), <i>Enterococcus faecium</i>, <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>, and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>. The probabilities of progression to urogenic sepsis were as follows: <i>E. coli</i> 19% (<i>n</i> = 12), <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> 43% (<i>n</i> = 3), <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> 33.3% (<i>n</i> = 1), and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> 33.3% (<i>n</i> = 1). The ages of affected patients were 47.17 ± 13.2, 53.7, 41, and 79 years, respectively. Rates of comorbid diabetes were 36.4, 66.7, 50, 100%, with nitrite positivity rates at 72.7, 33.3, 50, 0%. Ten female patients were infected with <i>E. coli</i>, while patients infected with <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> had an NLR of 7.62. Positive preoperative urine culture, urine nitrite positivity, urine WBC ≥ 200 cells/μL, residual stones, and NLR are independent risk factors for urogenic sepsis after FURL. <i>Escherichia coli</i> is the predominant pathogen post-FURL, with notable female prevalence and nitrite-positive urine in infections. <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> infections are associated with diabetes.",['Wang L; Yu X; Qiu Z; Liu P; Tian W; He W; Pan Y; Xu F; Cen Z; Ou Y; Li D'],2024,retrospective study aims to identify risk factors for urogenic sepsis in patients with upper urinary tract stones following ureteral flexible lithotripsy (FURL). a total of 759 patients who underwent FURL were included.
MRI Differential Diagnosis and Guidance for Puncture Biopsy of Musculoskeletal Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma and Well Differentiated Liposarcoma.,"The study aimed to investigate the significantly different imaging characteristics of musculoskeletal dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLP) and well differentiated liposarcoma (WDLP) on MRI, which in turn could guide puncture biopsy. This study included 14 patients with DDLP and 16 patients with WDLP, all of whom were confirmed by histopathological examination. The MRI manifestations of these two pathologies were retrospectively reviewed and compared. Furthermore, a step-by-step procedure regarding preoperative puncture biopsy of fatty masses that are suspicious for WD/DD was designed. Fatty signals can be found in almost all WDs, with a greater proportion of non-fatty areas in DD compared to WD, and it is reasonable to consider WD more likely when the non-fatty areas of the tumor are <25% (p < 0.05), while it is reasonable to consider DD more likely when the non-fatty areas of the tumor are >50% (p < 0.05), and the MRI signals in DD are more complex, inhomogeneous (p < 0.01), usually showed significant enhancement (p < 0.01), and the margins of the tumor were usually indistinct (p < 0.01); and imaging features such as tumor size, vascularity, necrosis, and peritumoral edema did not serve as distinguishing features between the two (p > 0.05). DD has a greater proportion of non-fatty components, with more complex and inhomogeneous MRI signals, and typically shows significant enhancement, with usually indistinct margins of the tumor, in which the inhomogeneous manifestations are associated with the histological components.

The association of gender-affirming hormone therapy duration and body mass index on bone mineral density in gender diverse adults.,"Feminizing and masculinizing gender-affirming hormone therapy (fGAHT, mGAHT) results in bone mineral density (BMD) maintenance or improvement over time in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adults. Mostly European TGD studies have explored GAHT's impact on BMD, but the association of BMI and BMD in TGD adults deserves further study. To determine whether GAHT duration or BMI are associated with BMD and Z-scores among TGD young adults. Cross-sectional study of nonsmoking TGD adults aged 18-40 years without prior gonadectomy or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) therapy taking GAHT for > 1 year. BMD and Z-scores were collected from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Associations between femoral neck, total hip, and lumbar spine BMDs and Z-scores and the predictors, GAHT duration and BMI, were estimated using linear regression. Among 15 fGAHT and 15 mGAHT, mean BMIs were 27.6 +/- standard deviation (SD) 6.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 25.3 +/- 5.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Both groups had mean BMDs and Z-scores within expected male and female reference ranges at all three sites. Higher BMI among mGAHT was associated with higher femoral neck and total hip BMDs (femoral neck: β = 0.019 +/- standard error [SE] 0.007 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, total hip: β = 0.017 +/- 0.006 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; both p < 0.05) and Z-scores using male and female references. GAHT duration was not associated with BMDs or Z-scores for either group. Z-scores in young, nonsmoking TGD adults taking GAHT for > 1 year, without prior gonadectomy or GnRHa, and with mean BMIs in the overweight range, were reassuringly within the expected ranges for age based on male and female references. Higher BMI, but not longer GAHT duration, was associated with higher femoral neck and total hip BMDs and Z-scores among mGAHT. Larger, prospective studies are needed to understand how body composition changes, normal or low BMIs, and gonadectomy affect bone density in TGD adults.",['Iwamoto SJ; Rice JD; Moreau KL; Cornier MA; Wierman ME; Mancuso MP; Gebregzabheir A; Hammond DB; Rothman MS'],2024,feminizing and masculinizing gender-affirming hormone therapy results in bone mineral density (BMD) maintenance or improvement over time in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adults. mainly european studies have explored GAHT's impact on BMD.
Liquiritigenin Induces Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Liquiritigenin (LQ), as a dihydroflavone monomer compound extracted from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch, has been demonstrated to show anti-tumor effects in multiple human cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma. Our study aimed to explore its role in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) development and the related mechanism. The effects of LQ on SK-MES-1 and NCI-H520 cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were investigated. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony formation assays revealed that LQ inhibited LSCC cell viability and proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that LQ promoted G2/M cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In vivo assays showed that LQ administration suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Additionally, LQ treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, and mTOR levels in LSCC cells. Pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 antagonized the LQ-mediated effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in LSCC cells. Collectively, LQ induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in LSCC by inactivating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",['Liu Y; Wang Y; Yang Y; Quan Y; Guo M'],2024,"a squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) development is a complex complex. the effects of LQ on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were investigated."
Adjuvant-induced arthritis promotes vascular hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine through a nitric oxide-related mechanism.,"Arthritis has important cardiovascular repercussions. Phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction is impaired in rat aortas in the early phase of the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA), around the 15th day post-induction. Therefore, the present study aimed to verify the effects of AIA on hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine in rat aortas. AIA was induced by intradermal injection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (3.8 mg/dL) in the right hind paw of male Wistar rats (n=27). Functional experiments in isolated aortas were carried out 15 days after AIA induction. Morphometric and stereological analyses of the aortas were also performed 36 days after the induction of AIA. AIA did not promote structural modifications in the aortas at any of the time points studied. AIA reduced phenylephrine-induced contraction in endothelium-intact aortas, but not in endothelium-denuded aortas. However, AIA did not change KCl-induced contraction in either endothelium-intact or denuded aortas. L-NAME (non-selective NOS inhibitor), 1400W (selective iNOS inhibitor), and ODQ (guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) reversed AIA-induced hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine in intact aortas. 7-NI (selective nNOS inhibitor) increased the contraction induced by phenylephrine in aortas from AIA rats. In summary, the hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine induced by AIA was endothelium-dependent and mediated by iNOS-derived NO through activation of the NO-guanylyl cyclase pathway.",['Araujo TS; Spadella MA; Carlos CP; Tirapelli CR; Chagas EFB; Pinheiro JCD; Chies AB'],2024,phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction is impaired in rat aortas. the study aimed to verify the effects of AIA on hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine in rat aortas.
[Hyperthyroidism - a classic disease].,"Hyperthyroidism presents with various forms of generalized symptoms. Primary care physicians as well as other specialists should have this in mind when meeting patients with symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, fatigue and weight loss. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a highly specific test and useful in ruling out hyperthyroidism. The severity of the disease determines the pace of management. Primary care is often involved in detection of hyperthyroidism but also takes part in the work of rehabilitation and the lifelong hormonal substitution that is necessary for 2/3 of all patients. Subclinical hyperthyroidism, characterized by low TSH levels but normal levels of T4 and T3, is associated with increased mortality by 24 percent and risks of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis. Treatment depends on age, presence of comorbidity and TSH-levels. In addition to specific endocrinological treatment, person-centered care is crucial during active disease and rehabilitation. The first Swedish care program for hyperthyroidism aims to enhance care efficiency and equity.",['Fellbrant K; Shahedi Razavi K; Lindgren O; Filipsson Nyström H'],2024,hyperthyroidism presents with various forms of generalized symptoms. primary care physicians and other specialists should have this in mind. the severity of the disease determines the pace of management.
CNOT7 regulates lipid deposition in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,"In recent years, the incidence rate of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has ascended with the increasing number of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, which will bring great medical burden to society. At present, multiple scientific experiments have found that the CCR4-NOT complex can participate in regulating obesity and energy metabolism. This study is designed to explore the role and mechanism of CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7 (CNOT7), a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex in liver lipid deposition. To establish the NAFLD cell model, palmitic acid (PA) was utilized to stimulate HepG2 cells and LO2 cells, promoting intracellular lipid deposition. CNOT7 was knockdown by siRNA and lentivirus to evaluate the effect of CNOT7 in NAFLD. Our results demonstrated that the expression of CNOT7 was increased in the NAFLD cell model. After knocking down CNOT7, the lipid deposition declined in HepG2 or LO2 cells treated by PA reduced. We found the lipid synthesis genes and the lipid uptake and transport factors in the CNOT7 knockdown group were significantly downregulated compared to the non-knockdown group. Furthermore, knockdown of CNOT7 might promote fatty acid oxidation. Knocking down CNOT7 can improve lipid deposition and CNOT7 may be a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.",['Li J; Wen W; Li J; Liu T; Sun J; Chen H'],2024,"the incidence rate of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has ascended with the increasing number of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. at present, multiple scientific experiments have found that the CCR4-NOT complex can participate in regulating obesity and energy metabolism."
Oxford Spine Buddies: an acceptability and feasibility project for peer-to-peer support in a spine sarcoma service.,"Primary bone and soft tissue sarcoma of the spine are rare and account for less than 0.2% of all neoplasm incidences. Following a patient and public involvement event, the need to explore patient support pathways was identified, which initiated this service evaluation project. To determine the acceptability and feasibility of a peer-to-peer support project among people using the spine sarcoma service. Users were paired and introduced via Microsoft Teams. Quantitative and qualitative data both pre- and post-introduction of a buddy were collected. Service users felt that, although they would have preferred having a buddy at the time of their diagnosis, being allocated a buddy made them feel reassured and better supported. The project was well received and preliminary data are encouraging.

Agent orange exposure and prostate cancer risk in the million veteran program.,"The US government considers veterans to have been exposed to Agent Orange if they served in Vietnam while the carcinogen was in use, and these veterans are often deemed at high risk of prostate cancer (PCa). Here, we assess whether presumed Agent Orange exposure is independently associated with increased risk of any metastatic or fatal PCa in a diverse Veteran cohort still alive in the modern era (at least 2011), when accounting for race/ethnicity, family history, and genetic risk. Participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP; enrollment began in 2011) who were on active duty during the Vietnam War era (August 1964-April 1975) were included (n = 301,470). Agent Orange exposure was determined using the US government definition. Genetic risk was assessed via a validated polygenic hazard score. Associations with age at diagnosis of any PCa, metastatic PCa, and death from PCa were assessed via Cox proportional hazards models. On univariable analysis, exposure to Agent Orange was not associated with increased PCa (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.04, p = 0.06), metastatic PCa (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.91-1.05, p = 0.55), or fatal PCa (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.79-1.09, p = 0.41). When accounting for race/ethnicity and family history, Agent Orange exposure was independently associated with slightly increased risk of PCa (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.04-1.09, <10-6) but not with metastatic PCa (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.98-1.15, p = 0.10) or PCa death (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.83-1.23, p = 0.09). Similar results were found when accounting for genetic risk.

Anamorelin for the Treatment of Cancer Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome.,"The following review will highlight the development of anamorelin to treat cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS) including the potential benefits, limitations, and future directions. Ghrelin, a 28-amino acid peptide hormone, is secreted by the stomach mucosa and regulates appetite, promotes lipogenesis, increases body weight, improves gastric motility, reduces catabolic wasting and inflammation. Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating anamorelin, a ghrelin agonist, for the treatment of CACS have reported improvement in appetite and body composition including both lean body and fat mass; however, most studies noted no improvement in physical function as assessed by measuring non-dominant hand-grip strength. Common adverse effects of anamorelin include the development of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, and less frequently, hepatic abnormalities and cardiovascular events including conduction abnormalities, hypertension, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Anamorelin has the potential to stimulate appetite, improve gastric movement, and may have anti-inflammatory effects on patients with CACS. In patients with cancer, studies involving anamorelin combined with other multimodal treatments including nutrition counseling (branched chain amino acids, omega 3 fatty acids, and other nutrients), exercise, treatment of hormonal abnormalities including hypogonadism and hypovitaminosis D, and anti-inflammatory agents are needed. Compliance with multimodality treatment has been a barrier and future studies may need to incorporate motivational counseling to promote adherence.",['Dev R; Amano K; Naito T; Del Fabbro E'],2024,"anamorelin is a 28-amino acid peptide hormone secreted by the stomach mucosa. it regulates appetite, promotes lipogenesis, increases body weight. it may have anti-inflammatory effects on patients with cancer."
"An ""out of the box"" approach for prevention of ketoacidosis in youth with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes: combined use of insulin pump and long-acting insulin.","Poorly controlled adolescents living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and pump failure of insulin delivery leading to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) are still challenging in the western world. To investigate the effect of a combination modality of long-acting insulin for basal coverage and a pump for boluses, on the incidence of DKA and glycemic parameters in pediatric and young adults with poorly controlled T1D. This multicenter, observational retrospective study included 55 patients (age range 3-25 years, 52.7% males) who were treated with the combination modality for a median of 18 months [(IQR)12,47], as part of their clinical care. Data were retrieved at initiation of the combined modality, after 6 months, and at last visit. Cohort's median age at combination modality initiation was 14.5 years [IQR12.4,17.3], and its median HbA1c level was 9.2% [IQR 8.2,10.2]. The main reasons for combination modality initiation were: (a) concern about sustained hyperglycemia on current management in 41.8%, (b) previous DKA episodes in 30.8%, and (c) refusal to wear a pump continuously in 14.6%. The percent of patients experiencing DKA who used the modality till end decreased from 25.4 to 8.8%. The frequency of DKA events per patient month decreased after 6 months from 0.073 (min 0, max 0.5) to 0.020 (min 0, max 0.5), p = 0.01, and at end to 0.016 (min 0, max 0.25), p = 0.007.

Clinical and Financial Outcomes of a Pilot Pharmacist-Led Continuous Glucose Monitoring Clinic.,"<i>Purpose:</i> What are the clinical and financial outcomes of patients using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of a pilot pharmacist-led service in a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)? <i>Methods:</i> This single-center, prospective cohort conducted in a FQHC from October 2022 to September 2023 was submitted to IRB for review [EXMT-P-22-F-17]. Patients were seen by a pharmacist in collaboration with an attending physician during diabetes specific visits. A total of 15 patients were seen in the pharmacist-led clinic (5 males and 10 females). While follow-up visits were scheduled in-person every 3 months to obtain a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), patients could also be seen in the clinic for additional visits. Reimbursement rates were analyzed to determine financial outcomes of the pharmacy service. <i>Results:</i> Pharmacists saw 15 patients for their initial CGM visits, with 8 patients returning for follow-up. The average HbA1c at the first visit was 10% ± 2.49 and decreased at the last follow-up to 8.05% ± 0.29. Time in range (TIR) was obtained for 8 patients through the CGM device or online data monitoring. The average TIR 2 weeks after the first pharmacist visit was 39.625% ± 23.19 and increased to 48.75% ± 11.41 at the completion of the project. A total of 39 visits were conducted, with a total reimbursement rate of $5,978.54. <i>Conclusion:</i> This pharmacist-led pilot CGM clinic showed improvements in clinical outcomes and provided financial reimbursement for diabetes management in addition to typical office visit revenue. Further research should focus on clinical impact of pharmacist-led continuous glucose monitor clinics in larger patient populations, as well as financial sustainability of the service in both physician clinics and FQHC's.",['Ballard L; York AL; Skelley JW; Sims M'],2024,patients were seen by a pharmacist in collaboration with an attending physician during diabetes specific visits. a total of 15 patients were seen in the pharmacist-led clinic (5 males and 10 females) a total of 15 patients were seen in the pharmacist-led clinic.
Genetic Associations with C-peptide Levels before Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis in At-Risk Relatives.,"We sought to determine whether the type 1 diabetes genetic risk score-2 (T1D-GRS2) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with C-peptide preservation before type 1 diabetes diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 713 autoantibody-positive participants who developed type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study who had T1DExomeChip data. We evaluated the relationships of 16 known SNPs and T1D-GRS2 with area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide levels during oral glucose tolerance tests conducted in the 9 months before diagnosis. Higher T1D-GRS2 was associated with lower C-peptide AUC in the 9 months before diagnosis in univariate (β=-0.06, P<0.0001) and multivariate (β=-0.03, P=0.005) analyses. Participants with the JAZF1 rs864745 T allele had lower C-peptide AUC in both univariate (β=-0.11, P=0.002) and multivariate (β=-0.06, P=0.018) analyses.

Curcumin Mitigates Streptozotocin-Induced Genotoxicity In Vivo by Activating P53 Protein and Inhibiting Oxidative Stress and Chromosomal Aberration.,"Genotoxins are chemical constituents that damage DNA or chromosomal architecture, leading to alterations in the genetic level. Streptozotocin, a monofunctional nitrosourea derivative, is often utilized to induce diabetes mellitus in laboratory animals because of its detrimental effects on pancreatic cells. The purpose of this work was to investigate possible protective efficacy against the genotoxic effects of Streptozotocin. This study examines the potentiality of curcumin, a phytoproduct with anti-genotoxic and anti-diabetic qualities, against streptozotocin-induced chromosomal abnormalities and DNA damage. The study evaluates the possible protective efficacy of curcumin, exploring a variety of biochemical and molecular biology techniques in murine models. The experiment involves a control group, the administration of Streptozotocin (Group S), and a curcumin-pretreated STZ group (Group SC) in mice. The effects of curcumin on DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations were investigated by histopathology, immunofluorescence, evaluation of chromosomal aberrations, detection of Reactive oxygen species, cell viability analysis, and DNA laddering assay. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in DNA damage, chromosomal anomalies, and a decrease in the expression of the p53 protein in the curcumin-treated animals compared to that of STZ-treated mice. The overall results show that curcumin can reduce chromosomal aberrations and DNA damage by altering the expression of p53 repair proteins. This suggests that curcumin has a promising future as a therapeutic agent, especially when it comes to drug-induced toxicity and the development of novel therapeutics.",['Saha A; Chakrovorty A; Bhattacharjee B; Nandi S; Samadder A'],2024,curcumin is a phytoproduct with anti-genotoxic and anti-diabetic qualities. curcumin can reduce chromosomal aberrations and chromosomal aberrations. curcumin can reduce chromosomal aberrations compared to that of STZ-treated mice.
Factors associated to hemoglobin decrease after percutaneous nephrolithotomy: a retrospective study.,"This study aims to determine the preoperative and perioperative risk parameters associated with a decrease in hemoglobin (Hb) in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). We collected prospective data of consecutive patients who underwent PCNL from January 2018 to December 2022. The median decrease in post-operative hemoglobin levels compared to pre-operative was found to be 1.5 g/dl. This value was the cut-off value that divided the sample into two groups. Group 1 has a decrease in Hb levels that is higher or equal to the cutoff, group 2 has a decrease in Hb levels that is lower than the cut-off. All preoperative, stone characteristics and perioperative factors were recorded. A total of 273 patients were included in the study, 141 in Group 1 and 132 in Group 2. The mean age of Group 1 was significantly higher (55.48 ± 8.73 vs 45.9 ± 10.75 years, p < 0.05). The mean bleeding of Group 1 was significantly higher (285.85 ± 113.68 vs 135 ± 77.54 ml, p < 0.05). There was a significant difference in mean operation time between groups (86.35 ± 32.05 vs 64.89 ± 27.83 min, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the variables age, comorbid diabetes mellitus, intraoperative bleeding amount, and operation time had a significant relationship with Hb reduction in patients undergoing PCNL (p < 0.05).

Factors and clinical prediction score for complication development after cellulitis diagnosis in adult patients.,"Cellulitis is defined as a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that can cause multiple complications, such as sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis. In extreme cases, it may lead to multiorgan failure and death. We sought to analyze the clinical factors that contribute to the development of complicated disease, including demographics, clinical presentation, initial vital signs, and laboratory studies. Our study is a retrospective cohort study carried out in a university-based tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Adult patients who presented with cellulitis from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022, were evaluated for eligibility and inclusion in this study. All related variables for both outcomes, bacteremia and necrotizing fasciitis, were gathered from electronic medical records and analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Of the 1,560 visits to this hospital, 47 cases reported at least one complication, with bacteremia noted in 27 visits (1.73%) and necrotizing fasciitis in 20 visits (1.27%). From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, six variables emerge as predictors of cellulitis complications. These are: Age ≥ 65 years, Body Mass Index ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, diabetes mellitus, body temperature ≥ 38 °C, systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mmHg, and involvement of lower extremities. The predictive score was developed from these factors and was named the Ramathibodi Necrotizing Fasciitis/Bacteremia (RAMA-NFB) Prediction Score. Our predictive score has an accuracy of 82.93% (95% CI, 0.77-0.89). Patients in the high-risk group (RAMA NFB score > 6) have a likelihood ratio of 8.75 (95% CI, 4.41-18.12; p < 0.001) times to develop complications of cellulitis.

sEMG-based automatic characterization of swallowed materials.,"Monitoring of ingestive activities is critically important for managing the health and wellness of individuals with various health conditions, including the elderly, diabetics, and individuals seeking better weight control. Monitoring swallowing events can be an ideal surrogate for developing streamlined methods for effective monitoring and quantification of eating or drinking events. Swallowing is an essential process for maintaining life. This seemingly simple process is the result of coordinated actions of several muscles and nerves in a complex fashion. In this study, we introduce automated methods for the detection and quantification of various eating and drinking activities. Wireless surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to detect chewing and swallowing from sEMG signals obtained from the sternocleidomastoid muscle, in addition to signals obtained from a wrist-mounted IMU sensor. A total of 4675 swallows were collected from 55 participants in the study. Multiple methods were employed to estimate bolus volumes in the case of fluid intake, including regression and classification models. Among the tested models, neural networks-based regression achieved an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.88 and a root mean squared error of 0.2 (minimum bolus volume was 10 ml). Convolutional neural networks-based classification (when considering each bolus volume as a separate class) achieved an accuracy of over 99% using random cross-validation and around 66% using cross-subject validation. Multiple classification methods were also used for solid bolus type detection, including SVM and decision trees (DT), which achieved an accuracy above 99% with random validation and above 94% in cross-subject validation. Finally, regression models with both random and cross-subject validation were used for estimating the solid bolus volume with an R<sup>2</sup> value that approached 1 and root mean squared error values as low as 0.00037 (minimum solid bolus weight was 3 gm). These reported results lay the foundation for a cost-effective and non-invasive method for monitoring swallowing activities which can be extremely beneficial in managing various chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and obesity.",['Hassan EA; Khalifa Y; Morsy AA'],2024,monitoring of eating and drinking activities is critically important. swallowing is an essential process for maintaining life. swallowing is an essential process for maintaining life.

Molecular interactions between a diphenyl scaffold and PED/PEA15: Implications for type II diabetes therapeutics targeting PED/PEA15 - Phospholipase D1 interaction.,"In a recent study, we have identified BPH03 as a promising scaffold for the development of compounds aimed at modulating the interaction between PED/PEA15 (Phosphoprotein Enriched in Diabetes/Phosphoprotein Enriched in Astrocytes 15) and PLD1 (phospholipase D1), with potential applications in type II diabetes therapy. PED/PEA15 is known to be overexpressed in certain forms of diabetes, where it binds to PLD1, thereby reducing insulin-stimulated glucose transport. The inhibition of this interaction reestablishes basal glucose transport, indicating PED as a potential target of ligands capable to recover glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In this study, we employ computational methods to provide a detailed description of BPH03 interaction with PED, evidencing the presence of a hidden druggable pocket within its PLD1 binding surface. We also elucidate the conformational changes that occur during PED interaction with BPH03.

Long-term risk of overweight in offspring of Chinese women with gestational diabetes defined by IADPSG's but not by WHO's criteria.,"To examine long-term risk of overweight in offspring of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) defined by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG)'s criteria but not by the 1999 World Health Organization (WHO)'s criteria. We followed up 1681 mother-child pairs for 8 years in Tianjin, China. Overweight in children aged 1-5 and 6-8 were respectively defined as body mass index-for-age and -sex above the 2 z-score and 1 z-score curves of the WHO's child growth standards. Logistic regression was performed to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of hyperglycemia indices at oral glucose tolerance test and GDMs defined by different criteria for offspring overweight at different ages. Offspring of women with fasting plasma glucose ≥5.1 mmol/L were at increased risk of overweight at 6-8 years old (OR:1.45, 95% CI: 1.09-1.93). GDM defined by the IADPSG's criteria only was associated with increased risk of childhood overweight at 6-8 years old (1.65, 1.13-2.40), as compared with non-GDM by either of the two sets of criteria.

IMPRESS-Norway: improving public cancer care by implementing precision medicine in Norway; inclusion rates and preliminary results.,"In Norway, comprehensive molecular tumour profiling is implemented as part of the public healthcare system. A substantial number of tumours harbour potentially targetable molecular alterations. Therapy outcomes may improve if targeted treatments are matched with actionable genomic alterations. In the IMPRESS-Norway trial (NCT04817956), patients are treated with drugs outside the labelled indication based on their tumours molecular profile. IMPRESS-Norway is a national, prospective, non-randomised, precision cancer medicine trial, offering treatment to patients with advanced-stage disease, progressing on standard treatment. Comprehensive next-generation sequencing, TruSight Oncology 500, is used for screening. Patients with tumours harbouring molecular alterations with matched targeted therapies available in IMPRESS-Norway, are offered treatment. Currently, 24 drugs are available in the study. Primary study endpoints are percentage of patients offered treatment in the trial, and disease control rate (DCR) defined as complete or partial response or stable disease in evaluable patients at 16 weeks (W16) of treatment. Secondary endpoint presented is DCR in all treated patients. Between April 2021 and October 2023, 1,167 patients were screened, and an actionable mutation with matching drug was identified for 358 patients. By the data cut off 186 patients have initiated treatment, 170 had a minimum follow-up time of 16 weeks, and 145 also had evaluable disease. In patients with evaluable disease, the DCR was 40% (58/145). Secondary endpoint analysis of DCR in all treated patients, showed DCR of 34% (58/170).

Antitumor effects of co-treatment of resveratrol with antitumor drugs in ER- and HER2-positive breast cancer cells are due to induction of apoptosis and modulation of estrogen receptor expression.,"Resveratrol, a natural compound, may be an alternative to improving conventional breast cancer therapy. Thus, we assessed the capability of resveratrol at a low dose to enhance the in vitro effect of conventional theray in estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer cells. Cell viability of breast cancer cells was measured with neutral red uptake assay. Apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle progression and cell proliferation were detected through hypotonic fluorescent solution assay, formation of acidic vesicular organelles, flow cytometry, and bromodeoxyuridine assay, respectively. Western blotting was performed to study the expression of pro-apoptotic, anti-apoptotic and autophagic proteins, and estrogen receptors. Resveratrol combined with tamoxifen metabolites or trastuzumab reduced cell viability of ER- and HER2-positive breast cancer cells, respectively. This effect was mainly associated with induction of apoptosis due to a greater formation of hypodiploid nuclei, reduced protein expression of procaspase-7, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and PARP; and increased expression of cleaved PARP. Resveratrol decreased the expression of ERα and increased that of ERβ, contributing to the reduced viability on breast cancer cells. Combined treatments induced autophagy, evidenced by increased levels of acidic vesicular organelles and degradation of p62/SQSTM1 protein. Nevertheless, on inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine, cell viability was further reduced and apoptosis was induced, suggesting a pro-survival role of autophagy, impairing apoptosis. Resveratrol increasead the in vitro cytotoxic effect of conventional therapy in breast cancer cells. However, it was necessary to block resveratrol-induced autophagy to improve the therapeutic response.",['Franceschi BT; Bezerra PHA; Torqueti MR'],2024,resveratrol reduced the expression of ER and increased that of ER. resveratrol reduced the expression of ER and increased that of ER. resveratrol reduced the expression of ER and increased that of ER.
The association between dietary vitamin B1 intake and constipation: a population-based study.,"Numerous researches have indicated a correlation between the intake of dietary micronutrients and the occurrence of constipation. Nevertheless, the correlation between constipation and vitamin B1 remains uninvestigated. The main aim of this research was to examine the association between chronic constipation and the consumption of vitamin B1 in the diet among adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This study used data from the NHANES, a survey on health and nutrition conducted between 2005 and 2010. The respondents' dietary information was gathered by utilizing the 24-hour dietary records. Various statistical analyses, such as multiple logistic regression, subgroup analysis, and curve-fitting analysis, were employed to investigate the correlation between dietary intake of vitamin B1 and chronic constipation. In the trial, there were 10,371 participants, out of which 1,123 individuals (10.8%) were identified as having chronic constipation. Fully adjusted multiple logistic regression analyses showed that increasing dietary intake of vitamin B1 (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.99) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of constipation. Following adjustment for multiple variables in Model 3, the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the third tertile, in comparison to the first tertile (reference group), was 0.80 (0.65, 0.99). In addition, subgroup analyses and interaction tests showed a significant inverse association between vitamin B1 intake and the prevalence of constipation, especially among men, non-hypertensive, and non-diabetic individuals (all P-values less than 0.05). This research uncovered an inverse correlation between the consumption of vitamin B1 in the diet and the occurrence of chronic constipation. One potential explanation for this phenomenon is that the consumption of vitamin B1 in one's diet is linked to the softening of stools and an augmented occurrence of colonic peristalsis. Additional extensive prospective research is required to thoroughly examine the significance of thiamine in long-term constipation.",['Du W; Lu L; Liu Y; Yan Y; La R; Wu Q; Xu J; Zhou X'],2024,study used data from the national health and nutrition examination survey. dietary information was gathered by utilizing 24-hour dietary records. dietary data was gathered by utilizing 24-hour dietary records.

Dietary Intakes of Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Pregnancy Outcomes: A Prospective Observational Study.,"Nutrient intake for pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is important to ensure satisfactory birth outcomes. This study aims to explore the dietary profiles of patients with GDM, compare the results with the Chinese dietary guidelines or Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) from China and investigate the relationship between maternal dietary intake and pregnancy outcomes. A total of 221 patients with GDM in the second trimester were included in the cohort. Dietary intake data were collected using a 24-hour recall method for three consecutive days. The pregnancy outcomes of these participants were subsequently monitored. Both univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations between dietary intake variables or general characteristics variables and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Participants with adverse pregnancy outcomes showed a lower intake of iodine and vitamin D, a lower percentage of dietary energy intake from carbohydrates and a higher percentage of dietary energy intake from fats, compared to participants without adverse pregnancy outcomes. The gestational weight gain and family history of diabetes were associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conversely, regular exercise, the intake of iodine and Vitamin D, and the percentage of dietary energy intake from carbohydrates were associated with a decreased risk. The daily diet of pregnant women with GDM in China did not meet the dietary guidelines or DRIs. The low intake of Vitamin D and iodine, the low dietary carbohydrate ratio, family history of diabetes, lack of exercise, and high gestational weight gain were associated with increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with GDM.",['Zheng X; Zhang Q; Su W; Liu W; Huang C; Shi X; Li X'],2024,study aims to explore the dietary profiles of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus. a total of 221 patients with GDM in the second trimester were included in the cohort.
Opportunistic pathogen <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> targets the LC3B-ceramide complex and mediates lethal mitophagy resistance in oral tumors.,"Mechanisms by which <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) infection enhances oral tumor growth or resistance to cell death remain elusive. Here, we determined that <i>P. gingivalis</i> infection mediates therapeutic resistance via inhibiting lethal mitophagy in cancer cells and tumors. Mechanistically, <i>P. gingivalis</i> targets the LC3B-ceramide complex by associating with LC3B via bacterial major fimbriae (FimA) protein, preventing ceramide-dependent mitophagy in response to various therapeutic agents. Moreover, ceramide-mediated mitophagy is induced by Annexin A2 (ANXA2)-ceramide association involving the E142 residue of ANXA2. Inhibition of ANXA2-ceramide-LC3B complex formation by wild-type <i>P. gingivalis</i> prevented ceramide-dependent mitophagy. Moreover, a FimA-deletion mutant <i>P. gingivalis</i> variant had no inhibitory effects on ceramide-dependent mitophagy. Further, 16S rRNA sequencing of oral tumors indicated that <i>P. gingivalis</i> infection altered the microbiome of the tumor macroenvironment in response to ceramide analog treatment in mice. Thus, these data provide a mechanism describing the pro-survival roles of <i>P. gingivalis</i> in oral tumors.",['Sheridan M; Chowdhury N; Wellslager B; Oleinik N; Kassir MF; Lee HG; Engevik M; Peterson Y; Pandruvada S; Szulc ZM; Yilmaz Ö; Ogretmen B'],2024,i>P. gingivalis/i> infection mediates therapeutic resistance via inhibiting lethal mitophagy in cancer cells and tumors. a wild-type i>P. gingivalis/i> variant had no inhibitory effects on ceramide-dependent mitophagy.
Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy-Based Detection of EMT-Related Targets in Endometrial Cancer: Potential for Diagnosis and Prognostic Prediction.,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is one of the important mechanisms of malignancy in endometrial cancer, and detection of EMT targets is a key challenge to explore the mechanism of endometrial carcinoma (EC) malignancy and discover novel therapeutic targets. This study attempts to use surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a highly sensitive, ultrafast, and highly specific analytical technology, to rapidly detect microRNA-200a-3p and ZEB1 in endometrial cancer cell lines. The silver nanoparticles were decorated with iodine and calcium ions, can capture the SERS fingerprints of microRNA-200a-3p and ZEB1 protein, and effectively avoid the interference of impurity signals. At the same time, the method has high sensitivity for the detection of the above EMT targets, and the lowest detection limits for microRNA-200a-3p and ZEB1 are 4.5 pmol/mL and 10 ng/mL, respectively. At the lowest detection concentration, the method still has high stability. In addition, principal component analysis can not only identify microRNA-200a-3p and ZEB1 protein from a variety of EMT-associated microRNA and proteins but also identify them in the total RNA and total protein of endometrial cancer cell lines and normal endometrial epithelial cell lines. This study modified silver nanoparticles with iodine and calcium ions and for the first time captured the fingerprints of EMT-related targets microRNA-200a-3p and ZEB1 at the same time without label, and the method has high sensitivity and stability. This SERS-based method has immense potential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of EMT-related EC, as well as identifying biomarkers for malignant degree and prognosis prediction.",['Ma Y; Ma R; Zhang Z; Jiang H; Li Y; Jiang S; Li Y'],2024,epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) is one of the important mechanisms of endometrial cancer. detection of EMT targets is a key challenge to explore the mechanism of endometrial carcinoma (EC) malignancy. silver nanoparticles were decorated with iodine and calcium ions.
"Discovery of metastases in thyroid cancer and ""benign metastasizing goiter"": a historical note.","At the beginning of the eighteenth century, most physicians recognized cancer as an aggressive process that gradually spreads, leading to cachexia and death. Thyroid malignancies had long been underestimated because the majority of the population of West Europe suffered from diffuse goiters that masked malignant processes in the neck. Moreover, the life expectancy at that time was very low (about 37-40 years), so the majority of people died of other causes before metastatic thyroid cancer could develop and manifest. Nevertheless, in 1817, French dermatologist Jean Louis Alibert described the first case of a malignant tumor involving the thyroid gland. From the 1820s the number of case reports describing thyroid cancer increased. Even though Jean Claude Recamier described <i>metastases</i> in 1829, secondary lesions on various organs in patients with thyroid malignancies were not themselves considered malignant until 1876.",['Kushchayev S; Kushchayeva Y; Glushko T; Pestun I; Teytelboym O'],2024,"cancer was a process that gradually spreads, leading to cachexia and death. the majority of people died of other causes before metastatic thyroid cancer could develop and manifest."
"3,3'-((3,4,5-trifluoropHenyl)methylene)bis(4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) inhibit lung cancer cell proliferation and migration.","Lung cancer is a major public health challenge and, despite therapeutic improvements, is the first leading cause of cancer worldwide. The current cure rate from advanced cancer treatment is excessively low. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify novel, potent and less toxic anticancer agents for the treatment of lung cancer. The aim of our research is to synthesize a new biscoumarin 3,3'-((3,4,5-trifluorop -phenyl)methylene)bis(4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) (C35) as an anticancer agent. C35 was simply prepared by 4-hydroxycoumarin and 3,4,5-trifluorobenzaldehyde under ethanol and its structure was analyzed by spectroscopic analyses. The anti-proliferation effect of C35 was detected using CCK-8 assay. Migration abilities were measured by Transwell assay. The expression of correlated proteins was determined by Western blot. The results showed that C35 displayed strong cytostatic effects on lung cancer cell proliferation. In addition, C35 possessed a significant inhibition of migration by reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, C35 treatment suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 in lung cancer cells. Moreover, in vivo experiments were carried out, in which we treated Lewis tumor-bearing C57 mice via intraperitoneal injection of C35. Results showed that C35 inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In conclusion, our study demonstrated the anticancer activity of C35 via suppression of lung cancer cell proliferation and migration, which is possibly involved with the inhibition of the p38 pathway.",['Luo W; Chang G; Lin D; Xie H; Sun H; Li Z; Mo S; Wang R; Wang Y; Zheng Z'],2024,"the current cure rate from advanced cancer treatment is excessively low. it is of great importance to identify novel, potent and less toxic anticancer agents for the treatment of lung cancer."
Utilizing Artificial Intelligence Among Patients With Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Diabetes mellitus, a condition characterized by dysregulation of blood glucose levels, poses significant health challenges globally. This meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in managing diabetes, underpinned by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review scrutinized articles published between January 2019 and February 2024, sourced from six electronic databases: Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and MEDLINE, using keywords such as ""Artificial intelligence use in medicine, Diabetes management, Health technology, Machine learning, Diabetic patients, AI applications, and Health informatics."" The analysis revealed a notable variance in the prevalence of diabetes symptoms between patients managed with AI models and those receiving standard treatments or other machine learning models, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.88-1.08, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Sub-group analyses, focusing on symptom detection and management, consistently showed outcomes favoring AI interventions, with RRs of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.87-1.08, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) for symptom detection and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.56-1.57, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) for management, respectively.

The efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients: A scoping review.,"Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are used for the treatment of diabetes and for their cardiovascular and kidney benefits in patients with or without diabetes. Use in solid organ transplant recipients is controversial because transplant recipients were excluded from the major clinical trials assessing SGLT2 inhibitors. The goal of this review was to assess the available literature regarding the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients. A PubMed search was conducted for studies published in English through December 31, 2023. Studies were excluded if they were meta-analyses, review articles, commentaries, single case reports, or in vitro studies, or did not involve the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients with a diabetic, cardiovascular, or kidney outcome being assessed. In the final review, 20 studies were included: kidney (n = 15), heart (n = 4), and liver/lung/kidney (n = 1) transplant recipients. SGLT2 inhibitors had similar A1c reduction efficacy and were found to be weight neutral with possible weight reduction effects. Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes were not adequately assessed in the available studies. Adverse effects were reported to occur at a similar rate in transplant recipients compared to the general population. SGLT2 inhibitors were initiated ≥1-year post-transplant in most transplant recipients included in these studies.

Current insights into transcriptional role(s) for the nutraceutical <i>Withania somnifera</i> in inflammation and aging.,"The health-beneficial effects of nutraceuticals in various diseases have received enhanced attention in recent years. Aging is a continuous process wherein physiological activity of an individual declines over time and is characterized by various indefinite hallmarks which contribute toward aging-related comorbidities in an individual which include many neurodegenerative diseases, cardiac problems, diabetes, bone-degeneration, and cancer. Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process that has an important function in driving aging. Currently, a growing body of evidence substantiates the connection between epigenetic modifications and the aging process, along with aging-related diseases. These modifications are now being recognized as promising targets for emerging therapeutic interventions. Considering that almost all the biological processes are modulated by RNAs, numerous RNA-binding proteins have been found to be linked to aging and age-related complexities. Currently, studies have shed light on the ability of the nutraceutical <i>Withania somnifera</i> (Ashwagandha) to influence RNA expression, stability, and processing, offering insights into its mechanisms of action. By targeting RNA-related pathways, <i>Withania somnifera</i> may exhibit promising effects in ameliorating age-associated molecular changes, which include modifications in gene expression and signaling networks. This review summarizes the potential role of <i>Withania somnifera</i> as a nutraceutical in modulating RNA-level changes associated with aging, encompassing both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies. Taken together, the putative role(s) of <i>Withania</i> in modulation of key RNAs will provide insights into understanding the aging process and facilitate the development of various preventive and therapeutic strategies employing nutraceuticals for healthy aging.",['Saha P; Ajgaonkar S; Maniar D; Sahare S; Mehta D; Nair S'],2024,"nutraceutical i>Withania somnifera/i> (Ashwagandha) can influence RNA expression, stability, and processing.

Implementation research: a protocol for two three-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trials on continuous glucose monitoring devices in people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa and Kenya.,"Self-monitoring of glucose is an essential component of type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has provided an alternative to daily fingerstick testing for the optimisation of insulin dosing and general glucose management in people with T1D. While studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of CGM on clinical outcomes in the US, Europe and Australia, there are limited data available for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and further empirical evidence is needed to inform policy decision around their use in these countries. This trial was designed as a pragmatic, parallel-group, open-label, multicentre, three-arm, randomised (1:1:1) controlled trial of continuous or periodic CGM device use versus standard of care in people with T1D in South Africa and Kenya. The primary objective of this trial will be to assess the impact of continuous or periodic CGM device use on glycaemic control as measured by change from baseline glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Additional assessments will include clinical outcomes (glucose variation, time in/below/above range), safety (adverse events, hospitalisations), quality of life (EQ-5D, T1D distress score, Glucose Monitoring Satisfaction Survey for T1D), and health economic measures (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, quality adjusted life years). This trial aims to address the substantial evidence gap on the impact of CGM device use on clinical outcomes in LMICs, specifically South Africa and Kenya.

FRET Sensor-Modified Synthetic Hydrogels for Real-Time Monitoring of Cell-Derived Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging.,"Matrix remodeling plays central roles in a range of physiological and pathological processes and is driven predominantly by the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Our understanding of how MMPs regulate cell and tissue dynamics is often incomplete as <i>in vivo</i> approaches are lacking and many <i>in vitro</i> strategies cannot provide high-resolution, quantitative measures of enzyme activity <i>in situ</i> within tissue-like 3D microenvironments. Here, we incorporate a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor of MMP activity into fully synthetic hydrogels that mimic many properties of the native ECM. We then use fluorescence lifetime imaging to provide a real-time, fluorophore concentration-independent quantification of MMP activity, establishing a highly accurate, readily adaptable platform for studying MMP dynamics <i>in situ</i>. MCF7 human breast cancer cells encapsulated within hydrogels highlight the detection of MMP activity both locally, at the sub-micron level, and within the bulk hydrogel.

The role of exercise in aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia.,"Aromatase inhibitors are prescribed in breast cancer due to their associated lower rate of cancer recurrence compared to tamoxifen. However, aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIIA) is one of the leading causes of treatment nonadherence, increasing the risk of cancer recurrence. The pathophysiology of AIIA is poorly understood, and although current recommendations for AIIA include lifestyle changes and analgesics depending on the severity of symptoms, there is no established effective treatment. The aim of this study is to explore the presentation and mechanism of AIIA and investigate the feasibility and efficacy of different exercise interventions (aerobic, resistance, aerobic and resistance combined, and yoga or tai chi) in patients with AIIA to guide the development of formal exercise prescription guidelines. Findings indicate that a mixed-modality regimen of aerobic and resistance exercises is feasible and safe and may serve the most benefit in improving joint pain, functionality, and quality of life. More specifically, the weekly regimen should consist of 150 min of aerobic exercise with two sessions of at least six resistance exercises, 8 to 12 repetitions, three sets each. Supplementary yoga and tai chi may be recommended twice a week depending on a patient's target symptoms. Yoga was associated with improved physical functionality, whereas tai chi was related to improvements in mental health. However, the feasibility and impact of combined aerobic and resistance exercise protocols with yoga or tai chi in our target population were not investigated in this review.

Deletion of Nrf2 induced severe oxidative stress and apoptosis in mice model of diabetic bladder dysfunction.,"The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway has been confirmed as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), however few studies revealed its effect in diabetic bladder dysfunction (DBD). Herein, we reported a Nrf2 deletion diabetic mouse model induced by 8-week high-fat diet feeding combined with streptozocin (STZ) injection in Nrf2 knockout mice. Besides, wild-type mice (WT) were used as control group, wild-type mice with high-fat diet feeding and STZ injection as diabetic group (WT-T2DM), and Nrf2 knockout mice as Nrf2 deletion group (KO). The pathophysiological indexes and bladder morphology showed typical pathological features of diabetic bladder dysfunction in Nrf2 knockout diabetic mouse mice (KO-T2DM). ELISA results showed that advanced glycation end products (AGEs), ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in bladder was were up-regulated in both WT-T2DM and KO-T2DM group, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in these two groups. Compared with WT-T2DM group, western blot analysis of the bladder showed down-regulated expression of NQO1 and HO-1 in KO-T2DM group. However, apoptosis, marked by Caspase3 and bax/bcl-2 ratio, was increased in KO-T2DM group. Neurotrophic factor (NGF) was significantly decreased in DBD model, and even much lower in KO-T2DM group.

Outcomes of interest included hospital readmissions, emergency department visits and all-cause mortality measured over a 30-year time horizon. Baseline event frequencies were derived from published real-world data studies; sotagliflozin's efficacy was estimated from SOLOIST-WHF. Health benefits were calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs included pharmaceutical costs, rehospitalization, emergency room visits and adverse events. Economic value was measured using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). <b>Results:</b> Sotagliflozin use decreased annualized rehospitalization rates by 34.5% (0.228 vs 0.348, difference: -0.120), annualized emergency department visits by 40.0% (0.091 vs 0.153, difference: -0.061) and annualized mortality by 18.0% (0.298 vs 0.363, difference: -0.065) relative to standard of care, resulting in a net gain in QAYs of 0.425 for sotagliflozin versus standard of care. Incremental costs using sotagliflozin increased by $19,374 over a 30-year time horizon of the patient, driven largely by increased pharmaceutical cost. Estimated ICER for sotagliflozin relative to standard of care was $45,596 per QALY. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sotagliflozin is a cost-effective addition to standard of care for patients hospitalized with heart failure and comorbid diabetes.",['Kim J; Wang S; Sikirica S; Shafrin J'],2024,"cost-effectiveness model was created for patients hospitalized for heart failure. outcomes included hospital readmissions, emergency department visits and all-cause mortality measured over a 30-year time horizon."
Inhibition and kinetic studies of phytochemical constituents of <i>Goniothalamus wynaadensis</i> and their isoxazoline derivatives on α-glucosidase.,"α-Glucosidase, an enzyme involved in post-prandial hyperglycaemia, was used as a target to study the effect of compound(s) isolated from <i>Goniothalamus wynaadensis</i> and its isoxazoline derivatives.

The Enterococcus secretome inhibits the growth of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis V853 with their antiproliferative properties and nanoencapsulation effects.,"In our study, the secretome of the clinical isolate Enterococcus faecalis HY7 displayed antibacterial activity against the vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis V853. These bacteriocin-like substances showed thermal stability at a wide range of temperatures up to 121 °C, while proteinase K treatment resulted in a total loss of their activity. PCR-based screening for bacteriocin biosynthetic genes revealed that Enterococcus faecalis HY7 harbored multiple enterocin-producing genes, including ent A, avc A, and as-48. The production kinetics demonstrated the highest levels of bacteriocins production at 16 h, whereas the activity was diminished after 32 h of microbial growth. Notably, the partially purified bacteriocins exhibited anti-proliferative activity on the colon cancer cells, Caco2, with an IC50 value of 172.8 μg/mL.

Single-cell profiling reveals the metastasis-associated immune signature of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The metastasis-associated immune signature in HCC is worth exploring. Bioinformatic analysis was conducted based on the single-cell transcriptome data derived from HCC patients in different stages. Cellular composition, pseudotime state transition, and cell-cell interaction were further analyzed and verified. Generally, HCC with metastasis exhibited suppressive immune microenvironment, while HCC without metastasis exhibited active immune microenvironment. Concretely, effector regulatory T cells (eTregs) were found to be enriched in HCC with metastasis. PHLDA1 was identified as one of exhaustion-specific genes and verified to be associated with worse prognosis in HCC patients. Moreover, A novel cluster of CCR7<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) was identified with high expression of maturation and migration marker genes. Pseudotime analysis showed that inhibition of differentiation occurred in CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs rather than cDC1 in HCC with metastasis. Furthermore, interaction analysis showed that the reduction of CCR7<sup>+</sup> DCs lead to impaired CCR7/CCL19 interaction in HCC with metastasis. HCC with metastasis exhibited upregulation of exhaustion-specific genes of eTregs and inhibition of CCL signal of a novel DC cluster, which added new dimensions to the immune landscape and provided new immune therapeutic targets in advanced HCC.",['Zhong D; Shi Y; Ma W; Liang Y; Liu H; Qin Y; Zhang L; Yang Q; Huang X; Lu Y; Shang J'],2024,"metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) bioinformatic analysis was conducted based on single-cell transcriptome data. cellular composition, pseudotime state transition, and cell-cell interaction were further analyzed and verified."
Discrete placental gene expression signatures accompany diabetic disease classifications during pregnancy.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects up to 10% of pregnancies and is classified into subtypes GDMA1 (managed by lifestyle modifications) and GDMA2 (requiring medication). However, whether these subtypes are distinct clinical entities or more reflective of an extended spectrum of normal pregnancy endocrine physiology remains unclear. Integrated bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and spatial transcriptomics harbors the potential to reveal disease gene signatures in subsets of cells and tissue microenvironments. We aimed to combine these high-resolution technologies with rigorous classification of diabetes subtypes in pregnancy. We hypothesized that differences between pre-existing Type 2 and gestational diabetes subtypes would be associated with altered gene expression profiles in specific placental cell populations. In a large case-cohort design, we compared validated cases of GDMA1, GDMA2, and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to healthy controls by bulk RNA-seq (n=54). Quantitative analyses with RT-qPCR of presumptive genes of significant interest were undertaken in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort of similarly well-characterized cases and controls (n=122). Additional integrated analyses of term placental single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data enabled us to determine the cellular subpopulations and niches that aligned with the GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM gene expression signatures at higher resolution and with greater confidence. Dimensional reduction of the bulk RNA-seq data revealed that the most common source of placental gene expression variation was the diabetic disease subtype. Relative to controls, we found 2,052 unique and significantly differentially expressed genes (-2<Log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change)>2 thresholds; q<0.05 Wald Test) among GDMA1 placental specimens, 267 among GDMA2, and 1,520 among T2DM. Several candidate marker genes (CSH1, PER1, PIK3CB, FOXO1, EGFR, IL2RB, SOD3, DOCK5, and SOGA1) were validated in an independent and non-overlapping validation cohort (q<0.05 Tukey). Functional enrichment revealed the pathways and genes most impacted for each diabetes subtype, and the degree of proximal similarity to other subclassifications. Surprisingly, GDMA1 and T2DM placental signatures were more alike by virtue of increased expression of chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation genes, while albumin was the top marker for GDMA2 with increased expression of placental genes in the wound healing pathway. Assessment of these gene signatures in single-cell, single-nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data revealed high specificity and variability by placental cell and microarchitecture types. For example, at the cellular and spatial (e.g., microarchitectural) levels, distinguishing features were observed in extravillous trophoblasts (GDMA1) and macrophages (GDMA2). Lastly, we utilized these data to train and evaluate four machine learning models to estimate our confidence in predicting the control or diabetes status of placental transcriptome specimens with no available clinical metadata. Consistent with the distinct association of perinatal outcome risk, placentae from GDMA1, GDMA2, and T2DM-affected pregnancies harbor unique gene signatures that can be further distinguished by altered placental cellular subtypes and microarchitectural niches.",['Barrozo ER; Racusin DA; Jochum MD; Garcia BT; Suter MA; Delbeccaro M; Shope C; Antony K; Aagaard KM'],2024,"gestational diabetes mellitus affects up to 10% of pregnancies. it is classified into subtypes GDMA1 and GDMA2 (requiring medication). integrating bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics harbors the potential to reveal disease gene signatures in subsets of cells and tissue microenvironments."
Evaluation of postoperative fluctuations in plasma sodium concentration and triphasic response after pediatric craniopharyngioma resection: A French cohort study.,"Disturbances in plasma sodium levels are a major complication following recent resections of craniopharyngiomas in children. They must be properly managed to avoid neurological sequelae. We aimed to describe the variations and characteristics of postoperative natremia in children who had undergone a first craniopharyngioma resection with a particular focus on the frequency of triphasic syndrome in these patients. Paediatric patients with craniopharyngiomas who underwent a first surgical resection in the neurosurgery department of the Hôpital Femme Mère Enfant (Lyon, France) between January 2010 and September 2021 were included in the present study and the medical records were analysed retrospectively. A total of 26 patients were included. Of these, 17 (65.4%) had a postoperative course characterised by the occurrence of both initial diabetes insipidus (DI) and hyponatremia a few days later. Eight patients (30.8%) presented then with isolated and persistent DI. Patients with the triphasic syndrome had a significantly higher grade of Puget classification on MRI (1 and 2), compared to the other patients. Dysnatremia is common after craniopharyngioma resections in children. This immediate postoperative complication is particularly difficult to manage and requires rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of medical treatment to minimize fluctuations in sodium levels and avoid neurological sequelae.",['Bazus L; Perge K; Cabet S; Mottolese C; Villanueva C'],2024,dysnatremia is common after craniopharyngioma resections in children. it is difficult to manage and requires rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of medical treatment.
Multimodal Treatment of Resectable Esophageal Cancer.,"The current guidelines for the treatment of esophageal cancer recommend a multimodal approach that includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Despite advances in treatment, rates of treatment failure, pathologic incomplete response, tumor metastasis, and death remain unacceptably high. We performed a narrative literature review using the terms ""resectable esophageal cancer"" and ""multimodal therapy"" to identify prospective trials of neoadjuvant radiation and chemotherapy, individually or combined with surgery, for esophageal cancer. Trials performed between 1984 and 2022 were identified and analyzed. gov was queried to identify ongoing studies. Twenty-one clinical studies were identified: 15 randomized controlled trials and 6 prospective nonrandomized trials. The results of the randomized trials suggest that multimodal therapy-in the form of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus radiation or chemotherapy alone, followed by surgery-is associated with better rates of local disease control and partial clinical response and, potentially, longer survival than with surgery alone. Immunotherapy is an emerging option for the treatment of patients with esophageal cancer. The treatment of patients with resectable esophageal cancer is rapidly evolving. Although previous treatment options have had only limited benefits for patients, significant progress has been made during last 3 decades. The results of the available studies suggest that advances in the treatment of esophageal cancer have the potential to improve survival in these patients; however, questions remain regarding mechanisms of action, patient selection, and the use of personalized approaches based on genetics.",['Waters J; Sewell M; Molena D'],2024,"current guidelines for the treatment of esophageal cancer recommend multimodal approach. rates of treatment failure, pathologic incomplete response, tumor metastasis, and death remain unacceptably high. trials performed between 1984 and 2022 were identified and analyzed."

Materials and Methods The OPTIMAM Mammography Imaging Database contains screening data, including mammograms and information on interval cancers, for > 300,000 women who attended screening at three different sites in the UK from 2012 onward. Cancer-free screening examinations from women aged 50-70 years were obtained and classified as risk-positive or risk-negative based on the occurrence of cancer within 3 years of the original examination. Examinations with confirmed cancer and images containing implants were excluded. From the resulting 5264 risk-positive and 191488 risk-negative examinations, training (<i>n</i> = 89285) validation (<i>n</i> = 2106) and test (<i>n</i> = 39351) datasets were produced for model development and evaluation. The AI model was trained to predict future cancer occurrence based on screening mammograms and patient age. Performance was evaluated on the test dataset using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared across subpopulations to assess potential biases. Interpretability of the model was explored, including with saliency maps. Results On the hold-out test set, the AI model achieved an overall AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.72). There was no evidence of a difference in performance across the three sites, between patient ethnicities or across age-groups Visualization of saliency maps and sample images provided insights into the mammographic features associated with AI-predicted cancer risk.

Risk Factors for Pediatric Critical COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Risk stratification is a cornerstone of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society COVID-19 treatment guidance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the clinical characteristics and comorbidities associated with critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Two independent reviewers screened the literature (Medline and EMBASE) for studies published through August 31, 2023, that reported outcome data on patients aged ≤21 years with COVID-19. Critical disease was defined as an invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, or death. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and heterogeneity was explored through subgroup analyses. Among 10,178 articles, 136 studies met the inclusion criteria for review. Data from 70 studies, which collectively examined 172,165 children and adolescents with COVID-19, were pooled for meta-analysis. In previously healthy children, the absolute risk of critical disease from COVID-19 was 4% (95% CI, 1%-10%). Compared with no comorbidities, the pooled OR for critical disease was 3.95 (95% CI, 2.78-5.63) for the presence of one comorbidity and 9.51 (95% CI, 5.62-16.06) for ≥2 comorbidities. Key risk factors included cardiovascular and neurological disorders, chronic pulmonary conditions (excluding asthma), diabetes, obesity, and immunocompromise, all with statistically significant ORs >2.00. While the absolute risk for critical COVID-19 in children and adolescents without underlying health conditions is relatively low, the presence of one or more comorbidities was associated with markedly increased risk. These findings support the importance of risk stratification in tailoring pediatric COVID-19 management.",['Aparicio C; Willis ZI; Nakamura MM; Wolf J; Little C; Maron GM; Sue PK; Anosike BI; Miller C; Bio LL; Singh P; James SH; Oliveira CR'],2024,"two independent reviewers screened literature for studies published through 2023. critical disease defined as an invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, intensive care unit admission, or death. random effects models were used to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)"

Higher habitual intakes of flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods are associated with a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes in the UK Biobank cohort.,"To examine the associations of a diet high in flavonoid-rich foods, as reflected by a ""Flavodiet Score"" (FDS), the major individual food contributors to flavonoid intake, and flavonoid subclasses with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in the UK Biobank cohort. Flavonoid intakes were estimated from ≥2 dietary assessments among 113,097 study participants [age at enrolment: 56 ± 8 years; 57% female] using the U.S Department of Agriculture (USDA) databases. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate associations between dietary exposures and T2D. During 12 years of follow-up, 2628 incident cases of T2D were identified. A higher FDS (compared to lower [Q4 vs. Q1]), characterised by an average of 6 servings of flavonoid-rich foods per day, was associated with a 26% lower T2D risk [HR: 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66-0.84), p<sub>trend</sub> = <0.001]. Mediation analyses showed that lower body fatness and basal inflammation, as well as better kidney and liver function partially explain this association. In food-based analyses, higher intakes of black or green tea, berries, and apples were significantly associated with 21%, 15%, and 12% lower T2D risk. Among individual flavonoid subclasses, 19-28% lower risks of T2D were observed among those with the highest, compared to lowest intakes. A higher consumption of flavonoid-rich foods was associated with lower T2D risk, potentially mediated by benefits to obesity/sugar metabolism, inflammation, kidney and liver function. Achievable increases in intakes of specific flavonoid-rich foods have the potential to reduce T2D risk.",['Thompson AS; Jennings A; Bondonno NP; Tresserra-Rimbau A; Parmenter BH; Hill C; Perez-Cornago A; Kühn T; Cassidy A'],2024,"flavonoid intakes were estimated from 2 dietary assessments among 113,097 study participants. a higher FDS was associated with a 26% lower T2D risk. a higher FDS was associated with a 26% lower risk of T2D."
The Primary Mechanisms of Drug-Food Homologous Traditional Chinese Medicine Polysaccharides in the Prevention and Treatment of Diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease associated with hyperglycemia caused by insufficient insulin secretion or insulin resistance. Early symptoms are related to an abnormal increase in water intake, food intake, and urination. In Chinese medicine, diabetes mellitus is categorized as a ""thirst-quenching"" condition. Currently, the clinical treatment of diabetes mellitus relies mainly on Western medications, which often target the symptoms rather than alter the cause of the disease, and can cause certain side effects and drug resistance. In comparison, the polysaccharides of Chinese medicines from the same source of food and medicine have become an emerging choice for the prevention and treatment of diabetes due to their wide sources, high safety, and low side effects. To reveal the mechanisms of the polysaccharides of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus, the CiteSpace visualization software was used to conduct extensive literature searches through Chinese and international databases, such as PubMed, Medline, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Through literature volume analysis, keyword co-occurrence, cluster analysis, and trend highlighting, we found that the main mechanisms of TCM polysaccharides in the prevention and treatment of diabetes include regulating intestinal flora, improving insulin resistance, alleviating oxidative stress, adjusting lipid metabolism imbalance, and inhibiting inflammatory responses. Furthermore, this study systematically summarizes the mechanism of ""using sugar to reduce sugar"" to provide innovative ideas for the development of health products for the treatment of diabetes using the polysaccharides of Chinese medicinal herbs.",['Wang M; Li Y; Yang S; Wei P'],2024,"diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease associated with hyperglycemia. early symptoms are related to an abnormal increase in water intake, food intake, and urination. polysaccharides of traditional Chinese medicine have become an emerging choice for diabetes treatment."
Renewable Electroconductive Hydrogels for Accelerated Diabetic Wound Healing and Motion Monitoring.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a prevalent complication of diabetes mellitus, may result in an amputation. Natural and renewable hydrogels are desirable materials for DFU dressings due to their outstanding biosafety and degradability. However, most hydrogels are usually only used for wound repair and cannot be employed to monitor motion because of their inherent poor mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. Given that proper wound stretching is beneficial for wound healing, the development of natural hydrogel patches integrated with wound repair properties and motion monitoring was expected to achieve efficient and accurate wound healing. Here, we designed a dual-network (chitosan and sodium alginate) hydrogel embedded with lignin-Ag and quercetin-melanin nanoparticles to achieve efficient wound healing and motion monitoring. The double network formed by the covalent bond and electrostatic interaction confers the hydrogel with superior mechanical properties. Instead of the usual chemical reagents, genipin extracted from <i>Gardenia</i> was used as a cross-linking agent for the hydrogel and consequently improved its biosafety. Furthermore, the incorporation of lignin-Ag nanoparticles greatly enhanced the mechanical strength, antibacterial efficacy, and conductivity of the hydrogel. The electrical conductivity of hydrogels gives them the capability of motion monitoring. The motion sensing mechanism is that stretching of the hydrogel induced by motion changes the conductivity of the hydrogel, thus converting the motion into an electrical signal. Meanwhile, quercetin-melanin nanoparticles confer exceptional adhesion, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties to the hydrogels. The system ultimately achieved excellent wound repair and motion monitoring performance and was expected to be used for stretch-assisted safe and accurate wound repair in the future.",['Hu XQ; Zhu JZ; Hao Z; Tang L; Sun J; Sun WR; Hu J; Wang PY; Basmadji NP; Pedraz JL; Vairo C; Lafuente EG; Ramalingam M; Xie S; Wang R'],2024,hydrogels are desirable materials for DFU dressings due to their outstanding biosafety and degradability. but most hydrogels are usually only used for wound repair and cannot be employed to monitor motion because of their inherent poor mechanical properties.
"Risk factors of adult isoniazid-resistant and rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis in Nanjing, 2019-2021.","This study aimed to analyze the risk factors associated with isoniazid-resistant and rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis (Hr-TB) in adults. The clinical data of 1,844 adult inpatients diagnosed with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Nanjing Second Hospital from January 2019 and December 2021 were collected. All culture positive strain from the patient specimens underwent drug susceptibility testing (DST). Among them, 166 patients with Hr-TB were categorized as the Hr-TB group, while the remaining 1,678 patients were classified as having drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB). Hierarchical logistic regression was employed for multivariate analysis to identify variables associated with Hr-TB. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR 1.472, 95% CI 1.037-2.088, p = 0.030) and a history of previous tuberculosis treatment (OR 2.913, 95% CI 1.971-4.306, p = 0.000) were at higher risk of developing adult Hr-TB, with this risk being more pronounced in male patients. Within the cohort, 1,640 patients were newly treated, and among them, DM (OR 1.662, 95% CI 1.123-2.461, p = 0.011) was identified as risk factors for Hr-TB.

[Stereotactic radiation therapy for liver tumours].,"Liver lesions are common in oncology, and various focal treatments can be used, such as surgery, chemoembolization, radiofrequency, and systemic treatment. However, these treatments are often not feasible for a number of reasons, including the patient's general health or the characteristics of the lesion itself. Additionally, localized relapses may occur after focal treatments. In the past, liver radiotherapy was limited by the toxicities it caused and was mainly used in palliative situations or specific pre-transplant management. However, advancements in high-precision radiotherapy, like hypofractionated radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions, have allowed to treat the lesions with minimal margins, delivering higher doses while reducing the healthy liver's exposure.

"Air pollution, life's essential 8, and risk of severe non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among individuals with type 2 diabetes.","The impacts of long-term exposure to air pollution on the risk of subsequent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is ambiguous. The modifying role of Life's Essential 8 (LE8) remains unknown. This study included 23,129 participants with T2D at baseline from the UK Biobank. Annual means of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>X</sub>), and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>) were estimated using the land-use regression model for each participant. The associations between exposure to air pollution and the risk of severe NAFLD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. The effect modification of LE8 was assessed through stratified analyses. During a median 13.6 years of follow-up, a total of 1,123 severe NAFLD cases occurred. After fully adjusting for potential covariates, higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95%CI:1.02, 1.23 per interquartile range [IQR] increment), NO<sub>2</sub> (HR = 1.15, 95%CI:1.04, 1.27), and NO<sub>X</sub> (HR = 1.08, 95%CI:1.01, 1.17) were associated with an elevated risk of severe NAFLD. In addition, LE8 score was negatively associated with the risk of NAFLD (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.97, 0.98 per point increment). Compared with those who had low air pollution and high LE8, participants with a high air pollution exposure and low LE8 had a significantly higher risk of severe NAFLD. Our findings suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution was associated with an elevated risk of severe NAFLD among participants with T2D.

A novel subtype based on driver methylation-transcription in lung adenocarcinoma.,"To identify driver methylation genes and a novel subtype of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) by multi-omics and elucidate its molecular features and clinical significance. We collected LUAD patients from public databases, and identified driver methylation genes (DMGs) by MethSig and MethylMix algrothms. And novel driver methylation multi-omics subtypes were identified by similarity network fusion (SNF). Furthermore, the prognosis, tumor microenvironment (TME), molecular features and therapy efficiency among subtypes were comprehensively evaluated. 147 overlapped driver methylation were identified and validated. By integrating the mRNA expression and methylation of DMGs using SNF, four distinct patterns, termed as S1-S4, were characterized by differences in prognosis, biological features, and TME. The S2 subtype showed unfavorable prognosis. By comparing the characteristics of the DMGs subtypes with the traditional subtypes, S3 was concentrated in proximal-inflammatory (PI) subtype, and S4 was consisted of terminal respiratory unit (TRU) subtype and PI subtype. By analyzing TME and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) features, increased immune infiltration and higher expression of immune checkpoint genes were found in S3 and S4. While S4 showed higher EMT score and expression of EMT associated genes, indicating S4 may not be as immunosensitive as the S3. Additionally, S3 had lower TIDE and higher IPS score, indicating its increased sensitivity to immunotherapy.

Association Between Cardiovascular Health and Retinopathy in US Adults: From NHANES 2005-2008.,"Investigating the relationship between cardiovascular health (CVH) and retinopathy in the adult population of the United States. The cross-sectional study Methods: The study utilized samples, including the diabetes population, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2005 and 2008 (N= 4,249), to assess cardiovascular health (CVH) using the Life's Essential 8 (LE8) assessment. Retinopathy are determined through imaging assessment by professionals independently grading fundus photographs. Univariable and multivariable weighted logistic regression models, restricted cubic splines (RCS), Subgroup analysis and weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression approaches were employed to assess the association between LE8 score-based CVH status and retinopathy. The mediation analysis was conducted to investigate whether serum albumin levels mediated the relationship between LE8 score and retinopathy. In a fully adjusted logistic regression model, participants in the moderate and high CVH groups had a 39% (odds ratio (OR) 0.61, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.43-0.87, P- value = 0.01) and 56% (OR 0.44, 95%CI 0.25-0.77, P- value < 0.001) lower odds of developing retinopathy compared to the low CVH group. The RCS model indicates a significant non-linear relationship between CVH and retinopathy. The WQS regression analysis suggests that blood glucose (47.65%) and blood pressure (19.41%) have the highest weights in relation to retinopathy. Mediation analysis suggests that serum albumin partially mediates the relationship between LE8 scores and retinopathy. This study demonstrates a significant negative correlation between overall cardiovascular health measured by LE8 scores and retinopathy. Public health strategies that promote achieving optimal cardiovascular health indicators may help reduce the burden of retinal microvascular diseases.",['Liu X; Chang Y; Li Y; Liu Y; Chen N; Cui J'],2024,study used samples from the national health and nutrition examination survey. retinopathy are determined through imaging assessment by professionals independently grading fundus photographs.
Approximately 50% of acute intestinal failure (AIF) patients on short-term parenteral nutrition (PN) have intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) without effect on hospital length of stay and mortality.,"Patients with intestinal failure (IF) are often dependent on PN for provision of calories and nutrients for survival. Similar to chronic intestinal failure (CIF) patients, those who have AIF are also at risk of IFALD, which is a poorly understood but potentially fatal condition. The local incidence of IFALD amongst AIF patients is not known. The primary objective of this study was to determine the incidence of IFALD in AIF patients on short-term PN. Secondary objectives were to analyse patient and PN risk factors of IFALD, and clinical outcomes of length of stay (LOS) and inpatient mortality. This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study of hospitalised adult patients with AIF prescribed with short-term PN. All adult patients aged 21 years and above who received PN for at least 5 consecutive days and had normal liver function tests (LFTs) at the time of PN initiation were included in this study. A total of 171 patients were enrolled in this study, with 77 (45%) having deranged LFTs at the end of PN therapy and categorised under the IFLAD group. The patient cohort was predominantly male (92 [54%]) and had a median age of 68 years (IQR 59-76). Patients with IFALD at the end of PN therapy had higher diabetes prevalence (36% vs 26%, p = 0.2) and were on PN for a longer duration (median [IQR]: 12 [8-17] vs 8 [6-15] days, p = 0.003) than those without IFALD. There were no significant differences in patient and PN characteristics between the IFLAD and non-IFALD group. The multivariable models showed that the IFALD cohort had longer hospital stays (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65-1.23) and lower odds of inpatient death (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.12-4.60), though both findings are not statistically significant (p = 0.5, 0.7). In this study, IFALD is a common phenomenon in AIF and the incidence was found to be an estimated 50% amongst patients on short-term PN with similar clinical outcomes between the two groups.",['Cheang LY; Chong NCJ; Poh BY; Tan LB; Goh JLR; Lee MS; Tan KCT; Kadir HA; Cheah CCM; Salazar E'],2024,patients with IFALD are often dependent on PN for provision of calories and nutrients for survival. the local incidence of IFALD amongst AIF patients is not known.
"The integrated stress response in pancreatic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer.","Present in all eukaryotic cells, the integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly coordinated signaling network that controls cellular behavior, metabolism and survival in response to diverse stresses. The ISR is initiated when any one of four stress sensing kinases (PERK, GCN2, PKR, HRI) becomes activated to phosphorylate the protein translation initiation factor eIF2α, shifting gene expression toward a comprehensive rewiring of cellular machinery to promote adaptation. While the ISR has been shown to play an important role in the homeostasis of multiple tissues, evidence suggests that it is particularly crucial for the development and ongoing health of the pancreas. Among the most synthetically dynamic tissues in the body, the exocrine and endocrine pancreas relies heavily on the ISR to rapidly adjust cell function to meet the metabolic demands of the organism. The hardwiring of the ISR into normal pancreatic functions and adaptation to stress may explain why it is a commonly utilized pro-oncogenic and therapy-resistance mechanism in both pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs). Here we review what is known about the key roles that the ISR plays in the development, homeostasis, and neoplasia of the pancreas.",['Malnassy G; Ziolkowski L; Macleod KF; Oakes SA'],2024,"integrated stress response (ISR) is a highly coordinated signaling network that controls cellular behavior, metabolism and survival in response to diverse stresses. the ISR is initiated when any one of four stress sensing kinases becomes activated to phosphorylate the protein translation initiation factor eIF2. evidence suggests that it is particularly crucial for the development and ongoing health of the pancreas."
Prediction model of early recurrence of multimodal hepatocellular carcinoma with tensor fusion.,"Clinical decision-making in oncology involves multimodal data, encompassing histopathological, radiological, and clinical factors. Several computer-aided multimodal decision-making systems have emerged in recent years to predict the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy, but they tend to employ simplistic feature-level concatenation, resulting in redundancy and hampering overall performance. More notably, these models often lack an effective integration with clinical relevance. Particularly, they still face major challenges of integrating data from diverse scales and dimensions, and introducing a liver background, which are clinically significant but previously overlooked aspects.&#xD;&#xD; In addressing these challenges, we provide new insight in two areas. Firstly, we introduce the tensor fusion method into the model, which demonstrates unique advantages in handling the fusion of multi-scale and multi-dimensional data, thus potentially enhancing the model's performance. Secondly, to our best knowledge, it's a precedent to take the impact of the liver background into account. We innovatively incorporate the impact of the liver background into the feature extraction process by using a deep learning segmentation-based algorithm. This inclusion makes the model closer to real-world clinical scenarios, as the liver background may contain vital information related to postoperative recurrence.&#xD; &#xD; We collected radiomics (MRI) and histopathological images of 176 cases diagnosed by experienced clinicians from two independent centers. Our proposed network went through training and 5-fold cross-validation on the dataset of 176 cases and was subsequently validated on an independent external dataset of 40 cases. Finally, our proposed network exhibited excellent performance in predicting the postoperative early recurrence of HCC with an AUC of 0.883. These results suggest significant progress in addressing the challenges related to multimodal data fusion which provides potential value for more accurate predictions of clinical outcomes.",['Wang T; Chen H; Chen Z; Li M; Lu Y'],2024,multimodal decision-making systems have emerged in recent years. they tend to employ simplistic feature-level concatenation. these models often lack an effective integration with clinical relevance.
White light computer-aided optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps in routine clinical practice.,"<b>Background and study aims</b> Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could make the optical diagnosis (OD) of diminutive colorectal polyps (DCPs) more reliable and objective. This study was aimed at prospectively evaluating feasibility and diagnostic performance of AI-standalone and AI-assisted OD of DCPs in a real-life setting by using a white light-based system (GI Genius, Medtronic Co, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States). <b>Patients and methods</b> Consecutive colonoscopy outpatients with at least one DCP were evaluated by 11 endoscopists (5 experts and 6 non-experts in OD). DCPs were classified in real time by AI (AI-standalone OD) and by the endoscopist with the assistance of AI (AI-assisted OD), with histopathology as the reference standard. <b>Results</b> Of the 480 DCPs, AI provided the outcome ""adenoma"" or ""non-adenoma"" in 81.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.5-84.6). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy of AI-standalone OD were 97.0% (95% CI 94.0-98.6), 38.1% (95% CI 28.9-48.1), 80.1% (95% CI 75.2-84.2), 83.3% (95% CI 69.2-92.0), and 80.5% (95% CI 68.7-82.8%), respectively. Compared with AI-standalone, the specificity of AI-assisted OD was significantly higher (58.9%, 95% CI 49.7-67.5) and a trend toward an increase was observed for other diagnostic performance measures. Overall accuracy and negative predictive value of AI-assisted OD for experts and non-experts were 85.8% (95% CI 80.0-90.4) vs. 80.1% (95% CI 73.6-85.6) and 89.1% (95% CI 75.6-95.9) vs. 80.0% (95% CI 63.9-90.4), respectively. <b>Conclusions</b> Standalone AI is able to provide an OD of adenoma/non-adenoma in more than 80% of DCPs, with a high sensitivity but low specificity.

Obesity in Prediabetic Patients: Management of Metabolic Complications and Strategies for Prevention of Overt Diabetes.,"Obesity and prediabetes affect a substantial part of the general population, but are largely underdiagnosed, underestimated, and undertreated. Prediabetes differs from diabetes only in the degree of hyperglycaemia consequent to the progressive decline in residual beta-cell function. Both prediabetes and diabetes occur as a consequence of insulin resistance that starts several years before the clinical onset of overt diabetes. Macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes are mainly caused by insulin resistance. This is why in prediabetes, the overall cardiovascular risk is, by all means, similar to that in patients with diabetes. It is important, therefore, to identify prediabetes and treat patients not only to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes, but to reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with prediabetes. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of prediabetes in patients with obesity and the progression toward overt diabetes. We have reviewed nutritional and pharmacological approaches to the management of obesity and reduced glucose tolerance, and the treatment of the major comorbidities in these patients, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and Metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), has also been reviewed. In patients with obesity and prediabetes, the nutritional approach is similar to that adopted for patients with obesity and diabetes; treatments of dyslipidaemia and hypertension also have the same targets compared to patients with diabetes. MASLD is a critical issue in these patients; in the prediabetic state, MASLD rarely progresses into fibrosis. This highlights the importance of the early recognition of this pathological condition before patients become diabetic when the risk of fibrosis is much higher. It is necessary to raise awareness of the clinical relevance of this pathological condition in order to prompt early intervention before complications occur. The single most important therapeutic goal is weight loss, which must be early and persistent.",['Chianelli M; Armellini M; Carpentieri M; Coccaro C; Cuttica CM; Fusco A; Marucci S; Nelva A; Nizzoli M; Ponziani MC; Sciaraffia M; Tassone F; Busetto L'],2024,"prediabetes and diabetes occur as a consequence of insulin resistance. this is mainly caused by insulin resistance. in prediabetes, the overall cardiovascular risk is, by all means, similar to that in patients with diabetes."
Risk of increased mortality in underweight survivors: A brief report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.,"Approximately 1 in 10 adult survivors of childhood cancer is underweight. Although the consequences of being overweight or obese have been well described, outcomes among childhood cancer survivors who are underweight are unknown. To determine whether underweight status increases the risk of mortality. Cohort study: Marginal models with generalized estimating equations to evaluate the associations between body mass index (BMI), serious or life-threatening chronic conditions, and death in the setting of long-term follow-up questionnaires and National Death Index search. C. Underweight status, defined as body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared with ideal body weight. Based on available literature on body weight and mortality from the general population, ideal body weight was defined as BMI 22.0-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality. Of 9454 survivors (median age 35 years old (range, 17-58), an average of 17.5 years from diagnosis), 627 (6.6%) participants were underweight at baseline or follow-up questionnaire. Of 184 deaths, 29 were among underweight survivors. Underweight status was more common among females (9.1% vs. 4.5%, p < .01) and participants with younger age at diagnosis (8.2% for < 5 years vs. 6.1% for ≥5 years, p < .01), lower household income (8.9% for < $20,000 vs. 6.0% for ≥ $20,000, p < .01), or a history of serious chronic condition (p = .05). After adjustment for these factors, in addition to prior smoking and a history of radiation therapy, the risk of all-cause mortality within two years of BMI report was increased (OR 2.85; 95% CI: 1.63-4.97; p < .01) for underweight survivors, compared with ideal-weight survivors. Childhood cancer survivors who are underweight are at increased risk for late mortality that appears unrelated to smoking status, recognized chronic disease, or subsequent malignancy. Whether targeted nutritional interventions would ameliorate this risk is unknown.",['Tonorezos ES; Chou JF; Moskowitz CS; Leisenring WM; Friedman DN; Sklar CA; Dilley KJ; Hudson MM; Mertens A; Armstrong GT; Robison LL; Meacham LR; Oeffinger KC'],2024,a third of adult survivors of childhood cancer are underweight. underweight status is more common among females. underweight status is more common among females.
Evaluation of systemic medications associated with diabetic retinopathy: a nested case-control study from the UK Biobank.,"This study aims to investigate the associations between commonly used systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Individuals with linked primary care prescription data from the UK Biobank were included. Cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. Controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using conditional univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 3377 case subjects with DR were included in the study and matched with 3377 control subjects. In multivariable logistic regression, increased odds of incident DR were observed for exposure to short-acting insulins (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.22 to 2.18), medium-acting insulins (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.75), sulfonylureas (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.46). Instead, the use of fibrates (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94) and Cox-2 inhibitors (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.58 to 0.79) was associated with decreased odds of incident DR. Dose-response relationships were observed for all five drug categories (all p<0.05). This study comprehensively investigated the associations between systemic medication use and DR and found significant associations between the use of short-acting insulins, medium-acting insulins and sulfonylureas with increased odds of incident DR. In contrast, fibrates and Cox-2 inhibitors were associated with decreased odds of incident DR. These findings may provide valuable insights into DM medication management and serve as a reference for the prevention of DR in patients with DM.",['Jin G; Ma Y; Zheng D; Jin L; Young CA; Shen Y; Tan Y; Jin J; Zhang X; Wu Y; Liu Z'],2024,"study aims to investigate the associations between systemic medications and diabetic retinopathy (DR) cases were defined as individuals with a Hospital Episode Statistics-coded or primary care recorded diagnosis of DR or self-reported DR. controls were matched for age, sex, glycosylated haemoglobin, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension status and cardiovascular disease status."
"Protective effects of nodosin against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute kidney injury through regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and ferroptosis in rats.","This research aimed to explore the impact of nodosin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in rats. The study involved administering nodosin orally at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg body weight orally to rats for 7 days before induction of AKI. Toward the end of the study, urine, blood, and kidneys were gathered from the rats to undergo biochemical and molecular examination after sacrificing them. Serum Scr, BUN, urine NGAL, and KIM-1 levels were significantly decreased in nodosin-treated AKI rats. Besides, nodosin administration resulted in a significant reduction in kidney MDA and 4-HNE levels. In contrast, antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, GPx, and GST levels increased, as well as Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1 levels increased, while Keap-1 mRNA levels decreased in AKI rats. In addition, AKI rats treated with nodosin reversed excessive ferroptosis in the kidneys of LPS-induced AKI rats, as evidenced by increased mRNA and protein levels of GPX4, SLC7A11, and FTH-1. The administration of nodosin significantly reduced levels of inflammatory markers including TLR4, MYD88, NF-κB p65, IkKβ, and IL-1β, while IL-10 levels increased in the AKI-induced rats. Besides, histopathological changes were reduced in AKI-induced rats treated with nodosin.

The treatment of AKI could greatly benefit from this option.",['Su C; Liu Z; Liu L; Xiong Z; Xu T; Zhang S; Chen Y; Jiang Y'],2024,nodosin administration significantly reduced kidney MDA and 4-HNE levels. nodosin administration significantly reduced levels of inflammatory markers.
Development of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring Service by Clinical Pharmacists in a Medically Underserved Population.,"<i>Background:</i> Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is an evolving technology that provides a wealth of information to aid in managing diabetes. Professional CGM (ProCGM) is recommended when personal CGM is not desired or available. Patients in medically underserved areas may have limited access to personal CGM devices, thus ProCGM devices can be used for short-term monitoring and medication adjustment. Clinical pharmacists are well-positioned to help set up and establish personal and professional CGM management services. <i>Objectives:</i> To determine the effect of ProCGM in patients with persistently uncontrolled type 2 diabetes in a medically underserved population (MUP). <i>Methods:</i> Pre-post intervention analysis of a single cohort of patients in a public health center. Patients with persistently uncontrolled (A1c > 9%) and taking at least one daily dose of insulin were included. Included participants wore a ProCGM sensor and met with the clinical pharmacist at least once for ProCGM data interpretation and education. The primary analysis evaluated patients who achieved an A1c <9% 1-6 months after intervention. The change in A1c was also evaluated. Participants completed a pre- and post-survey about their experience. <i>Results:</i> Twenty-two patients were included in the final analysis. Ten patients achieved an A1c <9% (45%). The mean A1c pre- and post-ProCGM was 11.0% and 9.8% respectively, with a decrease of -1.2% (p=0.055) overall and a decrease of -1.7% for patients who wore the sensor for at least 10 days (p=0.012; n=15). Using the CGM data 91% of participants had a change to their medication regimen and 45% achieved an A1c <9%. Six participants experienced hypoglycemia per the CGM report, but only two were aware of it. After reviewing their glucose report with the pharmacist, 95% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed to feeling more knowledgeable about blood sugar patterns after reviewing the report with a pharmacist. <i>Conclusion:</i> Almost half of the patients in the study achieved an A1c <9%. This study demonstrated glycemic benefit in patients in a MUP who wore a ProCGM for at least 10 days and met with a clinical pharmacist. Data from ProCGM enabled patients to better understand glucose patterns in those with persistently uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.",['Lingow S; Kinnikin K; Guyton J'],2024,ProCGM is recommended when personal CGM is not desired or available. patients in medically underserved areas may have limited access to personal CGM devices. clinical pharmacists are well-positioned to help set up and establish personal and professional CGM management services.
"Improving access to cancer clinical research in Brazil: recent advances and new opportunities. Expert opinions from the 4th CURA meeting, São Paulo, 2023.","Clinical research is the cornerstone of improvements in cancer care. However, it has been conducted predominantly in high-income countries with few clinical trials available in Brazil and other low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). Of note, less than one-third of registered clinical trials addressing some of the most commonly diagnosed cancers (breast, lung and cervical) recruited patients from LMIC in the last years. The Institute Project CURA promoted the fourth CURA meeting, discussing barriers to cancer clinical research and proposing potential solutions. A meeting was held in São Paulo, Brazil, in June 2023 with representatives from different sectors: Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), National Commission of Ethics in Research (CONEP), non-governmental organisations, such as the Latin American Cooperative Oncology Group, the Brazilian Society of Clinical Oncology (SBOC), Contract Research Organisations, pharmaceutical companies and investigators. A total of 16 experts pointed out achievements as shortening the time of regulatory processes involving Anvisa and CONEP, development of staff training programs, maintenance of the National Program of Oncological Attention (PRONON), and the foundation of qualified centres in North and Northeast Brazilian regions. Participants also highlighted the need to be more competitive in the field, which requires optimising ongoing policies and implementing new strategies as decentralisation of clinical research centres, public awareness campaigns, community-centered approaches, collaborations and partnerships, expansion of physicians-directed policies, exploring the role of the steering committee. Active and consistent reporting of the initiatives might help to propagate ongoing advances, increasing Brazilian participation in clinical cancer research.

Surfaceome: a new era in the discovery of immune evasion mechanisms of circulating tumor cells.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that detach from the original site and reach the bloodstream. The most aggressive CTCs survive various immune system attacks and initiate metastasis formation. Importantly, CTCs are not specifically targeted by the current immunotherapies due to the limited knowledge on specific targets. Proteomic profiling can be a powerful tool for understanding some of the immune evasion mechanisms used by cancer cells and particularly CTCs. These mechanisms are generally linked to the expression of specific surface proteins/peptides (i.e. the surfaceome). The study of the peptides that bind to class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) and of the various glycoproteins expressed on CTC surface may open a completely new avenue for the discovery of novel mechanisms of immune evasion. In this review, we discuss how immunopeptidomic and glycoproteomic studies of CTCs that interact with immune cells could help to better understand how metastasis-initiator CTCs escape the host immune response. We also describe how immunopeptidomic and glycoproteomic studies are carried out.",['Masmoudi D; Vialaret J; Hirtz C; Alix-Panabières C'],2024,the most aggressive CTCs survive various immune system attacks. the most aggressive CTCs survive various immune system attacks. the most aggressive CTCs survive various immune system attacks.
"Real-World Data on the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Management of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Asia-Pacific: The INSIGHT Study.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. While there has been rapid evolution in the treatment paradigm of HCC across the past decade, the extent to which these newly approved therapies are utilized in clinical practice in the real world is, however, unknown. The INSIGHT study was an investigator-initiated, multi-site longitudinal cohort study conducted to reflect real-world epidemiology and clinical practice in Asia-Pacific in the immediate 7-year period after the conclusion of the BRIDGE study. Data were collected both retrospectively (planned 30% of the total cohort size) and prospectively (planned 70%) from January 2013 to December 2019 from eligible patients newly diagnosed with HCC from 33 participating sites across 9 Asia-Pacific countries. A total of 2,533 newly diagnosed HCC patients (1,052 in retrospective cohort and 1,481 in prospective cohort) were enrolled. The most common risk factor was hepatitis B in all countries except Japan, Australia, and New Zealand, where the prevalence of hepatitis C and diabetes were more common. The top three comorbidities reported in the INSIGHT study include cirrhosis, hypertension, and diabetes. We observe high heterogeneity in the first-line treatment recorded across countries and across disease stages, which significantly affects survival outcomes. Stratification by factors such as etiologies, tumor characteristics, the presence of extrahepatic metastases or macrovascular invasion, and the use of subsequent lines of treatment were performed. The INSIGHT study describes a wide spectrum of clinical management practices in HCC, where patient demographics, differential costs, and patient access to therapies may lead to wide geographical variations through the patient's treatment cycle, from diagnosis to clinical outcome. The high heterogeneity in patient outcomes demonstrates the need for more robust and clinical management strategies to be designed and adopted to bring about better patient outcomes.",['Sim YK; Chong MC; Gandhi M; Pokharkar YM; Zhu Y; Shi L; Lequn L; Chen CH; Kudo M; Lee JH; Strasser SI; Chanwat R; Chow PKH'],2024,INSIGHT study was an investigator-initiated longitudinal cohort study. data were collected retrospectively and prospectively from January 2013 to December 2019. most common risk factor was hepatitis B in all countries except Japan.
Drug repositioning in thyroid cancer: from point mutations to gene fusions.,"The diagnosis of thyroid cancer (TC) has increased dramatically in recent years. Papillary TC is the most frequent type and has shown a good prognosis. Conventional treatments for TC are surgery, hormonal therapy, radioactive iodine, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. However, resistance to treatments is well documented in almost 20% of all cases. Genomic sequencing has provided valuable information to help identify variants that hinder the success of chemotherapy as well as to determine which of those represent potentially druggable targets. There is a plethora of targeted therapies for cancer, most of them directed toward point mutations; however, chromosomal rearrangements that generate fusion genes are becoming relevant in cancer but have been less explored in TC. Therefore, it is relevant to identify new potential inhibitors for genes that are recurrent in the formation of gene fusions. In this review, we focus on describing potentially druggable variants and propose both point variants and fusion genes as targets for drug repositioning in TC.",['Sánchez-Marín D; Silva-Cázares MB; González-Del Carmen M; Campos-Parra AD'],2024,"the diagnosis of thyroid cancer has increased dramatically in recent years. the most frequent type of TC is surgery, hormonal therapy, radioactive iodine, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. resistance to treatments is well documented in almost 20% of all cases."
Urotensin II system in chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and long-term condition marked by a gradual decline in kidney function. CKD is prevalent among those with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. Affecting over 10% of the global population, CKD stands as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite substantial advances in understanding CKD pathophysiology and management, there is still a need to explore novel mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Urotensin II (UII), a potent vasoactive peptide, has garnered attention for its possible role in the development and progression of CKD. The UII system consists of endogenous ligands UII and UII-related peptide (URP) and their receptor, UT. URP pathophysiology is understudied, but alterations in tissue expression levels of UII and UT and blood or urinary UII concentrations have been linked to cardiovascular and kidney dysfunctions, including systemic hypertension, chronic heart failure, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes. UII gene polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of diabetes. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of UT mitigated kidney and cardiovascular disease in rodents, making the UII system a potential target for slowing CKD progression. However, a deeper understanding of the UII system's cellular mechanisms in renal and extrarenal organs is essential for comprehending its role in CKD pathophysiology. This review explores the evolving connections between the UII system and CKD, addressing potential mechanisms, therapeutic implications, controversies, and unexplored concepts.",['Michael OS; Kanthakumar P; Soni H; Rajesh Lenin R; Abhiram Jha K; Gangaraju R; Adebiyi A'],2024,chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and long-term condition. chronic kidney disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

Robust inference for causal mediation analysis of recurrent event data.,"Recurrent events, including cardiovascular events, are commonly observed in biomedical studies. Understanding the effects of various treatments on recurrent events and investigating the underlying mediation mechanisms by which treatments may reduce the frequency of recurrent events are crucial tasks for researchers. Although causal inference methods for recurrent event data have been proposed, they cannot be used to assess mediation. This study proposed a novel methodology of causal mediation analysis that accommodates recurrent outcomes of interest in a given individual. A formal definition of causal estimands (direct and indirect effects) within a counterfactual framework is given, and empirical expressions for these effects are identified.

CAR T-Cell Immunotherapy in Minority Patients with Lymphoma.,"Administration of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CART19) immunotherapy for large B-cell lymphomas (LBCLs), a subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), involves high costs and access to specialized tertiary care centers. We investigated whether minority health populations (MHPs) have equal access to CART19 and whether their outcomes are similar to those of non-MHPs. We analyzed the prevalence and clinical outcomes of patients treated with commercial CART19 at two geographically and socioeconomically different institutions: the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and the Knight Cancer Institute (KCI, Portland, Oregon). In the ACC catchment area, 8956 patients were diagnosed with NHL between 2015 and 2019 (latest available data from the state registry), including 17.9% MHPs. In the ACC, between 2018 and 2022 (CART became available in 2018), 1492 patients with LBCL were treated, and 194 received CART19. The proportion of MHPs was 15.7% for the entire LBCL cohort but only 6.7% for the CART19 cohort. During the same time, in the KCI catchment area, 4568 patients were diagnosed with NHL, including 4.2% MHPs. In the KCI, 396 patients with LBCL were treated, and 47 received CART19. The proportion of MHPs was 6.6% for the entire LBCL cohort and 4.2% for the CART19 cohort. The 3-month response, survival, and toxicities after CART19 infusion showed similar results, although the number of patients who were treated was limited. This study shows that the access of MHPs to tertiary centers for LBCL care was preserved but appeared reduced for commercial CART19 immunotherapy. Although clinical outcomes of MHPs seemed similar to those of non-MHPs, the small sample size precludes drawing firm conclusions. Further studies are needed.

Kidney Transplant Outcomes From Deceased Donors Who Received Dialysis.,"Recipient outcomes after kidney transplant from deceased donors who received dialysis prior to kidney donation are not well described. To compare outcomes of transplant recipients who received kidneys from deceased donors who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation vs recipients of kidneys from deceased donors who did not undergo dialysis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted including data from 58 US organ procurement organizations on deceased kidney donors and kidney transplant recipients. From 2010 to 2018, 805 donors who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation were identified. The donors who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation were matched 1:1 with donors who did not undergo dialysis using a rank-based distance matrix algorithm; 1944 kidney transplant recipients were evaluated. Kidney transplants from deceased donors who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation compared with kidney transplants from deceased donors who did not undergo dialysis. The 4 study outcomes were delayed graft function (defined as receipt of dialysis by the kidney recipient ≤1 week after transplant), all-cause graft failure, death-censored graft failure, and death. From 2010 to 2018, 1.4% of deceased kidney donors (805 of 58 155) underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation. Of these 805 individuals, 523 (65%) donated at least 1 kidney. A total of 969 kidneys (60%) were transplanted and 641 kidneys (40%) were discarded. Among the donors with kidneys transplanted, 514 (mean age, 33 years [SD, 10.8 years]; 98 had hypertension [19.1%] and 36 had diabetes [7%]) underwent dialysis prior to donation and were matched with 514 (mean age, 33 years [SD, 10.9 years]; 98 had hypertension [19.1%] and 36 had diabetes [7%]) who did not undergo dialysis. Kidney transplants from donors who received dialysis prior to donation (n = 954 kidney recipients) were associated with a higher risk of delayed graft function compared with kidney transplants from donors who did not receive dialysis (n = 990 kidney recipients) (59.2% vs 24.6%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio, 4.17 [95% CI, 3.28-5.29]). The incidence rates did not significantly differ at a median follow-up of 34.1 months for all-cause graft failure (43.1 kidney transplants per 1000 person-years from donors who received dialysis prior to donation vs 46.9 kidney transplants per 1000 person-years from donors who did not receive dialysis; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.70-1.15]), for death-censored graft failure (22.5 vs 20.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively; adjusted HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.83-1.69]), or for death (24.6 vs 30.8 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.55-1.04]). Compared with receiving a kidney from a deceased donor who did not undergo dialysis, receiving a kidney from a deceased donor who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation was associated with a significantly higher incidence of delayed graft function, but no significant difference in graft failure or death at follow-up.",['Wen Y; Mansour SG; Srialluri N; Hu D; Thiessen Philbrook H; Hall IE; Doshi MD; Mohan S; Reese PP; Parikh CR'],2024,"kidney transplant recipients who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation were matched 1:1 with donors who did not undergo dialysis. from 2010 to 2018, 805 donors who underwent dialysis prior to kidney donation were identified."
Extracellular Matrix-Mimetic Intrinsic Versatile Coating Derived from Marine Adhesive Protein Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing through Regulating the Microenvironment.,"The management of diabetic wound healing remains a severe clinical challenge due to the complicated wound microenvironments, including abnormal immune regulation, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), and repeated bacterial infections. Herein, we report an extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimetic coating derived from scallop byssal protein (Sbp9<sup>Δ</sup>), which can be assembled <i>in situ</i> within 30 min under the trigger of Ca<sup>2+</sup> driven by strong coordination interaction. The biocompatible Sbp9<sup>Δ</sup> coating and genetically programmable LL37-fused coating exhibit outstanding antioxidant, antibacterial, and immune regulatory properties <i>in vitro</i>. Proof-of-concept applications demonstrate that the coating can reliably promote wound healing in animal models, including diabetic mice and rabbits, <i>ex vivo</i> human skins, and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>-infected diabetic mice. In-depth mechanism investigation indicates that improved wound microenvironments accelerated wound repair, including alleviated bacterial infection, lessened inflammation, appearance of abundant M2-type macrophages, removal of ROS, promoted angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization. Collectively, our investigation provides an <i>in situ</i>, convenient, and effective approach for diabetic wound repair.",['Wang L; Xue B; Zhang X; Gao Y; Xu P; Dong B; Zhang L; Zhang L; Li L; Liu W'],2024,the coating can be assembled i>in situ/i> within 30 min. it can be assembled under the trigger of Casup>2+/sup>. the biocompatible coating can reliably promote wound healing in animal models.
[Progress of circulating tumor DNA methylation for gastric cancer screening and management].,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is cell-free DNA released by tumors or circulating tumor cells, containing abundant tumor-specific information that can serve as biomarkers for cancer early screening, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response. This is particularly attractive in the field of gastric cancer, where high-quality screening, monitoring, and prediction methods are currently lacking. Gastric cancer exhibits significant tumor heterogeneity, with large differences in genetic and epigenetic characteristics among different subgroups. Methylated ctDNA has high sensitivity and specificity, which can help clarify tumor genotyping and facilitate the formulation of precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, numerous studies have confirmed the unique advantages of methylated DNA in predicting treatment response, adjuvant therapy, and drug resistance assessment, which may be used in the future to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens and improve patient chemotherapeutic response, and even treat multidrug resistance. However, there are several challenges associated with methylated ctDNA, such as low sensitivity and specificity at single-target sites, limited association between some gastric cancer subtypes and ctDNA, off-target risks, and the lack of large-scale and high-quality clinical research evidence. This review mainly summarizes current research on the methylation status of ctDNA in gastric cancer and connects these findings to early screening, recurrence monitoring, and potential treatment opportunities for gastric cancer. With advances in technology and the deepening of interdisciplinary research, ctDNA detection will reveal more disease information and become an essential foundation for gastric cancer research and precision medicine treatment.",['Cao QX; Yan L; Hou NY; Chen JF; Yu S; Lu HJ; Dan ZJ; Pang MH'],2024,"methylated ctDNA is a cell-free DNA released by tumors or circulating tumor cells. this is particularly attractive in the field of gastric cancer. high-quality screening, monitoring, and prediction methods are currently lacking."
"Role of serum endotoxin, FGF19, TLR2, TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-10 in NAFLD-associated T2DM pathogenesis: Insights into Th1 bias and protective mechanisms.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in non-obese patients is pathophysiologically distinct, exhibiting common immunological link with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aims to delineate the role of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated immuno-modulation along with its association with fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and its ligand fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in the pathogenesis of NAFLD without or with T2DM. Blood samples were collected from patients with NAFLD (n = 90), NAFLD with T2DM (n = 90) and healthy cohorts (n = 90) with consent and clinical records. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELIZA) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were used to analyze messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), protein expression and gene polymorphism. The molecular genetic analysis revealed the prevalence of variant allele(A) in FGFR4 gene in both cases compared to controls. The mRNA expression of FGF19 and TLR2 exhibited significant upregulation in NAFLD without T2DM compared to NAFLD with T2DM. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) showed upregulation in both disease cohorts compared to control while IL-10 showed significant downregulation in NAFLD with T2DM compared to the other two cohorts. Correlation analysis between FGF19 and TLR2 revealed significant positive association in both NAFLD with and without T2DM. The Th1:Th2 ratio showed significant upregulation in NAFLD with T2DM compared to NAFLD without T2DM. In conclusion, elevated serum endotoxin levels appear to contribute to NAFLD and T2DM development. Upregulated FGF19 seems to be protective against developing T2DM in NAFLD patients. Higher TLR2, TNF-α and IL-12 expression in NAFLD without T2DM suggests a Th1 bias in its pathogenesis, while reduced IL-10 in NAFLD with T2DM implies a more skewed Th1 state in this condition.",['Das SJ; Pathak B; Dutta S; Bose S; Bose PD'],2024,non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in non-obese patients is pathophysiologically distinct. exhibited common immunological link with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) study aims to delineate role of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-mediated immuno-modulation along with its association with fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) and its ligand fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in pathogenesis of NAFLD
Differential Effect of Consolidative Thoracic Radiation Therapy in Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer Based on Sex.,"The landmark randomized trial on chest irradiation in extensive disease small cell lung cancer (CREST) demonstrated that consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) improved overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after initial chemotherapy (chemo) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, with potentially increased benefit in women compared with men. It is unknown whether similar findings would apply after chemoimmunotherapy became the standard first-line treatment. In this analysis, we report national practice patterns and survival outcomes of cTRT according to patient sex. We included patients from de-identified electronic health record-derived database diagnosed with stage IV small cell lung cancer (2014-2021) who completed 4 to 6 cycles of first-line systemic therapy (platinum-doublet chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy). We evaluated OS and PFS using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with receipt of cTRT as an independent variable and stratified by sex. As a sensitivity analysis, we weighted the models by the inverse probability of receiving cTRT. A total of 1227 patients were included (850 chemotherapy, 377 chemoimmunotherapy). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients who did and did not receive cTRT. Among women, cTRT was associated with superior OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87) and PFS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82) compared with those not receiving cTRT. Conversely, no OS or PFS benefit with cTRT was observed in men (OS HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.80-1.31; PFS HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.85-1.47). Findings were similar in weighted analyses. The survival efficacy of cTRT may be moderated by sex, with female patients appearing more likely to benefit than male patients. These findings reflect sex-based survival trends with similar effect sizes to those observed in the CREST trial. Although the underpinnings of this association need to be elucidated, stratification by sex should be considered for randomized-controlled trials studying cTRT in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.",['Jairam V; Soulos PR; K C M; Gross CP; Slotman BJ; Chiang AC; Park HS'],2024,landmark randomized trial on chest irradiation in large-stage small cell lung cancer (CREST) demonstrated consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) improved overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after initial chemotherapy (chemo) in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. it is unknown whether similar findings would apply after chemoimmunotherapy became the standard first-line treatment.
[Diagnostics and treatment challenges and research progress in early-onset gastric cancer].,"The incidence of gastric cancer has decreased, while the occurrence of early-onset gastric cancer has increased. There is no consensus on the definition of early-onset gastric cancer currently. The characteristics of tumor staging and differentiation, coupled with the lack of targeted comprehensive treatment, present a significant clinical challenge in managing early-onset gastric cancer. Relevant studies have analyzed the genetic characteristics of early-onset gastric cancer and have preliminarily revealed its relationship with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and molecular subtypes. These findings have the potential to contribute to the prevention and personalized treatment of early-onset gastric cancer. In the future, larger-scale evidence-based data are needed to establish diagnostic criteria, elucidate the mechanisms, and develop targeted diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of early-onset gastric cancer.",['Li S; Zhang KC; Chen L'],2024,there is no consensus on the definition of early-onset gastric cancer. the characteristics of tumor staging and differentiation present a significant clinical challenge in managing early-onset gastric cancer.
Semaglutide in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction: Exploring Recent Evidence in Therapeutic Potential for the Obese Population.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent condition, particularly among the aging population in the United States, and is associated with significant challenges due to its complex pathophysiology and limited therapeutic options. Historically, few pharmacological therapies have successfully mitigated HFpEF, making the emergence of effective treatments particularly significant. This review evaluates recent evidence on the therapeutic potential of semaglutide for managing HFpEF, especially in the obese population. Results from the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials demonstrate that semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist originally developed for type 2 diabetes but now also approved for obesity treatment, significantly improves clinical outcomes such as symptom scores, body weight, exercise capacity, and inflammation markers in the obese population suffering from HFpEF. These improvements are attributed to both the weight loss induced by semaglutide and its direct effects on the congestive pathophysiology of HFpEF. The efficacy of semaglutide offers new hope for addressing a condition that has long lacked effective pharmacological interventions.",['Kusayev J; Levy Y; Weininger D; Frishman WH; Aronow WS'],2024,"HFpEF is an increasingly prevalent condition, particularly among the aging population in the united states. the emergence of effective treatments has been a key factor in the emergence of effective therapies."
FASTMAP-a flexible and scalable immunopeptidomics pipeline for HLA- and antigen-specific T-cell epitope mapping based on artificial antigen-presenting cells.,"The study of peptide repertoires presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and the identification of potential T-cell epitopes contribute to a multitude of immunopeptidome-based treatment approaches. Epitope mapping is essential for the development of promising epitope-based approaches in vaccination as well as for innovative therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. It also plays a critical role in the immunogenicity assessment of protein therapeutics with regard to safety and efficacy concerns. The main challenge emerges from the highly polymorphic nature of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules leading to the requirement of a peptide mapping strategy for a single HLA allele. As many autoimmune diseases are linked to at least one specific antigen, we established FASTMAP, an innovative strategy to transiently co-transfect a single HLA allele combined with a disease-specific antigen into a human cell line. This approach allows the specific identification of HLA-bound peptides using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Using FASTMAP, we found a comparable spectrum of endogenous peptides presented by the most frequently expressed HLA alleles in the world's population compared to what has been described in literature. To ensure a reliable peptide mapping workflow, we combined the HLA alleles with well-known human model antigens like coagulation factor VIII, acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha, protein structures of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and myelin basic protein. Using these model antigens, we have been able to identify a broad range of peptides that are in line with already published and <i>in silico</i> predicted T-cell epitopes of the specific HLA/model antigen combination. The transient co-expression of a single affinity-tagged MHC molecule combined with a disease-specific antigen in a human cell line in our FASTMAP pipeline provides the opportunity to identify potential T-cell epitopes/endogenously processed MHC-bound peptides in a very cost-effective, fast, and customizable system with high-throughput potential.",['Weisbrod L; Capriotti L; Hofmann M; Spieler V; Dersch H; Voedisch B; Schmidt P; Knake S'],2024,"peptide mapping is essential for the development of promising epitope-based approaches in vaccination as well as for innovative therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. the main challenge emerges from the highly polymorphic nature of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules leading to the requirement of a peptide mapping strategy for a single HLA allele."
Tuberculosis-diabetes comorbidities: Mechanistic insights for clinical considerations and treatment challenges.,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among infectious diseases, particularly in poor countries. Viral infections, multidrug-resistant and ex-tensively drug-resistant TB strains, as well as the coexistence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus (DM) greatly aggravate TB morbidity and mortality. DM [particularly type 2 DM (T2DM)] and TB have converged making their control even more challenging. Two contemporary global epidemics, TB-DM behaves like a syndemic, a synergistic confluence of two highly prevalent diseases. T2DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment. Since a bidirectional relationship exists between TB and DM, it is necessary to concurrently treat both, and promote recommendations for the joint management of both diseases. There are also some drug-drug interactions resulting in adverse treatment outcomes in TB-DM patients including treatment failure, and reinfection. In addition, autophagy may play a role in these comorbidities. Therefore, the TB-DM comorbidities present several health challenges, requiring a focus on multidisciplinary collaboration and integrated strategies, to effectively deal with this double burden. To effectively manage the comorbidity, further screening in affected countries, more suitable drugs, and better treatment strategies are required.",['Al-Bari MAA; Peake N; Eid N'],2024,TB-DM is a risk factor for developing more severe forms of multi-drug resistant-TB and TB recurrence after preventive treatment.

Examination of the role of mutualism in immune evasion.,"Though the earliest stages of oncogenesis, post initiation, are not well understood, it is generally appreciated that a successful transition from a collection of dysregulated cells to an aggressive tumour requires complex ecological interactions between cancer cells and their environment. One key component of tumorigenesis is immune evasion. To investigate the interplay amongst the ecological behaviour of mutualism and immune evasion, we used a computational simulation framework. Sensitivity analyses of the growth of a virtual tumour implemented as a 2D-hexagonal lattice model suggests tumour survival depends on the interplay between growth rates, mutualism and immune evasion. In 60% of simulations, cancer clones with low growth rates, but exhibiting mutualism were able to evade the immune system and continue progressing suggesting that tumours with equivalent growth rates and no mutualism are more likely to be eliminated than tumours with mutualism. Tumours with faster growth rates showed a lower dependence upon mutualism for progression. Geostatistical analysis showed decreased spatial heterogeneity over time for polyclonal tumours with a high division rate. Overall, these results suggest that in slow growing tumours, mutualism is critical for early tumorigenesis.",['Gourmet L; Walker-Samuel S; Mallick P'],2024,immune evasion is a key component of tumorigenesis. a successful transition from a collection of dysregulated cells to an aggressive tumour requires complex ecological interactions between cancer cells and their environment.
Androgens Modulate the Immune Profile in a Mouse Model of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a low-grade inflammation, but it is unknown how hyperandrogenism, the hallmark of PCOS, affects the immune system. Using a PCOS-like mouse model, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism affects immune cell populations in reproductive, metabolic, and immunological tissues differently in a site-specific manner. Co-treatment with an androgen receptor antagonist prevents most of these alterations, demonstrating that these effects are mediated through androgen receptor activation. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-exposed mice displayed a drastically reduced eosinophil population in the uterus and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). A higher frequency of natural killer (NK) cells and elevated levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α are seen in uteri of androgen-exposed mice, while NK cells in VAT and spleen displayed a higher expression level of CD69, a marker of activation or tissue residency. Distinct alterations of macrophages in the uterus, ovaries, and VAT are also found in DHT-exposed mice and can potentially be linked to PCOS-like traits of the model. Indeed, androgen-exposed mice are insulin-resistant, albeit unaltered fat mass. Collectively, it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT, which can have considerable implications on tissue function and contribute to the reduced fertility and metabolic comorbidities associated with PCOS.",['Torstensson S; Ascani A; Risal S; Lu H; Zhao A; Espinosa A; Lindgren E; Johansson MH; Eriksson G; Barakat M; Karlsson MCI; Svensson C; Benrick A; Stener-Victorin E'],2024,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a low-grade inflammation. but it is unknown how hyperandrogenism affects the immune system. it is demonstrated that hyperandrogenism causes tissue-specific alterations of immune cells in reproductive organs and VAT.
Time of day and glycaemic response in pregnant women: A gap in current guidelines?,"Advice to monitor and distribute carbohydrate intake is a key recommendation for treatment of gestational diabetes, but fails to consider circadian regulation of glucose homeostasis. In the non-pregnant state, glucose responses to a meal at night-time are significantly higher than during the day and are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. However, the impact of night time eating on postprandial glucose in pregnancy is uncertain. Using a systematic approach we explored postprandial glucose responses to dietary intake at night compared to during the day in pregnant women. Searches were conducted in four databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL plus and Scopus), in September 2022 (updated, June 2023). Eligible studies reported on postprandial glucose at a minimum of two times a day, after identical meals or an oral glucose tolerance test, in pregnant women with or without gestational diabetes. Publication bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Four eligible studies were retrieved. Two studies reported within group comparison of two timepoints, and observed reduced glucose tolerance in the afternoon compared to the morning in pregnant women, irrespective of diabetes status. The other two studies meeting inclusion criteria did not report time of day comparisons. It is unclear as to whether the higher (and extended) postprandial glucose levels observed at night in non-pregnant populations are observed in pregnancy. Clinical studies are needed to explore the impact of circadian rhythmicity on glucose metabolism during pregnancy, and the implications of current dietary advice on when and what to eat for management of gestational diabetes.",['Tan NA; Davidson ZE; Grieger JA; Bonham MP'],2024,postprandial glucose responses to dietary intake at night are significantly higher than during the day. the impact of night time eating on postprandial glucose in pregnancy is uncertain.
Kidney transplantation in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a disorder of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway associated with the development of multisystem tumors, including renal angiomyolipoma (AML). These renal tumors are benign by nature but locally invasive and carry a risk for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). The frequency of subsequent renal transplantation in this population is largely uncharacterized, although single-center data suggests that 5%-15% of adult TSC patients are kidney transplant recipients. This retrospective cohort study utilized United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data. We included candidates waitlisted between 1987 and 2020 for a first kidney transplant with TSC-associated kidney failure. We utilized descriptive statistics to characterize the frequency of first-time kidney transplant waitlisting and transplantation among persons with TSC and the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model to evaluate characteristics associated with progression from waitlist. We identified 200 TSC-associated kidney failure patients within the waitlist cohort. Of these, 12 were pediatric patients. Two-thirds (N = 134) of waitlisted persons were female. One hundred forty patients received a transplant with a median waitlist time of 2 years. Younger age at waitlisting was associated with a greater probability of progressing to transplant (HR 0.98 [95% CI: 0.96-0.99]). 91.8% of kidney transplant recipients survived 1-year post-transplant with a functioning allograft. The majority of patients with TSC who are waitlisted for a kidney transplant progress onto transplantation with excellent 1-year post transplant patient and allograft survival.",['Goedken AM; Ismail WW; Barrett LDG; Harshman LA'],2024,tuberculosis complex (TSC) is a disorder of the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway associated with the development of multisystem tumors. these renal tumors are benign by nature but locally invasive and carry a risk for the progression of chronic kidney disease to end stage kidney disease (ESKD)

A comprehensive investigation on alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation in hyperglycaemic conditions through <i>in vitro</i> experiments and computational analysis.,"Protein glycation, hyper-inflammatory reactions, and oxidative stress play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. The current work evaluated the protective ability of ethyl alcohol extract of leaves from holy basil (<i>Ocimum sanctum</i> Linn) against inflammation, oxidative stress, glycation and advanced glycation endproducts formation. Various <i>in vitro</i> assays assessed prementioned properties of holy basil. In addition, molecular docking was conducted. The highest hydrogen peroxide reduction activity (72.7 %) and maximum percentage of DPPH scavenging (71.3 %) depicted its vigorous antioxidant abilities. Furthermore, it showed the most excellent protection against proteinase activity (67.247 %), prevention of denaturation of egg albumin (65.29 %), and BSA (bovine serum albumin) (68.87 %) with 600 µg/ml. Percent aggregation index (57.528 %), browning intensity (56.61 %), and amyloid structure (57.0 %) were all reduced significantly using 600 μg/ml of extract. Additionally, the antimicrobial potential was also confirmed. According to a molecular docking study, active leaf extract ingredients were found to bind with superoxide dismutase, catalase, and carbonic anhydrase.

The effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell exosomes on acute myeloid leukemia's biological functions: a focus on the potential role of LncRNAs.,"Acute myeloid leukemia represents a group of malignant blood disorders that originate from clonal over-proliferation and the differentiation failure of hematopoietic precursors, resulting in the accumulation of blasts in the bone marrow. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been shown to exert diverse effects on tumor cells through direct and indirect interaction. Exosomes, as one of the means of indirect intercellular communication, are released from different types of cells, including MSCs, and their various contents, such as lncRNAs, enable them to exert significant impacts on target cells. Our study aims to investigate the effects of BM-MSC exosomes on the cellular and molecular characterization of HL-60 AML cells, particularly detecting the alterations in the expression of lncRNAs involved in AML leukemogenesis, cell growth, drug resistance, and poor prognosis. BM-MSCs were cultured with serum-free culture media to isolate exosomes from their supernatants. The validation of exosomes was performed in three stages: morphological analysis using TEM, size evaluation using DLS, and CD marker identification using flow cytometry. Subsequently, the HL-60 AML cells were treated with isolated BM-MSC exosomes to determine the impact of their contents on leukemic cells. Cell metabolic activity was evaluated by the MTT assay, while cell cycle progression, apoptosis, ROS levels, and proliferation were assessed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, RT-qPCR was conducted to determine the expression levels of lncRNAs and apoptosis-, ROS-, and cell cycle-related genes. MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis revealed that BM-MSC exosomes considerably suppressed cell metabolic activity, proliferation, and cell cycle progression. Also, these exosomes could effectively increase apoptosis and ROS levels in HL-60 cells. The expression levels of p53, p21, BAX, and FOXO4 were increased, while the BCL2 and c-Myc levels decreased. MALAT1, HOTAIR, and H19 expression levels were also significantly decreased in treated HL-60 cells compared to their untreated counterparts. BM-MSC exosomes suppress cell cycle progression, proliferation, and metabolic activity while simultaneously elevating the ROS index and apoptosis ratio in HL-60 cells, likely by reducing the expression levels of MALAT1, HOTAIR, and H19. These findings suggest that BM-MSC exosomes might serve as potential supportive therapies for leukemia.",['Jalilivand S; Izadirad M; Vazifeh Shiran N; Gharehbaghian A; Naserian S'],2024,BM-MSC exosomes are released from different types of cells. they exert diverse effects on tumor cells through direct and indirect interaction. lncRNAs are released from different types of cells.
First report of anthracnose of <i>Lithocarpus polystachyus</i> caused by <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i> in China.,"Lithocarpus polystachyus (Wall. ex A. DC.), an economically valuable plant species belonging to the Fagaceae family, has been used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves (Shang et al. 2022). In July 2022, the severe leaf lesion on L. polystachyus was first observed in Yongshun County, Xiangxi autonomous prefecture (28°45'34''N, 109°40'11''E), Hunan province, China. Yongshun County is characterized by hills and mountains, situated in a subtropical region with a mild and humid climate. A second outbreak in July 2023 was observed in the same area. The observed incident rates in the past two years were 87.3% and 90.6%, respectively. Once infected, almost all plant leaves will be infected, leading to a substantial reduction in the yield of L. polystachyus. The disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifested as brown spots. These lesions frequently merged into larger, dark-brown areas along the leaf margins before eventually wilting. To ascertain the pathogenic species responsible for this disease, fungal isolation was conducted using a tissue separation method (Xu et al. 2023). The infected leaf tissues were surface-disinfected with 75% ethanol and 0.1% HgCl then small pieces (1×1 cm), were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (Sigma-Aldrich, 70139) and incubated at 28°C for 6-9 days. Colonies were villiform and initially white, becoming gray after 6 days. Sterilized dissecting needles were used to pick single hyphal tips from the edge of the colonies and placed onto PDA for strain purification. After 15 days, the purified colonies grew fluffy white hyphae with abundant conidia. The conidia were cylindrical, had round ends, and ranged from 5.75 to 14.83 μm long and 1.75 to 2.38 μm wide (n=50). According to morphological and cultural characteristics, these isolates were preliminarily identified as Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde (Damm et al. 2012). To further affirm the identity of the pathogen, DNA was extracted from mycelia using a DNA extraction kit (Sigma-Aldrich, G2N70). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the transcription elongation factor (TEF), and the actin (ACT) gene were then amplified from genomic DNA extracted from three isolates (Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3) using specific primers. The primers utilized were ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R and ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999) for ITS region, transcription elongation factor gene and actin gene amplification, respectively. Sequence identity indicated that these isolates were highly homologous to C. fructicola. The ITS (Genbank No. PP002156, OR880553 and OR880554), TEF (No. PP061421, PP061422 and PP061423), and ACT (No. PP061418, PP061419 and PP061420) sequences of the isolates Cof1, Cof2, and Cof3 shared 99 to 100% identity with their counterparts (No. OR083309, MF627961, and OQ427895) in C. fructicola, respectively. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed using MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) also indicated that these isolates were C. fructicola. Both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the identification of this pathogen as C. fructicola. Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose disease in a variety of economically important crops (Sharma and Kulshrestha 2015). To further validate the ability of the isolated C. fructicola to induce the same symptoms as observed in the field, the pathogenicity assay was assessed following Koch's postulates (Gradmann, 2014). Conidial suspensions (1×105 conidia per mL) from three isolates were individually inoculated onto artificially wounded leaves of 3-year-old L. polystachyus. Negative controls were established by inoculating leaf wounds with sterile distilled water. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 28°C and 90% humidity with a 12-h photoperiod. The experiment was replicated three times. Necrotic lesions were observed on all pathogen-inoculated wounds within 6 days after inoculation, whereas controls showed no observable symptoms. Morphological and molecular characterization of re-isolated pathogens from infected leaves indicated that the pathogens were identical. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose of L. polystachyus caused by C. fructicola in China. Farmers in the local mountainous areas are economically reliant on L. polystachyus production, while anthracnose has caused over half of the trees to lose their commercial value, resulting in significant economic losses. Our findings hold great promise for advancing strategies in the prevention and treatment of anthracnose in L. polystachyus.",['Jiang Y; Chen H; Chen H; Li K; Xiao S; Li D; Chen J'],2024,"a second outbreak in yongshun county, Xiangxi, was observed in the same area. the disease presented symptoms characterized by round or irregularly shaped lesions that initially manifest as brown spots. the disease was used as herbal tea to prevent diabetes because of the high content of flavonoids and dihydrochalcones in the leaves."
Diabetes Distress Among the Roma Population From a Tertiary Care Center in Romania.,"Background Distress in patients with diabetes is a condition that has received significant attention in recent years; however, data regarding the psychological assessment and the impact of the emotional burden of diabetes among the Roma population are still scarce in the medical literature. Material and methods We conducted an observational, transversal study that included 310 adult patients with diabetes mellitus, aged between 18 and 85 years old, of which the majority (61%) were women; patients were selected from a tertiary hospital providing diabetes care; diabetes distress was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire, the diabetes distress scale (DDS), validated on Romanian patients. Results In the study population, a great proportion of patients showed diabetes distress, with 24.8% (N=82) having moderate distress and 29.7% (N=121) having severe distress. In the Caucasian group, there were significantly more patients without distress than in the Roma patients,while on the contrary, more Roma patients experienced severe distress compared to the opposite group (64.5%, N=78 versus 35.5%, N=43). In the Caucasian group, a statistical significance was observed regarding interpersonal distress, with Caucasian women having a higher score than men. Concerning the Roma patients, total DDS and all subscales´ scores were statistically significant, with Roma women having higher scores than men. A statistical significance was observed between ethnicity and diabetes distress scores, with the Roma population having higher median values than Caucasian patients. It was also demonstrated that the lack of education, a higher diabetes evolution, and a higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level (above 8%) have influenced the risk of severe DDS in the Caucasian group, while in the Roma patients, employment status (being unemployed) represents a risk factor for severe DDS. Conclusion The Roma patients included in our study experienced higher distress scores compared to Caucasians. These results are substantial as they emphasize the need to include the evaluation of diabetes distress in clinical practice to facilitate the early initiation of intervention measures. There is nevertheless limited data regarding this particular ethnic group; therefore, further research is still needed.",['Cosoreanu A; Rusu E; Mihai DA; Rusu F; Pantea I; Paunica I; Ungureanu I; Radulian G'],2024,"study included 310 adult patients with diabetes mellitus aged between 18 and 85 years old. majority of patients were women; patients were selected from a tertiary hospital providing diabetes care. diabetes distress was evaluated using a standardized questionnaire, the diabetes distress scale (DDS), validated on Romanian patients."
Identification of Lipotoxicity-Related Biomarkers in Diabetic Nephropathy Based on Bioinformatic Analysis.,"<b>Objective:</b> This study is aimed at investigating diagnostic biomarkers associated with lipotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetic nephropathy (DN). <b>Methods:</b> The GSE96804 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was utilized to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DN patients. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted using the DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established to identify key genes linked to lipotoxicity in DN. Immune infiltration analysis was employed to identify immune cells with differential expression in DN and to assess the correlation between these immune cells and lipotoxicity-related hub genes. The findings were validated using the external dataset GSE104954. ROC analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of the hub genes. The Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) enrichment method was utilized to analyze the key genes associated with lipotoxicity as mentioned above. <b>Result:</b> In this study, a total of 544 DEGs were identified. Among them, extracellular matrix (ECM), fatty acid metabolism, AGE-RAGE, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were significantly enriched. Combining the PPI network and lipotoxicity-related genes (LRGS), LUM and ALB were identified as lipotoxicity-related diagnostic biomarkers for DN. ROC analysis showed that the AUC values for LUM and ALB were 0.882 and 0.885, respectively. The AUC values for LUM and ALB validated in external datasets were 0.98 and 0.82, respectively. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant changes in various immune cells during disease progression. Macrophages M2, mast cells activated, and neutrophils were significantly associated with all lipotoxicity-related hub genes. These key genes were enriched in fatty acid metabolism and extracellular matrix-related pathways. <b>Conclusion:</b> The identified lipotoxicity-related hub genes provide a deeper understanding of the development mechanisms of DN, potentially offering new theoretical foundations for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets related to lipotoxicity in DN.",['Nie H; Yang H; Cheng L; Yu J'],2024,gene expression Omnibus dataset was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DN patients. a protein-protein interaction network was established to identify key genes linked to lipotoxicity in DN.
Racial inequities and rare <i>CFTR</i> variants: Impact on cystic fibrosis diagnosis and treatment.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) has been traditionally viewed as a disease that affects White individuals. However, CF occurs among all races, ethnicities, and geographic ancestries. The disorder results from mutations in the <i>CF transmembrane conductance regulator</i> (<i>CFTR</i>). Varying incidence of CF is reported among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), who typically exhibit worse clinical outcomes. These populations are more likely to carry rare <i>CFTR</i> variants omitted from newborn screening panels, leading to disparities in care such as delayed diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we present a case-in-point describing an individual of Gambian descent identified with CF. Patient genotype includes a premature termination codon (PTC) (c.2353C>T) and previously undescribed single nucleotide deletion (c.1970delG), arguing against effectiveness of currently available CFTR modulator-based interventions. Strategies for overcoming these two variants will likely include combinations of PTC suppressors, nonsense mediated decay inhibitors, and/or alternative approaches (e.g. gene therapy). Investigations such as the present study establish a foundation from which therapeutic treatments may be developed. Importantly, c.2353C>T and c.1970delG were not detected in the patient by traditional <i>CFTR</i> screening panels, which include an implicit racial and ethnic diagnostic bias as these tests are comprised of mutations largely observed in people of European ancestry. We suggest that next-generation sequencing of <i>CFTR</i> should be utilized to confirm or exclude a CF diagnosis, in order to equitably serve BIPOC individuals. Additional epidemiologic data, basic science investigations, and translational work are imperative for improving understanding of disease prevalence and progression, <i>CFTR</i> variant frequency, genotype-phenotype correlation, pharmacologic responsiveness, and personalized medicine approaches for patients with African ancestry and other historically understudied geographic lineages.",['Wu M; Davis JD; Zhao C; Daley T; Oliver KE'],2024,"CF occurs among all races, ethnicities, and geographic ancestries. a racial bias is not detected in the patient. a c.2353C>T and c.1970delG were not detected in the patient."
Impact of Recurrent Weight Gain Thresholds on Comorbid Conditions Progression Following Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.,"Defining recurrent weight gain after metabolic bariatric surgery poses a significant challenge. Our study aimed to standardize recurrent weight gain measurements in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and ascertain its association with comorbidity progression. We conducted a retrospective data analysis on 122 patients who underwent LSG, tracking their progress over 2-7 years. Data on weight, blood pressure measurements, and laboratory tests were collected, focusing on the postoperative period to identify nadir weight, total weight loss, and recurrent weight gain. Significant weight loss and comorbidity remission were noted, with diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showing substantial remission rates of 85.71%, 68.24%, and 85.37%, respectively. The median recurrent weight gain was 6.30 kg within 12 months of the nadir. Progression proportion of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were 8.20%, 44.26%, and 40.98%, respectively. Hypertension progression was strongly associated with a recurrent weight gain ≥ 10 kg and ≥ 20% of maximum weight loss. Dyslipidemia progression was significantly correlated with recurrent weight gain ≥ 10 kg and ≥ 20% of maximum weight loss. Diabetes progression was significantly correlated with recurrent weight gain ≥ 10% of pre-surgery body weight and ≥ 25% of maximum weight loss. A ≥ 10% weight gain of maximum weight loss did not significantly impact the progression of these conditions. Recurrent weight gain ≥ 20% of maximum weight loss can be treated as a specific threshold indicating comorbidity progression post-LSG. Standardizing the measurement of recurrent weight gain can help healthcare providers to implement targeted management strategies to optimize long-term health outcomes.",['Chin WL; Tu WL; Yang TH; Chen CY; Chen JH; Hung TT'],2024,recurrent weight gain measurements in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were standardized. a retrospective data analysis was conducted on 122 patients who underwent LSG.
Response to semaglutide of non-drinker subjects with type 2 diabetes.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) displays a worse prognosis in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D); effective treatments are, so far, scanty. Semaglutide showed efficacy in improving steatohepatitis. We longitudinally observed a MASLD cohort of T2D subjects starting semaglutide, to detect an improvement of non-invasive surrogates of steatosis and fibro-inflammatory liver involvement, evaluating the role of mild alcohol consumption. In 62 overweight/obese T2D subjects with MASLD (36 non-drinker and 26 mild alcohol consumers), anthropometric, bio-humoral and transient elastography (TE) data were collected before (T0) and after an average time of 6.4 month (T1) from injective semaglutide prescription. Circulating levels of hormones (GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin) and inflammatory markers (TNFα, MCP-1, IL-18, IL-10) were measured. Steatotic and necro-inflammatory liver involvement was evaluated with FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness (LS), respectively. Significant (p < 0.006) T0-T1 reductions of BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and HbA1c were observed. AST (-10 ± 3 IU/L), ALT (-18 ± 5 IU/L), GGT (-33 ± 15 IU/L), CAP (-25 ± 8 dB/m) and LS (-0.8 ± 0.4 kPa) were reduced, too. GLP-1 increased (+ 95.9 pM, p < 0.0001) and IL-18 was reduced (-46.6 pg/ml, p = 0.0002). After adjustment for confounders, CAP improving was only related to GLP-1 increase (ß=-0.437, p = 0.0122). Mild alcohol intake did not influence these relations. Use of semaglutide in subjects with T2D and MASLD is associated with a significant decline of liver steatosis and necroinflammation proxies; mild alcohol assumption did not exert any influence. An independent effect of GLP-1 raise was observed on reduction of steatosis, irrespective of alcohol consumption.",['Petralli G; Raggi F; Zoppo AD; Rovera C; Salvati A; Brunetto MR; Solini A'],2024,a MASLD cohort of T2D subjects started semaglutide. steatohepatitis is worse prognosis than mild alcohol consumption. effective treatments are scanty.

SDHAF1 confers metabolic resilience to aging hematopoietic stem cells by promoting mitochondrial ATP production.,"Aging generally predisposes stem cells to functional decline, impairing tissue homeostasis. Here, we report that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) acquire metabolic resilience that promotes cell survival. High-resolution real-time ATP analysis with glucose tracing and metabolic flux analysis revealed that old HSCs reprogram their metabolism to activate the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), becoming more resistant to oxidative stress and less dependent on glycolytic ATP production at steady state. As a result, old HSCs can survive without glycolysis, adapting to the physiological cytokine environment in bone marrow. Mechanistically, old HSCs enhance mitochondrial complex II metabolism during stress to promote ATP production. Furthermore, increased succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 1 (SDHAF1) in old HSCs, induced by physiological low-concentration thrombopoietin (TPO) exposure, enables rapid mitochondrial ATP production upon metabolic stress, thereby improving survival. This study provides insight into the acquisition of resilience through metabolic reprogramming in old HSCs and its molecular basis to ameliorate age-related hematopoietic abnormalities.",['Watanuki S; Kobayashi H; Sugiura Y; Yamamoto M; Karigane D; Shiroshita K; Sorimachi Y; Morikawa T; Fujita S; Shide K; Haraguchi M; Tamaki S; Mikawa T; Kondoh H; Nakano H; Sumiyama K; Nagamatsu G; Goda N; Okamoto S; Nakamura-Ishizu A; Shimoda K; Suematsu M; Suda T; Takubo K'],2024,hematopoietic stem cells acquire metabolic resilience that promotes cell survival. old HSCs reprogram their metabolism to activate the pentose phosphate pathway. a new study shows that old HSCs can survive without glycolysis.
The impact of whole-process visualization collaborative nursing discussions education on perioperative symptoms and emotional well-being in radical prostatectomy patients.,"Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasms in elderly males, with radical prostatectomy being the established therapeutic approach for localized disease. Patients undergoing this surgical procedure frequently experience increased negative emotions and symptomatology during the perioperative period, likely due to concerns about the illness and its treatment. The present study aims to investigate the effects of a novel educational approach involving a whole-process visualization and collaborative nursing discussions on perioperative symptoms and emotional well-being in radical prostatectomy patients. Data were prospectively collected from 310 patients admitted to the hospital between June 2021 and December 2023, all of whom were scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. These patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (receiving new model education) or the control group (receiving conventional education), with 155 patients in each group. The study compared basic demographic information, anxiety and depression scores, fear of disease progression scores, quality-of-life scores, main symptom scores, and changes in perioperative vital signs between the two groups. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of age, comorbidities, insurance type, education level, income, and tumor history (P > 0.05). Similarly, there were no significant differences in anxiety and depression scores, proportion of patients with anxiety and depression, vital signs, and fear of disease progression scores between the two groups at Time 1 stage (P > 0.05). During stages Time 2 and Time 3, the intervention group exhibited lower anxiety and depression scores, a lower proportion of anxious and depressed patients, as well as significantly reduced blood pressure and heart rate fluctuations compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Following radical prostatectomy, the main symptoms of patients, such as pain, nausea, and fatigue, were assessed using the MADIS Symptom Assessment Scale on days 1-3 post-surgery. The intervention group exhibited significantly lower scores for three symptoms compared to the control group (P < 0.05); at Time 4 stage, the patients in the intervention group also demonstrated significantly improved quality-of-life scores compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, blood pressure and heart rate of patients returned to baseline levels at Time 4 stage, with no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, the anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group at the Time 4 stage remained significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, the fear of disease progression scores in both groups were lower than those at the Time 1 stage, with a more pronounced improvement observed in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Patients diagnosed with malignant tumors often experience fear and anxiety regarding the progression of their disease and upcoming surgery, as well as uncertainty surrounding their treatment and prognosis. This heightened emotional distress can contribute to a greater symptom burden during the perioperative period. Utilizing a whole-process visualization and collaborative nursing discussion approach, as compared to traditional communication methods, has been shown to alleviate patients' fears, reduce anxiety and depression, and ultimately lessen the symptom burden experienced during the perioperative phase. Ultimately, this approach can enhance the overall quality of life for patients facing malignant tumors.",['Wu D; Jin B; Li J; Chen T; Gu T'],2024,310 patients admitted to the hospital between June 2021 and December 2023. they were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or control group. no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups.
Removal and risk assessment of emerging contaminants and heavy metals in a wastewater reuse process producing drinkable water for human consumption.,"This study focuses on the removal and risk assessment of twenty emerging contaminants (ECs) and heavy metals in a REMIX water treatment plant (RWTP) that produces drinking water from combination of wastewater reuse and desalination. The membrane biological reactor (MBR) exhibit removal rates exceeding 95% of pharmaceuticals like acetaminophen, trimethoprim, diclofenac, naproxen, and emtricitabine. The efficiency of brackish reverse osmosis (BWRO) in removing ECs is highlighted, showing substantial efficacy with reduction rates of 99.5%, 75.5%, and 51.2% for sulfamethoxazole, venlafaxine, and benzotriazole, respectively. The advanced oxidation process based on Fenton process reveals removal (>95%) of emtricitabine, efavirenz, and carbamazepine. The study confirms that the combination of treatment units within the RWTP effectively removes heavy metals (>90%), complying with acceptable limits. Risk quotient (RQ) calculations indicate the efficiency of the RWTP in EC removal, serving as benchmarks for public acceptance of reclaimed water. In the context of heavy metals, the study concludes negligible cancer risks associated with reclaimed water consumption over a lifetime. Quantitative structure-activity relationship and occurrence, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (OPBT) models were used to assess EC risk. The study screened and identified potential persistant, bio accumulating and toxic PBT ECs. Critical control points (CCPs) in the RWTP are identified, with brackish and seawater reverse osmosis (BWRO and SWRO) and advanced oxidation process (AOP) recognized as pivotal in hazard management.

Association of barium deficiency with Type 2 diabetes mellitus incident risk was mediated by mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN): A follow-up study.,"Accumulating evidence indicates that plasma metals levels may associate with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incident risk. Mitochondrial function such as mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) might be linked metal exposure and physiological metabolism. Mediation analysis was conducted to determine the mediating roles of mtDNA-CN in the associations of plasma metals with diabetes risk. In the present study, we investigated associations between plasma metals levels, mtDNA-CN and T2DM incident in elderly population with 6-year follow-up (2 times) study. Ten plasma metals (i.e. manganese (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), ferrum (Fe), barium (Ba), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), titanium (Ti) and cesium (Sr) were measured by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Mitochondrial DNA copy number was measured by real-time PCR. Multivariable linear regression and logistic regression models were carried out to estimate the relationship between plasma metal concentrations, mtDNA-CN and T2DM incident risk in the current work. Plasma Ba deficiency and mtDNA-CN decline associated with T2DM incident risk during aging process. Meanwhile plasma Ba found to be positively associated with mtDNA-CN. Mitochondrial function mtDNA-CN demonstrated mediating effects in association between plasma Ba deficiency and T2DM incident risk, and 49.8% of the association was mediated by mtDNA-CN. These findings extend the knowledge of T2DM incident risk factors and highlight the point that mtDNA-CN may be linked metals element and T2DM incident risk.",['Zhang Y; Ye J; Zhou L; Xuan X; Xu L; Cao X; Lv T; Yan J; Zhang S; Wang Y; Huang Q; Tian M'],2024,mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) may be linked to metal exposure and physiological metabolism. mediator analysis was conducted to determine mediating roles of mtDNA-CN in the associations of plasma metals with diabetes risk.
Selective haematological cancer eradication with preserved haematopoiesis.,"Haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for a broad range of haematological malignancies, but the standard of care relies on untargeted chemotherapies and limited possibilities to treat malignant cells after HSCT without affecting the transplanted healthy cells<sup>1</sup>. Antigen-specific cell-depleting therapies hold the promise of much more targeted elimination of diseased cells, as witnessed in the past decade by the revolution of clinical practice for B cell malignancies<sup>2</sup>. However, target selection is complex and limited to antigens expressed on subsets of haematopoietic cells, resulting in a fragmented therapy landscape with high development costs<sup>2-5</sup>. Here we demonstrate that an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting the pan-haematopoietic marker CD45 enables the antigen-specific depletion of the entire haematopoietic system, including HSCs. Pairing this ADC with the transplantation of human HSCs engineered to be shielded from the CD45-targeting ADC enables the selective eradication of leukaemic cells with preserved haematopoiesis. The combination of CD45-targeting ADCs and engineered HSCs creates an almost universal strategy to replace a diseased haematopoietic system, irrespective of disease aetiology or originating cell type. We propose that this approach could have broad implications beyond haematological malignancies.","[""Garaudé S; Marone R; Lepore R; Devaux A; Beerlage A; Seyres D; Dell' Aglio A; Juskevicius D; Zuin J; Burgold T; Wang S; Katta V; Manquen G; Li Y; Larrue C; Camus A; Durzynska I; Wellinger LC; Kirby I; Van Berkel PH; Kunz C; Tamburini J; Bertoni F; Widmer CC; Tsai SQ; Simonetta F; Urlinger S; Jeker LT""]",2024,hsc transplantation is the only curative treatment for haematological malignancies. but the standard of care relies on untargeted chemotherapies and limited possibilities to treat malignant cells after HSCT. antigen-specific cell-depleting therapies hold the promise of much more targeted elimination of diseased cells.
"Formulation of Saxagliptin Oral Films: Optimization, Physicochemical Characterization, In-Vivo Assessment, and In-Vitro Real-Time Release Monitoring via a Novel Polyaniline Nanoparticles-Based Solid-Contact Screen Printed Ion-Selective Electrode.","Oral dispersible films have received broad interest due to fast drug absorption and no first-path metabolism, leading to high bioavailability and better patient compliance. Saxagliptin (SXG) is an antidiabetic drug that undergoes first-path metabolism, resulting in a less active metabolite, so the development of SXG oral dispersible films (SXG-ODFs) improves SXG bioavailability. The formula optimisation included a response surface experimental design and the impact of three formulation factors, the type and concentration of polymer and plasticiser concentration on in-vitro disintegration time and folding endurance. Two optimised SXG-ODFs prepared using either polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose were investigated. SXG-ODFs prepared with PVA demonstrated a superior rapid disintegration time, ranging from 17 to 890 s, with the fastest disintegration time recorded at 17 s. These short durations can be attributed to the hydrophilic nature of PVA, facilitating rapid hydration and disintegration upon contact with saliva. Additionally, PVA-based films displayed remarkable folding endurance, surpassing 200 folds without rupture, indicating flexibility and stability. The high tensile strength of PVA-based films further underscores their robust mechanical properties, with tensile strength values reaching up to 4.53 MPa. SXG exhibits a UV absorption wavelength of around 212 nm, posing challenges for traditional quantitative spectrophotometric analysis, so a polyaniline nanoparticles-based solid-contact screen-printed ion-selective electrode (SP-ISE) was employed for the determination of SXG release profile effectively in comparison to HPLC. SP-ISE showed a better real-time release profile of SXG-ODFs, and the optimised formula showed lower blood glucose levels than commercial tablets.",['Makram TS; Eid SM; Abu-Dahab M; AbouGhaly MHH; Elnahas OS'],2024,oral dispersible films have received broad interest due to fast drug absorption. the development of SXG oral dispersible films improves SXG bioavailability. the formula optimisation included a response surface experimental design.
Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension: the Fukushima Cohort study.,"Malnutrition is reportedly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in various populations. However, associations between nutritional status and adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension have not been sufficiently elucidated. We therefore aimed to investigate the impact of nutritional status as evaluated by the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) on adverse outcomes in patients with hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1588 hypertensive patients enrolled in the Fukushima Cohort Study. Participants were categorized into tertiles (T1-T3) according to GNRI at baseline. The primary endpoint of the present study was a kidney event, defined as a combination of a 50% decline in eGFR from baseline and end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy. Associations between GNRI and kidney events were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Median age was 64 years, 55% were men, median eGFR was 63.1 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and median GNRI was 101.3. The lower GNRI group (T1) showed an increased incidence of kidney events in the Kaplan-Meier curve analysis. Compared to the highest GNRI group (T3), lower GNRI carried a higher risk of kidney events for both T2 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-2.68) and T1 (HR 3.59, 95%CI 1.96-6.63).

"Tai Chi compared with cognitive behavioral therapy and the reversal of systemic, cellular and genomic markers of inflammation in breast cancer survivors with Insomnia: A randomized clinical trial.","Insomnia contributes to inflammation in breast cancer survivors. This study evaluates whether insomnia treatment reverses inflammation in breast cancer survivors with insomnia. Participants (n = 90) were randomized to 3 months of Tai Chi (n = 45) or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)(n = 45), and followed for one year post-intervention to 15 month endpoint. Our previous report found that Tai Chi as compared to CBT-I resulted in similar rates of insomnia response and remission over 15 months. Here, we analyze changes in plasma C-reactive protein and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulated monocyte production of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF), and cellular pro-inflammatory and anti-viral gene expression (Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity RNA profile; CTRA) over 15 months. Insomnia treatment resulted in decreases in the TLR-4 stimulated monocyte production of IL-6, TNF, and their co-expression, as well as decreases in the CTRA profile, decreases inflammatory gene transcripts, and increases in anti-viral gene transcripts over 15 months (all P's < 0.01). In addition, as compared to CBT-I, Tai Chi resulted in greater decreases in plasma IL-6 (P < 0.05), and greater decreases in TLR-4 activated monocyte production of IL-6 and co-expression of IL-6 and TNF at 15 month endpoint. CBT-I resulted in greater increases in anti-viral gene transcripts. Administration of either CBT-I or Tai Chi effectively treats insomnia, and shows additional benefits of reducing cellular, and genomic markers of inflammation, and increasing anti-viral genomic markers in breast cancer survivors with insomnia. Tai Chi, as compared to CBT-I, yields greater and more durable decreases in systemic- and cellular inflammation. Targeting insomnia might mitigate the risk of inflammation-related co-morbidities in breast cancer survivors.",['Irwin MR; Hoang D; Olmstead R; Sadeghi N; Breen EC; Bower JE; Cole S'],2024,insomnia treatment reverses inflammation in breast cancer survivors with insomnia. participants were randomized to 3 months of Tai Chi (n = 45) or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)(n = 45) participants were followed for one year post-intervention to 15 month endpoint.
Estimated Pulse Wave Velocity as a Novel Non-Invasive Biomarker for Metabolic Syndrome Among People Living with HIV.,"This study aims to investigate the relationship between estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in people living with HIV (PLWH), proposing a novel and convenient predictor for early detection of MetS in PLWH. A total of 485 PLWH were enrolled. These participants were categorized into two groups based on the estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV) level. Demographic and clinical data were collected to investigate the correlation between ePWV and MetS. The cohort of 485 PLWH was categorized into high-ePWV and low-ePWV groups based on ePWV cutoff value of 10 m/s. We observed significant differences in components of MetS including triglycerides (TG, P < 0.05), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, P < 0.01), systolic blood pressure (SBP, P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, P < 0.05), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG, P < 0.001) between the two groups. Furthermore, we employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to demonstrate the effectiveness of ePWV as a predictive indicator for MetS in PLWH (AUC = 0.739, P < 0.001). According to the ROC curve, the optimal cut-off value of ePWV was 7.4 m/s, and its sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing MetS in PLWH were 79.03% and 64.07%, respectively. Although the 7.4 m/s cutoff increased the false positive rate compared to the traditional cutoff, it significantly reduced the rate of missed diagnoses, effectively identifying 79.03% of PLWH with MetS. ePWV is a non-invasive and convenient novel biomarker with predictive capabilities for MetS in PLWH.",['Chen S; Jiang Y; Lin X; Chen H; Wu X; Qian Z; Xu X; Zhong H; Peng J; Cai S'],2024,a total of 485 PLWH were enrolled. these participants were categorized into high-ePWV and low-ePWV groups. ePWV cutoff value was 7.4 m/s.
Grading Acanthosis Nigricans Using a Smartphone and Color Analysis: A Novel Noninvasive Method to Screen for Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Type 2 Diabetes.,"The objective of this study was to develop ANcam, a novel method for identifying acanthosis nigricans (AN) using a smartphone camera and computer-aided color analysis for noninvasive screening of people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Adult and juvenile participants with or without diagnosed type 2 diabetes were recruited in Trinidad and Tobago. After obtaining informed consent, participants' history, demographics, anthropometrics, and A1C were collected and recorded. Three subject matter experts independently graded pictures of the posterior neck and upper back using the ANcam smartphone application and Burke methods. A correlation matrix investigated 25 color channels for association with hyperpigmentation, and the diagnostic thresholds were determined with a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. For the 227 participants with captured images and A1C values, the cyan/magenta/yellow/black (CMYK) model color channel CMYK_K was best correlated with IGT at an A1C cutoff of 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) (<i>R</i> = 0.45, <i>P</i> <0.001). With high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.854), the cutoff of 7.67 CMYK_K units was chosen, with a sensitivity of 81.1% and a specificity of 70.3%. ANcam had low interrater variance (<i>F</i> = 1.99, <i>P</i> = 0.137) compared with Burke grading (<i>F</i> = 105.71, <i>P</i> <0.001). ANcam detected hyperpigmentation on the neck at double the self-reported frequency. Elevated BMI was 2.9 (95% CI 1.9-4.3) times more likely, elevated blood pressure was 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.4) times more likely, and greater waist-to-hip ratio was 2.3 (95% CI 1.4-3.6) times more likely with AN present. ANcam offers a sensitive, reproducible, and user-friendly IGT screening tool to any smartphone user that performs well with most skin tones and lighting conditions.",['Dhanoo AS; Ramroach SK; Hill-Briggs F; Cockburn BN'],2024,"ANcam was developed by acanthosis nigricans. participants with or without diagnosed type 2 diabetes were recruited in Trinidad and tobago.

Effect of preceding drug therapy on the renal and cardiovascular outcomes of combined sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.,"To conduct a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the RECAP study, who were treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) combination therapy, focusing only on those patients who had chronic kidney disease (CKD), to examine whether the composite renal outcome differed between those who received SGLT2 inhibitor treatment first and those who received a GLP-1RA first. We included 438 patients with CKD (GLP-1RA-first group, n = 223; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, n = 215) from the 643 T2D patients in the RECAP study. The incidence of the composite renal outcome, defined as progression to macroalbuminuria and/or a ≥50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was analysed using a propensity score (PS)-matched model. Furthermore, we calculated the win ratio for these composite renal outcomes, which were weighted in the following order: (1) both a ≥50% decrease in eGFR and progression to macroalbuminuria; (2) a decrease in eGFR of ≥50% only; and (3) progression to macroalbuminuria only. Using the PS-matched model, 132 patients from each group were paired. The incidence of renal composite outcomes did not differ between the two groups (GLP-1RA-first group, 10%; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, 17%; odds ratio 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 4.26; p = 0.12). The win ratio of the GLP-1RA-first group versus the SGLT2 inhibitor-first group was 1.83 (95% CI 1.71 to 1.95; p < 0.001). Although the renal composite outcome did not differ between the two groups, the win ratio of the GLP-1RA-first group versus the SGLT2 inhibitor-first group was significant. These results suggest that, in GLP-1RA and SGLT2 inhibitor combination therapy, the addition of an SGLT2 inhibitor to baseline GLP-1RA treatment may lead to more favourable renal outcomes.",['Tsukamoto S; Kobayashi K; Toyoda M; Tone A; Kawanami D; Suzuki D; Tsuriya D; Machimura H; Shimura H; Wakui H; Takeda H; Yokomizo H; Takeshita K; Chin K; Kanasaki K; Miyauchi M; Saburi M; Morita M; Yomota M; Kimura M; Hatori N; Nakajima S; Ito S; Murata T; Matsushita T; Furuki T; Hashimoto T; Umezono T; Muta Y; Takashi Y; Tamura K'],2024,"a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) was carried out. we included 438 patients with CKD (GLP-1RA-first group, n = 223; SGLT2 inhibitor-first group, n = 215) from the 643 patients in the RECAP study."
Phenolic enriched fraction of Clerodendrum glandulosum Lindl. leaf extract ameliorates hyperglycemia and oxidative stress in streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats.,"Clerodendrum glandulosum Lindl. is an important ethnomedicinal shrub of Northeast India, used by traditional healers to control various ailments like diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, etc. OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted to explore the anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidative effects of the polyphenol-rich fraction (PRF) of C. glandulosum leaf extract and identification of its major bioactive compounds. Further, an in-silico molecular docking study was also performed to understand the molecular interactions of the identified major compounds with some target proteins associated with diabetic complications. PRF was purified from the hydromethanolic (80% MeOH) extract of leaves and subjected to assessment of in-vitro antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties. It was also subjected to evaluate the ameliorative effect during streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced hyperglycemia in Wistar albino rats. An in-silico molecular docking study was also performed to complement the in-vitro/in-vivo studies. Chemical analysis of PRF showed the presence of phenolics like caffeic acid, verbascoside, isoverbascoside, and apigenin, of which verbascoside (598.14 ± 1.24 mg/g) was found to be the principal compound. In-vitro studies showed potent antioxidant (IC<sub>50</sub> of DPPH:32.45 ± 2.16 μg/mL; ABTS:39.08 ± 0.53 μg/mL) properties and excellent aldose reductase inhibition potential (IC<sub>50</sub> 2.18 ± 0.10 μg/mL). Treatment with PRF showed reduced blood glucose levels and increased plasma insulin levels. The results also indicate an improvement of endogenous antioxidants and suppression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) comparable to the standard. Molecular docking studies predicted promising interactions between the identified molecules and the crucial amino acid residues of the enzymes involved in the development of hyperglycemia. This study revealed the antihyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of partially purified fraction PRF of C. glandulosum leaves.",['Khound P; Deb PK; Bhattacharjee S; Medina KD; Sarma PP; Sarkar B; Devi R'],2024,the present study was conducted to explore the anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidative effects of the polyphenol-rich fraction (PRF) of C. glandulosum leaf extract. it was purified from the hydromethanolic (80% MeOH) extract of leaves and subjected to assessment of in-vitro antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties.
β-hydroxybutyrate alleviates neurological deficits by restoring glymphatic and inflammation after subarachnoid hemorrhage in mice.,"Both glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Studies have shown that β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. However, the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain. The SAH models were constructed by injection of arterial blood into cisterna Magana. Three groups of C57 mice were randomly assigned: Sham, SAH, and BHB. All mice were subjected to neurological function assessment, western blot, immunofluorescence double staining, and RNA-seq. Glymphatic system function was examined with tracer and immunofluorescence double staining, and the differential genes were examined with RNA-seq. In addition, the expression of related inflammation was detected. Compared with the SAH group, BHB reinstated AQP4 polarization by upregulating SNTA1 protein to enhance the glymphatic system. According to RNA-seq, the different genes were primarily connected to microglia activation, astrocytes, and inflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence further confirmed that the related inflammatory protein expression levels were upregulated. BHB attenuated neuroinflammation after SAH. Ultimately, it can mitigate the neurological deficits in SAH mice. The study reveals a novel mechanism that BHB treatment mitigates neurologic impairment in SAH mice. We propose that BHB may play a neuroprotective effect by enhancing glymphatic system function and attenuating neuroinflammatory subarachnoid hemorrhage.",['Tan X; Li X; Li R; Meng W; Xie Z; Li J; Pang Y; Huang G; Li L; Li H'],2024,glymphatic system dysfunction and inflammatory response aggravate neurological dysfunction after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) studies have shown that -hydroxybutyrate (BHB) may mitigate painful diabetic neuropathy by upregulating SNTA1 expression and reinstating AQP4 polarity. but the potential of BHB to ameliorate glymphatic system function and inflammatory response in SAH mice remains uncertain.
"<i>FBXO42</i> activity is required to prevent mitotic arrest, spindle assembly checkpoint activation and lethality in glioblastoma and other cancers.","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor in adults. To identify genes differentially required for the viability of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs), we performed functional genomic lethality screens comparing GSCs and control human neural stem cells. Among top-scoring hits in a subset of GBM cells was the F-box-containing gene <i>FBXO42</i>, which was also predicted to be essential in ∼15% of cell lines derived from a broad range of cancers. Mechanistic studies revealed that, in sensitive cells, <i>FBXO42</i> activity prevents chromosome alignment defects, mitotic cell cycle arrest and cell death. The cell cycle arrest, but not the cell death, triggered by <i>FBXO42</i> inactivation could be suppressed by brief exposure to a chemical inhibitor of Mps1, a key spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) kinase. <i>FBXO42</i>'s cancer-essential function requires its F-box and Kelch domains, which are necessary for FBXO42's substrate recognition and targeting by SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. However, none of FBXO42's previously proposed targets, including ING4, p53 and RBPJ, were responsible for the observed phenotypes. Instead, our results suggest that FBOX42 alters the activity of one or more proteins that perturb chromosome-microtubule dynamics in cancer cells, which in turn leads to induction of the SAC and cell death.",['Hoellerbauer P; Kufeld M; Arora S; Mitchell K; Girard EJ; Herman JA; Olson JM; Paddison PJ'],2024,a subset of gBM cells was the i>FBXO42/i> gene. the gene was predicted to be essential in 15% of cell lines. a chemical inhibitor of Mps1 kinase could suppress the cell cycle arrest.
Cardiovascular and Noncardiovascular Prescribing and Mortality After Takotsubo Comparison With Myocardial Infarction and General Population.,"Takotsubo syndrome is an increasingly common cardiac emergency with no known evidence-based treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate cardiovascular mortality and medication use after takotsubo syndrome. In a case-control study, all patients with takotsubo syndrome in Scotland between 2010 and 2017 (n = 620) were age, sex, and geographically matched to individuals in the general population (1:4, n = 2,480) and contemporaneous patients with acute myocardial infarction (1:1, n = 620). Electronic health record data linkage of mortality outcomes and drug prescribing were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Of the 3,720 study participants (mean age, 66 years; 91% women), 153 (25%) patients with takotsubo syndrome died over the median of 5.5 years follow-up. This exceeded mortality rates in the general population (N = 374 [15%]; HR: 1.78 [95% CI: 1.48-2.15], <i>P</i> < 0.0001), especially for cardiovascular (HR: 2.47 [95% CI: 1.81-3.39], <i>P</i> < 0.001) but also noncardiovascular (HR: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.16-1.87], <i>P</i> = 0.002) deaths. Mortality rates were lower for patients with takotsubo syndrome than those with myocardial infarction (31%, 195/620; HR: 0.76 [95% CI: 0.62-0.94], <i>P</i> = 0.012), which was attributable to lower rates of cardiovascular (HR: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.44-0.84], <i>P</i> = 0.002) but not non-cardiovascular (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.69-1.23], <i>P</i> = 0.59) deaths. Despite comparable medications use, cardiovascular therapies were consistently associated with better survival in patients with myocardial infarction but not in those with takotsubo syndrome. Diuretic (<i>P</i> = 0.01), anti-inflammatory (<i>P</i> = 0.002), and psychotropic (<i>P</i> < 0.001) therapies were all associated with worse outcomes in patients with takotsubo syndrome. In patients with takotsubo syndrome, cardiovascular mortality is the leading cause of death, and this is not associated with cardiovascular therapy use.",['Rudd AE; Horgan G; Khan H; Gamble DT; McGowan J; Sood A; McGeoch R; Irving J; Watt J; Leslie SJ; Petrie M; Lang C; Mills NL; Newby DE; Dawson DK'],2024,study was conducted in a case-control study. all patients with takotsubo syndrome in Scotland between 2010 and 2017. mortality rates were lower for patients with takotsubo syndrome.
PNPLA3 risk allele is associated with risk of hepatocellular carcinoma but not decompensation in compensated cirrhosis.,"The PNPLA3-rs738409-G, TM6SF2-rs58542926-T, and HSD17B13-rs6834314-A polymorphisms have been associated with cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and HCC. However, whether they remain associated with HCC and decompensation in people who already have cirrhosis remains unclear, which limits the clinical utility of genetics in risk stratification as HCC is uncommon in the absence of cirrhosis. We aimed to characterize the effects of PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and HSD17B13 genotype on hepatic decompensation, HCC, and liver-related mortality or liver transplant in patients with baseline compensated cirrhosis. We conducted a single-center retrospective study of patients in the Michigan Genomics Initiative who underwent genotyping. The primary predictors were PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and HSD17B13 genotypes. Primary outcomes were either hepatic decompensation, HCC, or liver-related mortality/transplant. We conducted competing risk Fine-Gray analyses on our cohort. We identified 732 patients with baseline compensated cirrhosis. During follow-up, 50% of patients developed decompensation, 13% developed HCC, 24% underwent liver transplant, and 27% died. PNPLA3-rs738409-G genotype was associated with risk of incident HCC: adjusted subhazard hazard ratio 2.42 (1.40-4.17), p=0.0015 for PNPLA3-rs738409-GG vs. PNPLA3-rs738409-CC genotype. The 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC was higher in PNPLA3-rs738409-GG carriers than PNPLA3-rs738409-CC/-CG carriers: 15.6% (9.0%-24.0%) vs. 7.4% (5.2%-10.0%), p<0.001. PNPLA3 genotype was not associated with decompensation or the combined outcome of liver-related mortality or liver transplant. TM6SF2 and HSD17B13 genotypes were not associated with decompensation or HCC.

The effectiveness and safety of thermal ablation for thyroid carcinoma lymph node metastasis are affected by the diameter of metastatic lymph nodes: A meta-analysis.,"To explore the diameter of lymph nodes with metastatic thyroid carcinoma and the effectiveness and safety of thermal ablation. Several databases were searched for literature on the treatment of thyroid carcinoma metastatic lymph nodes by thermal ablation. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the diameter of the metastatic lymph nodes. The measures included pooled estimates of mean volume reduction, pooled proportions of total disappearance and recurrence, and the pooled proportions of overall complications. There were 20 studies with 372 patients and 620 metastatic lymph nodes included. Based on the average maximum diameter of the metastatic lymph nodes, they were divided into three groups: A (≤ 10 mm), B (10 < diameter ≤ 20 mm), and C (> 20 mm). The study results indicated a significant decrease in the average volume only in groups A and B. The ratio of tumor disappearance showed that group A had the highest percentage, followed by group B and then group C. The recurrence rates were comparable between groups A and B, but slightly lower than in group C. Moreover, the overall complication rates for the three groups were ranked as follows: group A > group C > group B.

Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure.,"Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. This Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of intravenous loop diuretics strategies in treating AHF in individuals with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload. To assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults. We identified trials through systematic searches of bibliographic databases and in clinical trials registers including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CPCI-S on the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), and the European Union Trials register. We conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was performed on 29 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with AHF, NYHA classification III or IV, regardless of aetiology or ejection fraction, where trials compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in AHF. We excluded trials with chronic stable heart failure, cardiogenic shock, renal artery stenosis, or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we excluded studies combining loop diuretics with hypertonic saline, inotropes, vasoactive medications, or renal replacement therapy and trials where diuretic dosing was protocol-driven to achieve a target urine output, due to confounding factors. Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion and reviewed full-texts. Outcomes included weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission following discharge, and occurrence of acute kidney injury. We performed risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis where data permitted and assessed certainty of the evidence. The review included seven RCTs, spanning 32 hospitals in seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from eight months to six years. Following exclusion of participants in subgroups with confounding treatments and different clinical settings, 681 participants were eligible for review. These additional study characteristics, coupled with our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the applicability of the body of the evidence as they reflect real-world clinical practice. Meta-analysis was feasible for net weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Literature review and narrative analysis explored daily fluid balance; cardiovascular mortality; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) change; N-terminal-proBNP change; and adverse incidents such as ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Risk of bias assessment revealed two studies with low overall risk, four with some concerns, and one with high risk. All sensitivity analyses excluded trials at high risk of bias. Only narrative analysis was conducted for 'daily fluid balance' due to diverse data presentation methods across two studies (169 participants, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect). Results of narrative analysis varied. For instance, one study reported higher daily fluid balance within the first 24 hours in the continuous infusion group compared to the bolus injection group, whereas there was no difference in fluid balance beyond this time point. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 21%; very low-certainty evidence). Importantly, sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high risk of bias showed there was insufficient evidence for a difference in bodyweight loss between groups (MD 0.70 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.46; 3 trials, 378 participants; P = 0.07, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I<sup>2</sup> = 4%; low-certainty evidence). Despite sensitivity analysis, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -4.84 to 2.64; 4 trials, 211 participants; P = 0.57, I<sup>2</sup> = 88%; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis improved heterogeneity; however, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 3 trials, 400 participants; P = 0.31, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show insufficient evidence for a difference in the readmission to hospital between groups. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.49; 3 trials, 491 participants; P = 0.92, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show that continuous infusion may make little to no difference on the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse events compared to the bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics. Analysis of available data comparing two delivery methods of diuretics in acute heart failure found that the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other. Our findings were based on trials meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure validity. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.",['Rasoul D; Zhang J; Farnell E; Tsangarides AA; Chong SC; Fernando R; Zhou C; Ihsan M; Ahmed S; Lwin TS; Bateman J; Hill RA; Lip GY; Sankaranarayanan R'],2024,"acute heart failure is new onset of, or sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure. treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. trials compared intravenous continuous infusion with bolus injection."
Distribution of Traditional Chinese Medicine syndromes in diabetic kidney disease chronic kidney disease 1-5: a correlation study.,"To analyze the distribution of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and its related factors. We enrolled 435 patients with DKD, who were not undergoing dialysis, admitted to the Department of Nephrology, First Medical Center, Chinese PLA General Hospital from April 2020 to August 2021. Analysis of their TCM syndromes and related factors was carried out. The 435 patients included 109, 117, 86, and 123 chronic kidney disease (CKD) 1-2, CKD3, CKD4, and CKD5 cases, respectively. With the progression of CKD1-5, the proportion of <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome, and that of <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome showed a downward trend, whereas the proportion of spleen-kidney <i>Yang</i> deficiency, blood deficiency, blood stasis, water stagnation, and phlegm turbidity syndromes showed an upward trend; the differences were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that <i>Yin</i> deficiency and dry heat syndrome was positively correlated with hemoglobin [odds ratio (<i>OR</i>) = 1.022, <i>P</i> = 0.005], albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.058, <i>P =</i> 0.006), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (<i>OR</i> = 1.020, <i>P <</i> 0.001) but negatively correlated with male sex (<i>OR</i> = 0.277, <i>P =</i> 0.004). <i>Qi</i> and <i>Yin</i> deficiency syndrome was positively correlated with albumin (<i>OR</i> = 1.056, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and eGFR (<i>OR</i> = 1.008, <i>P</i> = 0.022) but negatively correlated with age (<i>OR</i> = 0.977, <i>P</i> = 0.023).

Development and validation of a deep-learning model to predict 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk from retinal images using the UK Biobank and EyePACS 10K datasets.,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of death globally, and early detection of high-risk individuals is essential for initiating timely interventions. The authors aimed to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model to predict an individual's elevated 10-year ASCVD risk score based on retinal images and limited demographic data. The study used 89,894 retinal fundus images from 44,176 UK Biobank participants (96% non-Hispanic White, 5% diabetic) to train and test the DL model. The DL model was developed using retinal images plus age, race/ethnicity, and sex at birth to predict an individual's 10-year ASCVD risk score using the pooled cohort equation (PCE) as the ground truth. This model was then tested on the US EyePACS 10K dataset (5.8% non-Hispanic White, 99.9% diabetic), composed of 18,900 images from 8969 diabetic individuals. Elevated ASCVD risk was defined as a PCE score of ≥7.5%. In the UK Biobank internal validation dataset, the DL model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, sensitivity 84%, and specificity 90%, for detecting individuals with elevated ASCVD risk scores. In the EyePACS 10K and with the addition of a regression-derived diabetes modifier, it achieved sensitivity 94%, specificity 72%, mean error -0.2%, and mean absolute error 3.1%. This study demonstrates that DL models using retinal images can provide an additional approach to estimating ASCVD risk, as well as the value of applying DL models to different external datasets and opportunities about ASCVD risk assessment in patients living with diabetes.",['Vaghefi E; Squirrell D; Yang S; An S; Xie L; Durbin MK; Hou H; Marshall J; Shreibati J; McConnell MV; Budoff M'],2024,"a deep learning model was developed using retinal images plus age, race/ethnicity, and sex at birth to predict an individual's 10-year ASCVD risk score. the DL model was then tested on the US EyePACS 10K dataset (5.8% non-Hispanic White, 99.9% diabetic), composed of 18,900 images from 8969 diabetic individuals."
Impact of Primary Care Providers and Health Insurance Type on Colorectal Cancer Screening in the United States.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer deaths.

Modern-Day Therapeutics and Ongoing Clinical Trials against Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Narrative Review.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a global health concern that affects millions of people globally. The present review aims to narrate the clinical guidelines and therapeutic interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients. Furthermore, the present work summarizes the ongoing phase 1/2/3 and clinical trials against T2DM. A meticulous and comprehensive literature review was performed using various databases, such as PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical trials database (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), and Google Scholar, to include various clinical trials and therapeutic interventions against T2DM. Based on our findings, we concluded that most T2DM-associated clinical trials are interventional. Anti-diabetic therapeutics, including insulin, metformin, Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs), and Sodium- Glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are frontline therapeutics being clinically investigated. Currently, the therapeutics in phase IV clinical trials are mostly SGLT-2 inhibitors, implicating their critical contribution to the clinical management of T2DM. Despite the success of T2DM treatments, a surge in innovative treatment options to reduce diabetic consequences and improve glycemic control is currently ongoing. More emphasis needs to be on exploring novel targeted drug candidates that can offer more sustained glycemic control.",['Tiwari RK; Ahmad A; Chadha M; Saha K; Verma H; Borgohain K; Shukla R'],2024,the present review aims to narrate the clinical guidelines and therapeutic interventions for Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients. the present work summarizes the ongoing phase 1/2/3 and clinical trials against T2DM.
Ethnicity-related differences in mitochondrial regulation by insulin stimulation in diabetes.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in the development of insulin resistance, which is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. However, recent studies reveal ethnicity-related differences in mitochondrial processes, underscoring the need for nuance in studying mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes among African Americans and individuals of African descent has brought attention to the role of ethnicity in disease susceptibility. In this review, which covers existing literature, genetic studies, and clinical data, we aim to elucidate the complex relationship between mitochondrial alterations and insulin stimulation by considering how mitochondrial dynamics, contact sites, pathways, and metabolomics may be differentially regulated across ethnicities, through mechanisms such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition to achieving a better understanding of insulin stimulation, future studies identifying novel regulators of mitochondrial structure and function could provide valuable insights into ethnicity-dependent insulin signaling and personalized care.",['Neikirk K; Kabugi K; Mungai M; Kula B; Smith N; Hinton AO'],2024,study aims to elucidate the complex relationship between mitochondrial alterations and insulin stimulation. ethnicity-related differences in mitochondrial processes have been highlighted.
Metformin-induced changes of the gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: results from a prospective cohort study.,"The influence of the microbiota on hypoglycemic agents is becoming more apparent. The effects of metformin, a primary anti-diabetes drug, on gut microbiota are still not fully understood. This prospective cohort study aims to investigate the longitudinal effects of metformin on the gut microbiota of 25 treatment-naïve diabetes patients, each receiving a daily dose of 1500 mg. Microbiota compositions were analyzed at baseline, and at 1, 3, and 6 months of medication using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Prior to the 3-month period of metformin treatment, significant improvements were noted in body mass index (BMI) and glycemic-related parameters, such as fasting blood glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), alongside homeostasis model assessment indices of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). At the 3-month mark of medication, a significant reduction in the α-diversity of the gut microbiota was noted, while β-diversity exhibited no marked variances throughout the treatment duration. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. markedly decreased. Metformin treatment consistently increased Escherichia-Shigella and decreased Romboutsia, while Pseudomonas decreased at 3 months. Fuzzy c-means clustering identified three longitudinal trajectory clusters for microbial fluctuations: (i) genera temporarily changing, (ii) genera continuing to decrease (Bacteroides), and (iii) genera continuing to increase(Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group, [Eubacterium] xylanophilum group, Romboutsia, Faecalibacterium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-014). The correlation matrix revealed associations between specific fecal taxa and metformin-related clinical parameters HbA1c, FPG, Uric Acid (UA), high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), triglyceride (TG) (P < 0.05). Metacyc database showed that metformin significantly altered 17 functional pathways. Amino acid metabolism pathways such as isoleucine biosynthesis predominated in the post-treatment group. Metformin's role in glucose metabolism regulation may primarily involve specific alterations in certain gut microbial species rather than an overall increase in microbial species diversity. This may suggest gut microbiota targets in future studies on metabolic abnormalities caused by metformin.",['Gao Y; Zhao T; Lv N; Liu S; Yuan T; Fu Y; Zhao W; Zhu B'],2024,metformin is a primary anti-diabetes drug. it is a primary anti-diabetes drug. the effects of the drug on gut microbiota are still not fully understood.
Management and Long-Term Outcomes of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DReSS) in Children: A Scoping Review.,"Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DReSS) is known to cause mortality and long-term sequelae in the pediatric population, however there are no established clinical practice guidelines for the management of pediatric DReSS. We conducted a scoping review, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to summarize the currently available data on treatment, mortality, and long-term sequelae of DReSS in children (aged 0-18 years). Data from 644 individuals revealed that various treatment strategies are being used in the management of pediatric DReSS, and strategies were often used in combination. The diversity in treatment approaches cannot be solely attributed to age or disease severity and reflects the lack of evidence-based management guidelines for DReSS. Children are also at risk of developing autoimmune sequelae following DReSS, most commonly thyroid disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus. We found that the eventual development of autoimmune disease was more often associated with DReSS caused by antibiotics, especially minocycline and sulfamethoxazole, in comparison with individuals who did not develop sequelae. In this study, we identify strengths and weaknesses in the currently available literature and highlight that future prospective studies with structured and long-term follow-up of children with DReSS are needed to better understand potential risk factors for mortality and development of sequelae after DReSS.",['Cherepacha N; St George-Hyslop F; Chugani B; Alabdeen Y; Sanchez-Espino LF; Mahood Q; Sibbald C; Verstegen RHJ'],2024,"a scoping review was conducted to summarize the currently available data on treatment, mortality, and long-term sequelae of DReSS in children (aged 0-18 years) the diversity in treatment approaches cannot be solely attributed to age or disease severity."

Integrating Omics into Functional Biomarkers of Type 1 Diabetes.,"Biomarkers are critical to the staging and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Functional biomarkers offer insights into T1D immunopathogenesis and are often revealed using ""omics"" approaches that integrate multiple measures to identify involved pathways and functions. Application of the omics biomarker discovery may enable personalized medicine approaches to circumvent the more recently appreciated heterogeneity of T1D progression and treatment. Use of omics to define functional biomarkers is still in its early years, yet findings to date emphasize the role of cytokine signaling and adaptive immunity in biomarkers of progression and response to therapy. Here, we share examples of the use of omics to define functional biomarkers focusing on two signatures, T-cell exhaustion and T-cell help, which have been associated with outcomes in both the natural history and treatment contexts.",['Long SA; Linsley PS'],2024,"biomarkers are critical to the staging and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. functional biomarkers are often revealed using ""omics"" approaches. omics biomarker discovery may enable personalized medicine approaches."
An indocyanine green fluorescence-guided operation for diagnosing and treating pleuroperitoneal communication.,"Pleuroperitoneal communication occurs when ascites moves from the abdominal cavity to the pleural cavity via a diaphragmatic fistula. Managing large pleural fluid volumes is challenging, often requiring an operation. Identifying small diaphragmatic fistulas during the operation can be problematic, but ensuring their detection improves outcomes. This video tutorial presents a recent empirical case in which we successfully identified and closed a pleuroperitoneal contact using a thoracoscopic surgical procedure aided by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. The patient, a 66-year-old woman, was hospitalized due to acute dyspnoea from a right thoracic pleural effusion during hepatic ascites treatment for cirrhosis. Because ascites decreased with pleural fluid drainage, surgical intervention was considered due to suspicion of a pleuroperitoneal connection. During the operation, indocyanine green was injected intraperitoneally, and near-infrared fluorescence-guided thoracoscopy pinpointed the location of the diaphragmatic fistula. The fistula was sutured and reinforced with a polyglycolic acid sheet and fibrin glue. Detecting the fistula intraoperatively is crucial to prevent recurrence, and the indocyanine green fluorescence method is a safe and effective technique for detecting small fistulas.",['Takeda T; Watanabe Y; Sato K; Numakura T; Onodera K; Notsuda H; Niikawa H; Okada Y'],2024,a patient was hospitalized due to acute dyspnoea from a right thoracic pleural effusion during hepatic ascites treatment for cirrhosis. a thoracoscopic surgical procedure aided by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. the fistula was sutured and reinforced with a polyglycolic acid sheet and fibrin glue.

One hundred twenty-three (n = 123) women with FMS completed demographic (age, height, weight), clinical (years with pain, intensity of pain at rest and during daily living activities), functional (quality of life, physical function), sensory-related (sensitization-associated and neuropathic-associated symptoms), psychophysical (pressure pain thresholds), psychological (sleep quality, depressive and anxiety level) and cognitive (pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia) variables. Those three genotypes of the OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 and COMT rs4680 single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained by polymerase chain reactions from no-stimulated whole saliva collection. No significant differences in demographic, clinical, functional, sensory-related, psychophysical, psychological and cognitive variables according to OPRM1 rs1799971, HTR1B rs6296 or COMT rs4680 genotype were identified in our sample of women with FMS.

Emerging therapies in Ewing sarcoma.,"There is an unmet need to improve outcomes for patients for Ewing sarcoma, a rare, aggressive sarcoma with a peak incidence in adolescents and young adults (AYA). Current therapy at diagnosis involves multiagent chemotherapy and local therapy, but despite intensification of treatment, those with metastases at diagnosis and recurrent disease have poor outcomes. Improved understanding of Ewing sarcoma biology has identified novel targets with promising activity in Ewing sarcoma patients, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are now undergoing evaluation as combination and maintenance therapy. Other emerging therapies include those that target the EWSR1::FLI1 fusion oncoprotein, and act on DNA damage, cell cycle and apoptotic pathways. Immunotherapeutic approaches, particularly CAR-T-cell therapy directed at GD2, also hold promise. Recent collaborative clinical trials that have defined an international standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma and novel platform studies with adaptive designs offer unique opportunities to investigate these therapies inclusive of all ages. Close international collaboration between clinicians and biologists will allow us to prioritize promising emerging therapies and develop biomarkers to facilitate their incorporation into standard of care and more rapidly translate into benefit for Ewing sarcoma patients.",['Strauss SJ; Berlanga P; McCabe MG'],2024,"new therapies target the EWSR1::FLI1 fusion oncoprotein. other emerging therapies include those that act on DNA damage, cell cycle and apoptotic pathways."
Autoimmune conditions and gastric cancer risk in a population-based study in the United Kingdom.,"Although overall incidence of gastric cancer is decreasing, incidence has been increasing among young people in some Western countries. This trend may stem from the increase in autoimmune conditions. A nested case-control study of gastric cancer in UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Up to ten cancer-free controls were matched to cases by age and sex. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between analyzable autoimmune conditions (n = 34) and gastric cancer with Bonferroni correction. We evaluated associations between pernicious anaemia and other conditions. A meta-analysis of published prospective studies and ours was conducted. Among 6586 cases (1156 cardia, 1104 non-cardia, and 4334 overlapping/unspecified tumours) and 65,687 controls, any autoimmune condition was associated with gastric cancer (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.20). Individuals with pernicious anaemia had higher gastric cancer risk than those without (OR = 2.75; 2.19-3.44). Among controls, pernicious anaemia was associated with seven other conditions (OR range: 2.21-29.80). The pooled estimate for any autoimmune condition and gastric cancer was 1.17 (1.14-1.21; n = 47,126 cases). Autoimmunity increases gastric cancer risk.

Paclitaxel Overload Supramolecular Oxidative Stress Nanoamplifier with a CDK12 Inhibitor for Enhanced Cancer Therapy.,"Combination therapy has emerged as a promising approach for treating tumors, although there is room for improvement. This study introduced a novel strategy that combined the enhancement of apoptosis, ferroptosis, and DNA damage to improve therapeutic outcomes for prostate cancer. Specifically, we have developed a supramolecular oxidative stress nanoamplifier, which was comprised of β-cyclodextrin, paclitaxel, and ferrocene-poly(ethylene glycol). Paclitaxel within the system disrupted microtubule dynamics, inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Concurrently, ferrocene utilized hydrogen peroxide to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals in cells through the Fenton reaction, triggering a cascade of reactive oxygen species expansion, reduction of glutathione levels, lipid peroxidation, and ferroptosis. The increased number of hydroxyl radicals and the inhibitory effect of THZ531 on DNA repair mechanisms exacerbated DNA damage within tumor cells. As expected, the supramolecular nanoparticles demonstrated excellent drug delivery ability to tumor cells or tissues, exhibited favorable biological safety <i>in vivo</i>, and enhanced the killing effect on prostate cancer.",['Zhang H; Xing C; Yan B; Lei H; Guan Y; Zhang S; Kang Y; Pang J'],2024,"a new strategy has emerged as a promising approach for treating prostate cancer. the supramolecular oxidative stress nanoamplifier was comprised of -cyclodextrin, paclitaxel, and ferrocene-poly(ethylene glycol) the system disrupted microtubule dynamics, inducing G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis."
Estrogen Receptor Is Required for Metformin-Induced Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cells Under Hyperglycemic Conditions.,"About 25% to 30% of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients develop resistance to endocrine therapy. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has been shown to cooperate with several growth factors that regulate cellular energy metabolism, including the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). As the first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, metformin is widely known to inhibit the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. This study aims to investigate metformin's efficacy in inhibiting endocrine resistance related to genes regulating energy metabolism in both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines under hyperglycemic conditions. MDA-MB-361 (ER-positive, HER2-positive) and SKBR3 (ER-negative, HER2-positive) cancer cell lines were used to represent ER status. Cell viability and cell survival rate were measured using the colorimetric assay of Cell Counting Kit-8. All mRNA levels were quantified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction preceded by reverse transcription. A <i>P</i> value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. Unlike MDA-MB-361, SKBR3 were found to acquire resistance upon metformin treatment in hyperglycemic conditions. Moreover, the mRNA expression of IGF-1R and its downstream signaling, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), was not affected by metformin. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression level of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) was upregulated, whereas forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) was downregulated after metformin treatment in hyperglycemic conditions. This preliminary study suggests that an alternative pathway of metformin resistance may exist in the absence of ERα. Therefore, relying solely on metformin may be inadequate to inhibit the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells.",['Sekar AP; Nurmala S; Matsuura E; Tan XW; Rahmasari R; Sauriasari R'],2024,metformin is widely known to inhibit the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. a mRNA expression of IGF-1R and its downstream signaling was not affected.
Glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonism and attempted suicide: A Mendelian randomisation study to assess a potential causal association.,"Glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have transformed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity management. Multiple regulatory agencies are investigating reported associations between GLP1-RA and increased suicide attempts (SA), but observational data may be prone to confounding. Randomised control trials (RCT) of GLP-1RA were largely undertaken in people at lower risk of SA. Real-world data suggest semaglutide use associates with reduced suicidal ideation and depression but was under-powered to statistically assess risk of SA. Mendelian randomisation (MR) leverages genetic instrument(s) to infer potential causal association between an exposure and an outcome. We undertook MR using missense variants in the gene encoding GLP1R that improve glycemia, lower T2D risk and/or lower BMI, to investigate potential causal association between GLP-1RA and SA. In people of European ancestry, MR did not find evidence genetically proxied GLP1RA increased SA in a general population cohort: (rs10305492, exposure: HbA1c, odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38, 0.41-4.62, p = .60), (rs10305492, exposure: FG, OR 1.27, 0.52-3.13, p = .60) and (rs1042044, exposure BMI, OR 0.30, 0.06-1.48) with concordant results in a multi-ancestry SA case-control cohort.

Intracystic gastrointestinal stromal tumor developed in the round ligament of the liver.,"A 44-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for the examination and treatment of a presumed gallbladder tumor. Both ultrasound and computed tomography showed an intracystic tumor but failed to point out the discontinuity between the cystic lesion and the gallbladder. Magnetic resonance imaging, however, could clearly depict the presumed intracystic tumor and the discontinuity between the gallbladder and the target lesion. Both contents of the gallbladder and the cystic lesion showed hypo and hyper intense patterns, though both with slightly different intensities, on T1- and T2-weighted images, respectively. Under the preoperative diagnosis of early gallbladder cancer despite these image findings, laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted to the patient. Laparoscopic observation, however, revealed that the target lesion was not continuous with the gallbladder and was located in the round ligament of the liver. Intraoperative findings led us to do cholecystectomy and resection of the adjacent cystic tumor. The intracystic tumor was 3 cm in size and had minute solid component inside the cyst wall. Pathological study of the presumed gallbladder cancer showed epithelioid cells and spindle cells growing in sheet like and storiform fashions, respectively. Cystic walls mainly consisted of hypo cellular fibrous components. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor was positive for CD117 and negative both for desmin and S100, leading to the diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

Translation and validation of the Chinese version of the BCPT Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) in patients with breast cancer.,"This study aimed to translate the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) into Chinese and subsequently examine the latent constructs and psychometric properties of the Chinese BESS (C-BESS) among patients with breast cancer. In Phase 1, the BESS was translated from English into Chinese using the FACIT translation method. An expert panel was convened to assess the content validity, and pilot testing was performed with 20 patients with breast cancer. In Phase 2, a total of 427 patients with breast cancer from four Grade-A public hospitals in China were recruited to examine psychometric properties of the C-BESS. The internal consistency was evaluated based on the Cronbach's α, and the construct validity was tested using confirmatory factor analysis, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. The C-BESS demonstrated satisfactory content validity index (item-level content validity index [I-CVI]: 0.8-1.0; scale-level content validity index [S-CVI]: 0.97). The Cronbach's α value for the entire C-BESS scale was 0.92. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that eight-factor structure of the C-BESS was a good fit to the data (CFI = 0.959, AGFI = 0.904, RMSEA = 0.05, RMR = 0.029). The scale exhibited good convergent validity and discriminant validity. This study translated and validated the C-BESS for use in the Chinese population. The results demonstrate that the C-BESS exhibits good reliability and validity, with ideal psychometric properties for assessing the symptom burden in Chinese patients with breast cancer.

Exploring the L-shaped relationship between Atherogenic Index of Plasma and depression: Results from NHANES 2005-2018.,"The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) is a novel metric linked to several diseases. However, there is inadequate evidence to investigate the relationship between AIP and depression. Therefore, we aim to elucidate the non-linear association between AIP and depression. 12,453 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018 were included. The AIP was calculated as log10 (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to identify depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10). Weighted multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS) models, subgroup analysis, and interaction tests were employed to reveal the relationship between AIP and depression. AIP was found to be significantly correlated with depression. In the fully adjusted model, elevated AIP levels were associated with higher odds of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50; 95 % CI: 1.06-2.12). The RCS analysis indicated an L-shaped pattern in the relationship between depression and AIP, with inflection points at -0.289. Beyond this inflection point, individuals with elevated AIP levels were associated with higher odds of depression (OR = 2.25; 95 % CI: 1.49-3.39). Notably, the association was particularly pronounced among individuals with diabetes. This cross-sectional study is unable to establish causal relationships. There was an L-shaped association between AIP and depression among US adults.

SGLT2 inhibitors protect patients with T2DM from cardiovascular complications and are generally safe. <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study is to assess the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic review was conducted using published English literature in PubMed and Google Scholar databases. <b>Results:</b> Most of the studies showed significant positive cardiovascular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD). Empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), cardiovascular death or heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death regardless of the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) were assessed. Further, the efficacy of empagliflozin in three different phenotypic groups, namely, younger patients with shorter duration of T2DM and highest glomerular filtration rate, women without coronary artery disease, and older adults with advanced coronary artery disease plus several comorbidities, was also assessed. The effects of canagliflozin were evaluated in patients with and without a history of CVD and with different body weights, and in those with and without prior heart failure. Treatment with canagliflozin based on multivariable-predicted cardiovascular risk factors prevented heart failure events more than treatment based on glycated hemoglobin and albuminuria alone. The efficacy of dapagliflozin was evaluated in patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure status, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), as well as the elderly population. A reduction in HHF or cardiovascular death and insignificant reduction in MACE were noted. Furthermore, significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) was also observed. Sotagliflozin was studied for its cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease with or without albuminuria and resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths and HHF. <b>Conclusion:</b> SGLT2 inhibitors have beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with T2DM and should be incorporated into their management.",['Yankah RK; Anku EK; Eligar V'],2024,SGLT2 inhibitors protect patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Frequency and Causes of Nocturnal Alarms in Youth and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Using a First-Generation Hybrid Closed-Loop System.,"Meeting glycemic recommendations is challenging for youth with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes technology, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and hybrid closed-loop (HCL) automated insulin delivery systems, significantly increase achievement of glycemic targets; however, many youth struggle to sustain use of early HCL systems. Nocturnal alarm fatigue contributes to disrupted sleep and device discontinuation. We examined the frequency and causes of nocturnal (10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) alarms in pediatric patients (<i>N</i> = 76, median age 14.5 years [interquartile range 11.8-17.0 years, range 7-24 years]) starting on a first-generation HCL system in a prospective observational study. Device data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models to examine change across time at 3-month intervals for 12 months. At baseline (HCL system in nonautomated mode), participants averaged 3.3 ± 0.6 alarms per night. In the 2 weeks after starting HCL (automated) mode, alarm frequency significantly increased to 5.4 ± 0.5 times per night (<i>P</i> <0.001). Alarm frequency decreased through the remainder of the observational period; however, CGM sensor and HCL system use also declined. The types of alarms were evenly distributed among sensor maintenance, sensor threshold, pump, and HCL-specific alarms. These data show that HCL system nocturnal alarms are frequent and may be barriers to sleep quality and device use. Further research is needed to assess the impact of diabetes technology on sleep and to determine method to improve sleep quality with technology use.",['Cobry EC; Vigers T; Berget C; Messer LH; Wadwa RP; Pyle L; Forlenza GP'],2024,"diabetes technology, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and hybrid closed-loop (HCL) automated insulin delivery systems, significantly increase achievement of glycemic targets. many youth struggle to sustain use of early HCL systems."
Exploring traditional and modern approaches for extracting bioactive compounds from <i>Ferulago trachycarpa</i>.,"For more than two millennia, <i>Ferulago</i> species have been revered as therapeutic herbs, maintaining their significance in present-day folk medicine practices. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the phytochemical composition, inhibitory effects on metabolic enzymes, and possible therapeutic applications of <i>F. trachycarpa</i>, specifically focusing on its efficacy in diabetes management, anticholinergic effects, and antioxidant capabilities. The current investigation comprised an evaluation of a range of extracts acquired via conventional and modern methodologies, such as soxhlet (SOX), maceration (MAC) accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), homogenizer-assisted extraction (HAE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), microwave-assisted extraction (MW), and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). Various techniques were employed to assess their antioxidant capacity and enzyme inhibition. Furthermore, the research utilized ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS (UHPLC-MS/MS) to ascertain the principal phenolic compounds that are responsible for the antioxidant capacity observed in the various <i>F. trachycarpa</i> extracts. Among these, extracts from HAE, ASE, and MW revealed the most promise across all methodologies tested for their antioxidant potential.

Overview on incidence, symptoms, diagnostics, grading, imaging and prognostic determinants, including factors having an impact on therapeutic management. Review on current literature, including original articles, reviews, guidelines and expert opinions. NEN are mainly located in the gastrointestinal tract and their incidence has increased in recent years, mainly due to improved diagnostics, e.g., cross-sectional imaging. Clinical characteristics include hormone excess syndromes (carcinoid syndrome). Laboratory markers such as chromogranin A are commonly used as part of routine diagnostics, followed by endoscopic and endosonographic procedures, which also allow biopsies to be obtained. Tumor spread can be determined by contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) or somatostatin receptor (SSRT)-PET/CT (positron emission tomography). Prognostic factors include Ki67 index, type, and grading. Resection with curative intent is the therapy of choice. In a metastasized setting, SSRT-directed treatment approaches are favored, while in dedifferentiated NEN, conventional chemotherapy is needed. A broad diagnostic armamentarium can be offered to NEN patients and the improved diagnostic procedures have most likely caused a raising incidence in recent years.

BET inhibition reforms the immune microenvironment and alleviates T cell dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Redundant tumor microenvironment (TME) immunosuppressive mechanisms and epigenetic maintenance of terminal T cell exhaustion greatly hinder functional antitumor immune responses in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins regulate key pathways contributing to CLL pathogenesis and TME interactions, including T cell function and differentiation. Herein, we report that blocking BET protein function alleviates immunosuppressive networks in the CLL TME and repairs inherent CLL T cell defects. The pan-BET inhibitor OPN-51107 reduced exhaustion-associated cell signatures resulting in improved T cell proliferation and effector function in the Eμ-TCL1 splenic TME. Following BET inhibition (BET-i), TME T cells coexpressed significantly fewer inhibitory receptors (IRs) (e.g., PD-1, CD160, CD244, LAG3, VISTA). Complementary results were witnessed in primary CLL cultures, wherein OPN-51107 exerted proinflammatory effects on T cells, regardless of leukemic cell burden. BET-i additionally promotes a progenitor T cell phenotype through reduced expression of transcription factors that maintain terminal differentiation and increased expression of TCF-1, at least in part through altered chromatin accessibility. Moreover, direct T cell effects of BET-i were unmatched by common targeted therapies in CLL. This study demonstrates the immunomodulatory action of BET-i on CLL T cells and supports the inclusion of BET inhibitors in the management of CLL to alleviate terminal T cell dysfunction and potentially enhance tumoricidal T cell activity.","[""Smith AL; Skupa SA; Eiken AP; Reznicek TE; Schmitz E; Williams N; Moore DY; D'Angelo CR; Kallam A; Lunning MA; Bociek RG; Vose JM; Mohamed E; Mahr AR; Denton PW; Powell B; Bollag G; Rowley MJ; El-Gamal D""]",2024,a pan-BET inhibitor reduced exhaustion-associated cell signatures. the pan-BET inhibitor OPN-51107 reduced exhaustion-associated cell signatures. this reduced exhaustion-associated cell signatures resulting in improved T cell proliferation and effector function in the splenic TME.
Evaluating adherence to American Diabetes Association standards of care in diabetes and impacts of social determinants of health on patients at two nurse practitioner-owned clinics.,"The COVID-19 pandemic created barriers in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and worsened social determinants of health (SDOH). A New Hampshire primary care office worked to adhere to T2DM standards of care and began screening for SDOH. This project assessed adherence to quality metrics, hemoglobin A1C, and SDOH screening as telehealth utilization decreased. A1C values have increased at the practice, especially since COVID-19. The practice also began screening for SDOH at every visit, but there was need to assess how needs were being documented and if/how they were addressed. A retrospective chart review of patients with T2DM was performed. Demographic data and T2DM metrics were collected and compared with previous years and compared new versus established patients. Charts were reviewed to evaluate documentation of SDOH and appropriate referral. The practice transitioned from an increased utliization of telehealth back to prioritizing in-office visits. The practice also began routinely screening for SDOH in 2020; however, this process had not been standardized or evaluated. Adherence to nearly all quality metrics improved. Glycemic control improved after a year of nurse practitioner (NP) care, especially in new patients. All patients were screened for SDOH, but documentation varied, and affected patients had higher A1Cs, despite receiving comparable care. Nurse practitioners at this practice are adhering to American Diabetes Association guidelines, and A1C values improve under their care.

"Effectiveness of the socioecological informed contextual treatment summary and care plan (TSSCP-P, Brazil) for breast cancer survivors: a randomized, controlled study.","This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an intervention using the Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan (TSSCP-P) on self-efficacy and quality of life (QoL) in breast cancer survivors. A clinical study, randomized and controlled, conducted to assess self-efficacy and QOL in breast cancer survivors. The participants were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group received individualized nursing consultations guided by the TSSCP-P, while the control group received standard care. Self-efficacy and QoL were assessed at three evaluation moments using validated scales: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Plus Anm Morbidity (FACT B + 4) and Perceived General Self-Efficacy Scale. Statistical analyses, including regression analysis and hypothesis tests, were conducted to examine the effects of the intervention on self-efficacy and QoL. Female breast cancer survivors (N = 101) were recruited. The intervention group demonstrated a significant improvement in self-efficacy over time compared to the control group (p = 0.01). However, no significant differences were observed in the overall QoL scores between the two groups. Subscale analysis revealed a significant improvement in physical well-being for the intervention group (p = 0.04), while emotional well-being showed a non-significant improvement (p = 0.07). The study suggests that individualized care plans and support strategies, such as the TSSCP-P, can positively influence breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy and certain aspects of their QoL. These findings highlight the potential benefits of the TSSCP-P intervention in enhancing self-efficacy among breast cancer survivors. However, further research is needed to explore its impact on overall QoL and its effectiveness across different stages of breast cancer, as well as with longer follow-up periods.

Therefore, a bibliometric analysis was performed to describe the bibliometric indicators of publications evaluating the relationship between TB and DM2. A descriptive and observational bibliometric study was conducted using the Scopus database to identify documents published from 2016-2023, for which free and controlled terms (Medical subject headings and Emtree) were used. The variables collected comprised the number of published documents, institutions, countries, authors, journals, and type of collaboration, which were exported to Excel 2016 and analyzed with SciVal. A total of 456 documents, 1624 authors, and 2173 citations were identified, with Medicine and Immunology-Microbiology being the subcategories with the highest and lowest number of documents (367 and 80 documents), respectively, with a strong decreasing trend correlation (R2: 0.95; P < 0.5) between the number and year of publication. While the country with the highest production was China (71 papers), the country with the highest citation was the United States (952 citations). In terms of authors, the highest production was by the American Venketaraman, and the highest impact was by the Asian Kimberly To. The institution with the highest number of papers was the Western University of Health Sciences, while Stellenbosch had the highest impact. Although the scientific productivity of DM2 and TB have reported growth rates of 158.75% and 7.3%, respectively, our results found a decreasing trend in publications associating these two diseases.

Clonal evolution and relapse in early-stage follicular lymphoma - a tree with many branches<sup>†</sup>.,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent B-cell neoplasm characterised by multistep evolution from premalignant precursor cells carrying the hallmark t(14;18) translocation in the majority of cases. In a new article in The Journal of Pathology, samples of relapsed early-stage FL - primary manifestation and relapse with or without transformation - initially treated with radiotherapy only, were studied for clonal relationships and evolution. Using somatic mutations and the rearranged immunoglobulin sequences as markers, the majority of paired lymphoma samples showed so-called branched evolution from a common, possibly premalignant progenitor cell, with both shared and private mutations. In addition, clonally unrelated cases were identified. This and previous studies with similar findings clearly document that relapse or transformation of FL in many instances not necessarily represents a linear progression of disease due to acquisition of additional mutations and therapy resistance, but rather new outgrowths derived from a pool of clonally related, long-lived, and low proliferating precursor cells, or even unrelated second neoplasms. © 2024 The Authors.

"Analysis of the effects of M2 macrophage-derived PDE4C on the prognosis, metastasis and immunotherapy benefit of osteosarcoma.","Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), encompassing M1 and M2 subtypes, exert significant effects on osteosarcoma (OS) progression and immunosuppression. However, the impacts of TAM-derived biomarkers on the progression of OS remains limited. The GSE162454 profile was subjected to single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing analysis to identify crucial mediators between TAMs and OS cells. The clinical features, effects and mechanisms of these mediators on OS cells and tumour microenvironment were evaluated via biological function experiments and molecular biology experiments. Phosphodiesterase 4C (PDE4C) was identified as a pivotal mediator in the communication between M2 macrophages and OS cells. Elevated levels of PDE4C were detected in OS tissues, concomitant with M2 macrophage level, unfavourable prognosis and metastasis. The expression of PDE4C was observed to increase during the conversion process of THP-1 cells to M2 macrophages, which transferred the PDE4C mRNA to OS cells through exosome approach. PDE4C increased OS cell proliferation and mobility via upregulating the expression of collagens. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between elevated levels of PDE4C and increased TIDE score, decreased response rate following immune checkpoint therapy, reduced TMB and diminished PDL1 expression. Collectively, PDE4C derived from M2 macrophages has the potential to enhance the proliferation and mobility of OS cells by augmenting collagen expression. PDE4C may serve as a valuable biomarker for prognosticating patient outcomes and response rates following immunotherapy.",['Pan F; Pan R; Hu R; Zhang H; Lei S; Zhang L; Zhou C; Zeng Z; Tian X; Xie Q'],2024,a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was conducted to identify key mediators between TAMs and OS cells. the effects of these mediators on OS cells and tumour microenvironment were limited. the effects of TAM-derived biomarkers on OS progression remain limited.
Discussions of Cancer Survivorship Care Needs: Are There Rural versus Urban Inequities?,"Rural cancer survivors may face greater challenges receiving survivorship care than urban cancer survivors. To test for rural versus urban inequities and identify other correlates of discussions about cancer survivorship care with healthcare professionals. Data are from the 2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), which included a cancer survivorship supplement. Adult survivors were asked if they discussed with a healthcare professional 5 components of survivorship care: need for follow-up services, lifestyle/health recommendations, emotional/social needs, long-term side effects, and a summary of treatments received. The Behavioral Model of Health Services guided the inclusion of predisposing, enabling, and need factors in ordered logit regression models of each survivorship care variable.

"Racial, Ethnic and Socioeconomic Diversity and Outcomes of Patients with Graft-versus-Host Disease: A CIBMTR Analysis.","Socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity have been associated with outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Certain aspects of GVHD management such as the need for long term care, prolonged immunosuppressive treatment, and need for close follow up for complications may exacerbate disparities. Adults (≥ 18 years) reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) who underwent a first alloHCT for acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasm between 2008 - 2018 were included. Endpoints for those developing GVHD included overall survival (OS), transplant related mortality (TRM), and disease relapse. Models were adjusted for patient and transplant related variables. A two-sided p-value < 0.01 was considered significant. Among the 14,825 allo-HCT recipients, 6,259 (42.2%) and 6,675 (45.0%) patients developed aGVHD and cGVHD, respectively.

Cytokine/Antibody Fusion Protein Design and Evaluation.,"Cytokines constitute a class of secreted proteins that activate transmembrane receptors to coordinate a vast array of physiological processes, particularly those related to immune activity. Due to their vital role in immune regulation, cytokines have garnered great interest as potential therapeutic agents. Unfortunately, the clinical success of cytokine drugs has been limited by their multifunctional activities, which hinder therapeutic performance and lead to harmful toxicities. In addition, the strikingly short circulation half-life of cytokines further hampers their efficacy as drugs. To overcome the translational challenges associated with natural cytokines, significant efforts have focused on engineering cytokines to target their activities and improve their pharmacological properties. One such strategy is the design of fusion proteins that tether a cytokine to an anti-cytokine antibody that selectively biases its functions and extends its serum half-life. These cytokine/antibody fusion proteins (termed immunocytokines) assemble intramolecularly to bias cytokine signaling behavior through multi-layered structural and molecular effects. Here, we present a detailed workflow for the design, production, and functional validation of intramolecularly assembled immunocytokines. In-depth procedures are presented for gene manipulation, mammalian cell-based expression and purification, binding analysis via bio-layer interferometry, and interrogation of cytokine signaling activity on human primary cells. In contrast with immunocytokines in which the tethered cytokine and antibody do not bind one another, intramolecularly assembled immunocytokines require special considerations with respect to their production to avoid oligomerization and/or aggregation.

Species-level identification of enterotype-specific microbial markers for colorectal cancer and adenoma.,"Enterotypes have been shown to be an important factor for population stratification based on gut microbiota composition, leading to a better understanding of human health and disease states. Classifications based on compositional patterns will have implications for personalized microbiota-based solutions. There have been limited enterotype based studies on colorectal adenoma and cancer. Here, an enterotype-based meta-analysis of fecal shotgun metagenomic studies was performed, including 1579 samples of healthy controls (CTR), colorectal adenoma (ADN) and colorectal cancer (CRC) in total. Gut microbiota of healthy people were clustered into three enterotypes (<i>Ruminococcus</i>-, <i>Bacteroides</i>- and <i>Prevotella</i>-dominated enterotypes). Reference-based enterotype assignments were performed for CRC and ADN samples, using the supervised machine learning algorithm, K-nearest neighbors. Differential abundance analyses and random forest classification were conducted on each enterotype between healthy controls and CRC-ADN groups, revealing novel enterotype-specific microbial markers for non-invasive CRC screening strategies. Furthermore, we identified microbial species unique to each enterotype that play a role in the production of secondary bile acids and short-chain fatty acids, unveiling the correlation between cancer-associated gut microbes and dietary patterns. The enterotype-based approach in this study is promising in elucidating the mechanisms of differential gut microbiome profiles, thereby improving the efficacy of personalized microbiota-based solutions.",['Güven Gülhan Ü; Nikerel E; Çakır T; Erdoğan Sevilgen F; Durmuş S'],2024,enterotypes have been shown to be an important factor for population stratification. study based on compositional patterns will have implications for personalized microbiota-based solutions. there have been limited enterotype based studies on colorectal adenoma and cancer.

Bacteriological analysis and antibiotic resistance in patients with diabetic foot ulcers in Dhaka.,"The primary objective of this study was to isolate bacteria from diabetic foot ulcers and subsequently assess their antibiotic resistance capabilities. Seventy-five patients diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcers were investigated. A number of these patients (97.33%) had type 2 diabetes, with a significant proportion of them having been diagnosed for 1-5 years (29.33%). Notably, a substantial number of these individuals were on insulin usage (78.66%). Among the patients under examination, 49.33% reported having no use of tobacco products, alcohol, or betel leaf. The ulcers analyzed in this study were classified into grades 1-5 according to the Wagner scale. Wagner grade 2 diabetic foot ulcers had the highest number of culture-positive patients, at 33.33%. Pus samples collected from patients were cultured on selective media, and bacterial identity was confirmed by biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction. A total of 141 isolates were isolated. Among the isolates, 82.97% gram-negative bacteria and 17.02% gram-positive bacteria were detected. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common isolate. Proteus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were also detected. Approximately 61.33% of the ulcers exhibited were polybacterial. In this study, it was observed that all bacterial isolates, except for Proteus spp., were primarily detected in patients classified under Wagner's grade 2. Moreover, antibiotic susceptibility was also tested on these 141 isolates. Among them, Escherichia coli showed the highest multidrug resistance, 81.81%. Most of the gram-negative bacteria were resistant to ampicillin. All of the gram-negative isolates exhibited high levels of susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam, and these levels were Klebsiella pneumoniae (97.56%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (95.24%), Escherichia coli (81.82%), and Proteus spp. (80%). On the other hand, gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus mostly showed sensitivity towards vancomycin and norfloxacin (79.17%).",['Baral P; Afnan N; Ahmad Zahra M; Akter B; Rabia Prapti S; Muazzam Hossan M; Haque FKM'],2024,97.33% of diabetic foot ulcers were diagnosed for 1-5 years. a significant proportion of these patients had type 2 diabetes. a total of 141 isolates were isolated.
"Alarmins in cutaneous malignant melanoma: An updated overview of emerging evidence on their pathogenetic, diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic role.","Malignant cutaneous melanoma is the leading cause of death for skin cancer to date, with globally increasing incidence rates. In this epidemiological scenario, international scientific research is exerting efforts to identify new clinical strategies aimed at the prognostic amelioration of the disease. Very promising and groundbreaking in this context is the scientific interest related to alarmins and their pioneering utility in the setting of the pathogenetic understanding, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy for malignant cutaneous melanoma. However, the scientific investigations on this matter should not overlook their still well-presented dual and contradictory role. The aim of our critical analysis is to provide an up-to-date overview of the emerging evidence concerning the dichotomous role of alarmins in the aforementioned clinical settings. Our literature revision was based on the extensive body of both preclinical and clinical findings published on the PubMed database over the past 5 years.

Accelerating diabetic wound healing by ROS-scavenging lipid nanoparticle-mRNA formulation.,"Current treatment options for diabetic wounds face challenges due to low efficacy, as well as potential side effects and the necessity for repetitive treatments. To address these issues, we report a formulation utilizing trisulfide-derived lipid nanoparticle (TS LNP)-mRNA therapy to accelerate diabetic wound healing by repairing and reprogramming the microenvironment of the wounds. A library of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive TS LNPs was designed and developed to encapsulate interleukin-4 (IL4) mRNA. TS2-IL4 LNP-mRNA effectively scavenges excess ROS at the wound site and induces the expression of IL4 in macrophages, promoting the polarization from the proinflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype at the wound site. In a diabetic wound model of db/db mice, treatment with this formulation significantly accelerates wound healing by enhancing the formation of an intact epidermis, angiogenesis, and myofibroblasts. Overall, this TS LNP-mRNA platform not only provides a safe, effective, and convenient therapeutic strategy for diabetic wound healing but also holds great potential for clinical translation in both acute and chronic wound care.",['Wang S; Zhang Y; Zhong Y; Xue Y; Liu Z; Wang C; Kang DD; Li H; Hou X; Tian M; Cao D; Wang L; Guo K; Deng B; McComb DW; Merad M; Brown BD; Dong Y'],2024,"a lipid nanoparticle (TS LNP)-mRNA platform is used to accelerate diabetic wound healing. the TS LNP-mRNA platform is a safe, effective, and convenient therapeutic strategy for diabetic wound healing."
NIR-II Light-Driven Genetically Engineered Exosome Nanocatalysts for Efficient Phototherapy against Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) poses a significant therapeutic challenge due to its invasive nature and limited drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In response, here we present an innovative biomimetic approach involving the development of genetically engineered exosome nanocatalysts (Mn@Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>@RGE-Exos) for efficient GBM therapy via improving the BBB penetration and enzyme-like catalytic activities. Interestingly, a photothermally activatable multiple enzyme-like reactivity is observed in such a nanosystem. Upon NIR-II light irradiation, Mn@Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>@RGE-Exos are capable of converting hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, oxygen, and superoxide radicals, providing a peroxidase (POD), oxidase (OXD), and catalase (CAT)-like nanocatalytic cascade. This consequently leads to strong oxidative stresses to damage GBM cells. In vitro, in vivo, and proteomic analysis further reveal the potential of Mn@Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>@RGE-Exos for the disruption of cellular homeostasis, enhancement of immunological response, and the induction of cancer cell ferroptosis, showcasing a great promise in anticancer efficacy against GBM with a favorable biosafety profile. Overall, the success of this study provides a feasible strategy for future design and clinical study of stimuli-responsive nanocatalytic medicine, especially in the context of challenging brain cancers like GBM.",['Fang X; Gong R; Yang D; Li C; Zhang Y; Wang Y; Nie G; Li M; Peng X; Zhang B'],2024,a biomimetic approach involving the development of genetically engineered exosome nanocatalysts (Mn@Bisub>2/sub>Sesub>3/sub>@RGE-Exos) is used to improve the BBB penetration and enzyme-like catalytic activities. this leads to strong oxidative stresses to damage GBM cells.
"Restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion strategies for people with haematological malignancies treated with intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, with or without haematopoietic stem cell support.","An estimated one-quarter to one-half of people diagnosed with haematological malignancies experience anaemia. There are different strategies for red blood cell (RBC) transfusions to treat anaemia. A restrictive transfusion strategy permits a lower haemoglobin (Hb) level whereas a liberal transfusion strategy aims to maintain a higher Hb. The most effective and safest strategy is unknown. To determine the efficacy and safety of restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategies for people diagnosed with haematological malignancies treated with intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, with or without a haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRS) in MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1982), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2023, Issue 2), and eight other databases (including three trial registries) to 21 March 2023. We also searched grey literature and contacted experts in transfusion for additional trials. There were no language, date or publication status restrictions. We included RCTs and prospective NRS that evaluated restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion strategies in children or adults with malignant haematological disorders receiving intensive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, with or without HSCT. Two authors independently screened references, full-text reports of potentially relevant studies, extracted data from the studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Any disagreement was discussed and resolved with a third review author. Dichotomous outcomes were presented as a risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Narrative syntheses were used for heterogeneous outcome measures. Review Manager Web was used to meta-analyse the data. Main outcomes of interest included: all-cause mortality at 31 to 100 days, quality of life, number of participants with any bleeding, number of participants with clinically significant bleeding, serious infections, length of hospital admission (days) and hospital readmission at 0 to 3 months. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Nine studies met eligibility; eight RCTs and one NRS. Six hundred and forty-four participants were included from six completed RCTs (n = 560) and one completed NRS (n = 84), with two ongoing RCTs consisting of 294 participants (260 adult and 34 paediatric) pending inclusion. Only one completed RCT included children receiving HSCT (n = 6); the other five RCTs only included adults: 239 with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy and 315 receiving HSCT (166 allogeneic and 149 autologous). The transfusion threshold ranged from 70 g/L to 80 g/L for restrictive and from 80 g/L to 120 g/L for liberal strategies. Effects were reported in the summary of findings tables only for the trials that included adults to reduce indirectness due to the limited evidence contributed by the prematurely terminated paediatric trial. Evidence from RCTs Overall, there may be little to no difference in the number of participants who die within 31 to 100 days using a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy, but the evidence is very uncertain (three studies; 451 participants; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.70, P=0.99; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in quality of life at 0 to 3 months using a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy, but the evidence is very uncertain (three studies; 431 participants; analysis unable to be completed due to heterogeneity; very low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in the number of participants who suffer from any bleeding at 0 to 3 months using a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (three studies; 448 participants; RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, P = 0.22; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in the number of participants who suffer from clinically significant bleeding at 0 to 3 months using a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (four studies; 511 participants; RR: 0.94, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.19, P = 0.60; low-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference in the number of participants who experience serious infections at 0 to 3 months using a restrictive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (three studies, 451 participants; RR: 1.20, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.55, P = 0.17; low-certainty evidence). A restrictive transfusion strategy likely results in little to no difference in the length of hospital admission at 0 to 3 months compared to a liberal strategy (two studies; 388 participants; analysis unable to be completed due to heterogeneity in reporting; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be little to no difference between hospital readmission using a restrictive transfusion strategy compared to a liberal transfusion strategy (one study, 299 participants; RR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.50; P = 0.65; low-certainty evidence). Evidence from NRS The evidence is very uncertain whether a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy: reduces the risk of death within 100 days (one study, 84 participants, restrictive 1 death; liberal 1 death; very low-certainty evidence); or decreases the risk of clinically significant bleeding (one study, 84 participants, restrictive 3; liberal 8; very low-certainty evidence). No NRS reported on the other eligible outcomes. Findings from this review were based on seven studies and 644 participants. Definite conclusions are challenging given the relatively few included studies, low number of included participants, heterogeneity of intervention and outcome reporting, and overall certainty of evidence. To increase the certainty of the true effect of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy on clinical outcomes, there is a need for rigorously designed and executed studies. The evidence is largely based on two populations: adults with acute leukaemia receiving intensive chemotherapy and adults with haematologic malignancy requiring HSCT. Despite the addition of 405 participants from three RCTs to the previous review's results, there is still insufficient evidence to answer this review's primary outcome. If we assume a mortality rate of 3% within 100 days, we would need a total of 1492 participants to have an 80% chance of detecting, at a 5% level of significance, an increase in all-cause mortality from 3% to 6%. Further RCTs are needed overall, particularly in children.",['Radford M; Estcourt LJ; Sirotich E; Pitre T; Britto J; Watson M; Brunskill SJ; Fergusson DA; Dorée C; Arnold DM'],2024,restrictive transfusion strategy permits a lower haemoglobin (Hb) level. liberal transfusion strategy aims to maintain a higher Hb. most effective and safest strategy is unknown.

This study is aimed at isolating and establishing the distribution of antibiotic-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> from fecal samples in subjects with cancer admitted to the Oncology Department at Laquintinie Hospital in Douala, in the Littoral Region of Cameroon. A cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2021 to March 2023. Cancer and noncancer patients were suffering from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection. The isolation of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> was based on culture on the specific medium. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used for drug susceptibility testing. Of the 507 patients studied, 307 (60.55%) were cancer patients, compared to 200 (39.45%) noncancer patients. <i>S. aureus</i> was isolated in 81 (15.97%) participants, among which 62 (76.55%) were cancer patients and 19 (23.45%) were noncancer patients. In the study population, 31.92% of participants had breast cancer, followed by cervical cancer (13.68%) and leukemia (7.17%). <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> isolates showed high resistance rates in cancer patients compared to noncancer patients to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC, 77.42% versus 31.58%), cefoxitin (FOX, 80.65% versus 63.16%), ciprofloxacin (CIP, 75.81% versus 26.32%), ofloxacin (OFX, 69.35% versus 31.58%), fusidic acid (FUS, 70.97% versus 53.63%), and tetracycline (TET, 85.48% versus 78.95%). <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> showed a significant increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) phenotypes in cancer patients compared to noncancer patients (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The prevalence of MRSA was 76.54%, higher than that of methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MSSA) (23.46%).

"Chronic Kidney Disease Risk Awareness and Dietary Intake, and Food Security Among Black Male College Students.","Nutrition, lifestyle factors, and awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk are vital tools for preventing or delaying its development and progression in Black American (BA) males. Few published studies assess awareness of CKD risk in BA male college students despite being at high risk. This study aimed to 1) assess the awareness of CKD risk among BA male college students and 2) identify dietary and lifestyle habits related to CKD risk. This was a cross-sectional online survey utilizing a network sampling technique. Inclusion criteria were self-identification as a Black American male and current enrollment in a university. Participants were recruited through publicly available social media sites and emails. The online questionnaire contained demographic, health status, and food security items. Pearson's correlations explored associations between continuous variables; independent samples t-tests compared mean scores of responses between perceived risk of disease groups. Sixty-seven participants completed the survey. Only 22.4% perceived they were at increased risk for kidney disease, while 49.3% felt at increased risk for developing hypertension (HTN). More respondents (32.8%) also felt at increased risk for developing diabetes than kidney disease. Dietary sodium restriction was reported by 34.3%, while only 14.9% had been advised to do so by a healthcare provider. Half of the respondents were deemed food insecure, and 17.86% were categorized as experiencing very low food security. Awareness of CKD risk is low for BA male college students and lags behind awareness of HTN and diabetes risk. There may be a lack of knowledge regarding CKD as a long-term complication of HTN and diabetes. Dietary sodium restriction is marginal, and food security is a significant challenge in this high-risk group. Educational initiatives are needed to increase awareness of CKD risk among BA male college students.",['Morrow EA; Robinson K; Capers W; Camel SP'],2024,"a cross-sectional online survey aimed to assess awareness of CKD risk among black american college students. the online questionnaire contained demographic, health status, and food security items. a third of the respondents were deemed food insecure."
Mineral composition and heavy metal risk assesment of selected geophagic soils from Tanzania.,"Geophagy or Pica is the unintentional traditional behavior of eating soil by indigenous people in different countries. practiced in many countries due to nausea among pregnant women and mineral deficiencies without knowing the associated health risks. In this study the mineral composition of geophagic soil and its associated health risk among consumers was determined. Dry soil sticks consumed by women were obtained from open markets in Morogoro, Njombe and Mwanza regions in Tanzania. The elemental concentration of geophagic soil was analyzed using Flame Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer. Health risk assessment methods were used to obtain health information after chronic exposure to geophagic soils. The tests used were Target Hazard Quotients (THQ), Total Target Hazard Quotients (TTHQ) and Cancer Risks (CR). The concentration range of metals in samples obtained from three different regions were 16,335.7-47,773.7 mg/kg for Fe, 46.2-1073.5 mg/kg for Ca, 155.3-514.9 mg/kg for K, 44.5-112.4 mg/kg for Zn, 40.7-95.1 mg/kg for Na, 2.4-66.7 mg/kg for Cu, 109.5-572.6 mg/kg for Mn, 3.8-6.85 mg/kg for Pb, 3.1-93 mg/kg for Ni, 62.7-638.6 mg/kg for Cr and 0.4 mg/kg for Cd. The Provisional Daily Intake (PDI), THQ, TTHQ and CR ranged between 3.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> -34.12 mg/kg/day bw, 0.043-48.75, 34.52-77.36 and 2.55×10<sup>-5</sup>- 0.23 respectively. The TTHQ>1 was evident for metals in all sampling sites which is indicative of non-carcinogenic health effects. Prolonged exposure to Pb at low concentrations in samples from all the sites can cause pathological effects. The cancer risk values for Pb, Ni, Cr and Cd were <1 in which the consumer is likely not to develop cancer in a life time. Essential minerals - Fe, Ca, Zn, Na, K and toxic metals Pb, Cr, Ni and Cu were detected in all the samples. Cd occurred only in samples from Mwanza region that was below the tolerable daily intake. According to WHO/FAO expert's joint committee any amount of Pb consumption is not permitted. Given the presence of essential minerals in the geophagic soils which are however accompanied by toxic minerals in some cases which might have carcinogenic effects, prolonged consumption should be discouraged to avoid risks of serious adverse effects to the health of the general population.",['Rukondo CE; Mgina CA; Pratap HB'],2024,geophagy or Pica is the traditional behavior of eating soil by indigenous people in different countries. practiced in many countries due to nausea among pregnant women.
Pen needle use patterns in an insured population with diabetes: US retrospective claims analysis.,"People with diabetes who inject insulin with pen devices may reuse the pen needles (PNs), a practice that can cause PN tip deformity, breakage, and contamination, and that is associated with lipohypertrophy and injection-related pain. This retrospective study aimed to estimate the extent of PN reuse among people with diabetes in two insured populations in the United States. Using claims data for Commercial Fully Insured (CFI) and Medicare Advantage (MA) populations from 1-Oct-2018 to 31-Dec-2022, we identified adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1D/T2D) who had ≥1 claim for PNs and ≥2 claims for insulin from 1-Jan-2019 to 31-Dec-2021, with continuous medical/pharmacy eligibility for 3 months before first claim and 1 year after (follow-up). Those receiving hospice or palliative care or using mail-order prescriptions were excluded. We compared actual annual fill rate of PNs with expected fill rate (assuming single use) according to prescribed insulin regimen. Whether the annual actual-to-expected ratio for PN numbers equaled 1 was evaluated using sign tests with 2-sided p-values. Median annual actual-to-expected ratios ranged from 0.41 (T1D basal+prandial cohort) to 0.82 (T2D basal cohort; all p<0.001) in the CFI population (N=10,854), and from 0.55 (TID basal+prandial) to 1.10 (T2D basal and basal+prandial; p=0.382 to <0.001) in the MA population (N=32,495); medians were 0.34 and 0.55 for four expected T2D basal+prandial injections/day in CFI and MA populations, respectively (p<0.001). Annual actual-to-expected ratios were <1 for 62% and 47% of CFI and MA populations, respectively. An estimated 2-27% and 0-17%, respectively, depending on insulin regimen, had inadequate supplies of PNs suggesting that PNs could have been used ≥5 times. These findings highlight the need for educating people with diabetes about reasons for avoiding PN reuse and the key role that pharmacists can play in providing this information and adequate supplies of PNs.",['Lupton L; Sun X; Javadi P; Goldman JD; Cornell S; Fernandes J; Kishorekumar S; Thach A; Sieradzan R'],2024,a retrospective study aimed to estimate the extent of PN reuse among people with diabetes in two insured populations in the united states. the study compared actual annual fill rate of PNs with expected fill rate.
Analysis of COVID-19 Infection in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was responsible for higher morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients (RTx). The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 infection on RTx in a single center in Brazil. A cohort of 135 RTx was evaluated between December 2019 and June 202l, and demographics, clinical, and laboratory profiles were analyzed from deceased donors with COVID-19. Diabetic and RTx from extended criterion donors presented more frequently the severe form of the disease. Serum creatinine (sCr) after 3 months of diagnosis of COVID-19 varied according to the severity of infection. The lethality rate was higher in the group with severe symptoms (65%) compared with those with mild infection (1.5%). The increase in sCr was associated with disease severity. The lethality rate for COVID-19 was 26.6%. These rates are 10-20 times higher than those reported in the general population and suggest that rigorous observation, early diagnosis, and disease prevention measures are crucial in RTx.",['Marinelli TQ; Caldas HC; Ferreira-Baptista MAS; Gorayeb-Polacchini FS; Souza ACB; Marzochi LL; da Silva GJL; Fernandes-Charpiot IMM; Abbud-Filho M'],2024,RTx was a major cause of higher morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. a cohort of 135 RTx was evaluated between December 2019 and June 202l. a cohort of 135 RTx was evaluated between December 2019 and June 202l.
L-carnitine protects the lung from radiation-induced damage in rats via the AMPK/SIRT1/TGF-1ß pathway.,"Radiotherapy (RAD) is a common cancer treatment method, but it can have unintended lung side effects. L-carnitine (LCAR) is an amino acid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aims to demonstrate the effects of LCAR against radiation-induced acute lung injury and to elucidate its possible protective molecular mechanisms. A total of 32 Wistar albino rats were separated into four groups: control, RAD (10 Gy once on 1st day), RAD + LCAR (intraperitoneally, 200 mg/kg/d, for 10 days), and LCAR. At the end of the experiment, the rats were euthanized, and the lung tissues were collected for histopathological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic analysis. Emphysema, pronounced hyperemia, increased total oxidant status, and increased caspase-3 and TNF-α immunostainings were all seen in the lung tissues of the RAD group. LCAR treatment reduced these negative effects. In addition, AMPK and SIRT1 gene expressions increased in the RAD + LCAR group compared to the RAD group, while TGF-1ß gene expression decreased. While RAD caused major damage to the lungs of rats, LCAR application reduced this damage through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Specifically, LCAR reduced fibrosis while attenuating RAD-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via the AMPK/SIRT1/TGF-1ß pathway. Therefore, LCAR can be considered a supplement to reduce complications associated with RAD.",['Karakuyu NF; Özseven A; Akın SE; Çamaş HE; Özmen Ö; Cengiz Ç'],2024,LCAR is an amino acid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

PARP1-DOT1L transcription axis drives acquired resistance to PARP inhibitor in ovarian cancer.,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) resistance poses a significant challenge in ovarian carcinoma (OC). While the role of DOT1L in cancer and chemoresistance is acknowledged, its specific role in PARPi resistance remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism of DOT1L in PARPi resistance in OC patients. This study analyzed the expression of DOT1L in PARPi-resistant cell lines compared to sensitive ones and correlated it with clinical outcomes in OC patients. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were conducted using cellular and mouse models. Molecular investigations, including RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assays, were employed to unravel the molecular mechanisms of DOT1L-mediated PARPi resistance. Our investigation revealed a robust correlation between DOT1L expression and clinical PARPi resistance in non-BRCA mutated OC cells. Upregulated DOT1L expression in PARPi-resistant tissues was associated with diminished survival in OC patients. Mechanistically, we identified that PARP1 directly binds to the DOT1L gene promoter, promoting transcription independently of its enzyme activity. PARP1 trapping induced by PARPi treatment amplified this binding, enhancing DOT1L transcription and contributing to drug resistance. Sequencing analysis revealed that DOT1L plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of PLCG2 and ABCB1 via H3K79me2. This established the PARP1-DOT1L-PLCG2/ABCB1 axis as a key contributor to PARPi resistance. Furthermore, we discovered that combining a DOT1L inhibitor with PARPi demonstrated a synergistic effect in both cell line-derived xenograft mouse models (CDXs) and patient-derived organoids (PDOs). Our results demonstrate that DOT1L is an independent prognostic marker for OC patients. The PARP1-DOT1L/H3K79me2-PLCG2/ABCB1 axis is identified as a pivotal contributor to PARPi resistance.

Association between diabetes mellitus and primary biliary cholangitis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational studies have demonstrated a link between diabetes mellitus(DM) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Nevertheless, since these relationships might be confused, whether there is any causal connection or in which direction it exists is unclear. Our investigation aimed to identify the causal associations between DM and PBC. We acquired genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets for PBC, Type 1 diabetes(T1DM), and Type 2 diabetes(T2DM) from published GWASs. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), Simple mode, and weighted mode methods were used to determine the causal relationships between DM(T1DM or T2DM) and PBC. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to ensure the results were robust. To determine the causal relationship between PBC and DM(T1DM or T2DM), we also used reverse MR analysis. T1DM was associated with a higher risk of PBC (OR 1.1525; 95% CI 1.0612-1.2517; <i>p</i> = 0.0007) in the IVW method, but no evidence of a causal effect T2DM on PBC was found (OR 0.9905; 95% CI 0.8446-1.1616; <i>p</i> = 0.9071) in IVW. Results of the reverse MR analysis suggested genetic susceptibility that PBC was associated with an increased risk of T1DM (IVW: OR 1.1991; 95% CI 1.12-1.2838; <i>p</i> = 1.81E-07), but no evidence of a causal effect PBC on T2DM was found (IVW: OR 1.0101; 95% CI 0.9892-1.0315; <i>p</i> = 0.3420). The current study indicated that T1DM increased the risk of developing PBC and vice versa. There was no proof of a causal connection between PBC probability and T2DM. Our results require confirmation through additional replication in larger populations.",['Lv D; Wang H; Leng Y; Chen S; Sun H; Meng X; Liu T; Xiong Z'],2024,"previous observational studies have demonstrated a link between diabetes mellitus(DM) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). this is because these relationships might be confused, but whether there is any causal connection or in which direction it exists is unclear."
Reduced Thalamic Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) in Painless but not Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.,"Alterations in the structure, function, and microcirculation of the thalamus, a key brain region involved in pain pathways, have previously been demonstrated in patients with Painless- and Painful-diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). However, thalamic neurotransmitter levels including GABA (inhibitory neurotransmitter) and glutamate (excitatory neurotransmitter) in different DPN phenotypes are not known. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy study and quantified GABA and glutamate levels within the thalamus, in a carefully characterised cohort of participants with Painless- and Painful-DPN. Participants with DPN (Painful- and Painless combined) had a significantly lower GABA:H2O ratio compared to those without DPN (Healthy volunteers [HV] and diabetes without DPN [No-DPN]). Participants with Painless-DPN had the lowest GABA:H2O ratio, which reached significance compared with HV and No-DPN, but not Painful-DPN. There was no difference in GABA:H2O in Painful-DPN compared with all other groups. A significant correlation with GABA:H2O and neuropathy severity was also seen. This study demonstrates that lower levels of thalamic GABA in participants with Painless-DPN may reflect neuroplasticity due to reduced afferent pain impulses. Whereas partially preserved levels of GABA in Painful-DPN may indicate that central GABAergic pathways are involved in the mechanisms of neuropathic pain in diabetes.",['Shillo P; Sloan G; Selvarajah D; Greig M; Gandhi R; Anand P; Edden RA; Wilkinson ID; Tesfaye S'],2024,thalamus is a key brain region involved in pain pathways. thalamic neurotransmitter levels including GABA and glutamate are not known. participants with painless-DPN had the lowest GABA:H2O ratio.
"Characteristics, clinical laboratory, histopathology, and outcomes of glycogenic hepatopathy in children.","Glycogenic hepatopathy (GH) is a rare complication of type I diabetes mellitus (DM1), resulting in abnormal deposition of glycogen in the liver due to poor glycemic control. Clinical characteristics and natural history of GH are not completely understood in children. In this study, we investigated clinical, biochemical, histologic parameters and outcomes in children with GH. This was a retrospective review of patients less than 18 years old diagnosed with GH and DM. GH was confirmed on liver biopsy. Medical records were reviewed for clinical presentation, laboratory tests, and clinical outcomes. Liver biopsy findings were reviewed by a pediatric pathologist (I. A. G.). Nine children were diagnosed with GH and type 1 DM. The median age at diagnosis of GH was 16 (IQR 14.5-17) years. Duration of diagnosis of DM until GH diagnosis was 7 (IQR 5-11) years. The median frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis before GH diagnosis was three times (IQR 2-5.25). Peak Aspartate transaminase (AST) and Alanine transaminase (ALT) ranged from 115 to 797, and 83-389 units/L, respectively. Only two children had mild fibrosis. Seven of nine had steatosis without steatohepatitis. There was no correlation between glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or other laboratory tests and liver fibrosis on biopsy. HbA1c was 11.2 (IQR 10.2-12.8) at GH diagnosis and 9.8 (IQR 9.5-10.8) with normalization of liver enzymes. GH appears to be related to poor glycemic control in teenagers with long-term diabetes. GH presents with high to very high aminotransferase especially AST > ALT and resolves with modestly improved glycemic control. Diffuse hepatocyte swelling, steatosis, minimal fibrosis without hepatocyte ballooning or lobular inflammation are most common histological features.",['Jarasvaraparn C; González IA; Tolliver KM; Haddad NG; Molleston JP'],2024,GH is a rare complication of type I diabetes mellitus (DM1).

Renal Cell Carcinoma of Variant Histology: New Biologic Understanding Leads to Therapeutic Advances.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the 10 most commonly diagnosed solid tumors. Most RCCs are histologically defined as clear cell, comprising approximately 75% of diagnoses. However, the remaining RCC cases are composed of a heterogeneous combination of diverse histopathologic subtypes, each with unique pathogeneses and clinical features. Although the therapeutic approach to both localized and metastatic RCCs has dramatically changed, first with the advent of antiangiogenic targeted therapies and more recently with the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combinations, these advances have primarily benefited the clear cell RCC patient population. As such, there remains critical gaps in the optimization of treatment regimens for patients with non-clear cell, or variant, RCC histologies. Herein, we detail recent advances in understanding the biology of RCC with variant histology and how such findings have guided novel clinical studies investigating precision oncology approaches for these rare subtypes. Among the most common variant histology RCCs are papillary RCC, comprising approximately 15%-20% of all diagnoses. Although a histopathologically diverse subset of tumors, papillary RCC is canonically associated with amplification of the <i>MET</i> protooncogene; recently completed and ongoing trials have investigated <i>MET-</i>directed therapies for this patient population. Finally, we discuss the unique biology of RCC with sarcomatoid dedifferentiation and the recent clinical findings detailing its paradoxical sensitivity to ICIs.",['Salgia NJ; Zengin ZB; Pal SK; Dizman N'],2024,"most RCCs are histologically defined as clear cell, comprising approximately 75% of diagnoses. however, the remaining RCC cases are composed of a heterogeneous combination of diverse histopathologic subtypes. this is primarily benefited the clear cell RCC patient population."
"Epidemiological Characterisation of Chronic Diseases Among Civil Servants in Hebei Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Real-World Study of Approximately 50,000 Adults.","The objective of this investigation was to explore the health status and epidemiological features of civil servants working in Hebei Province, China. Data was collected through a cross-sectional survey that involved 50,039 adult civil servants in Hebei Province. The research was conducted at the Hebei Provincial Medical Examination Centre and included inquiries about demographics, health behaviours, chronic illnesses, and abnormal check-up indicators. Statistical data were used to determine the prevalence of chronic diseases and abnormal health examination indicators. Subgroup analyses by sex were then conducted to calculate the similarities and differences in health status between men and women. The findings of the survey indicate that 14.2% of individuals who work in civil service suffer from obesity. Additionally, a considerable proportion of this group display poor health behaviours, including smoking and alcohol consumption. Hypertension (21.03%), dyslipidaemia (10.88%), and diabetes mellitus (8.56%) were identified as the top three chronic diseases, while cardiovascular diseases were prevalent at 6.27% among civil servants. Ultrasound showed a high prevalence of fatty liver, non-smooth gallbladder and liver cysts (44.61%, 33.24% and 23.26% respectively). The occurrence of pulmonary nodules was alarmingly high at 88.48%, while thyroid nodules were found in as much as 62.65% of patients. Abnormal E/A values≤1, prostate hyperplasia, breast nodules, and carotid plaques were also prevalent, with percentages ranging from 46.76% to 63.04%. In subgroup analyses by gender, the prevalence of chronic diseases and abnormal screening indicators was consistently higher in men than in women, with the exception of thyroid nodules and thyroid surgery. The survey revealed a large proportion of civil servants in Hebei Province, China, suffering from chronic diseases, underscoring the necessity for enhanced attention to chronic disease prevention and management in this group and emphasising the requirement for focused interventions aimed at improving health outcomes.",['Pan X; Wang S; Jia B; Yue L; Chen S'],2024,"the study was conducted at the Hebei Provincial Medical Examination Centre. it included inquiries about demographics, health behaviours, chronic illnesses, and abnormal check-up indicators. subgroup analyses by sex were then conducted to calculate similarities and differences in health status between men and women."
Sea urchin nanostructured nickel cobaltite modified carbon cloth integrated wearable patches for the on-site detection of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate mofetil.,"Mycophenolate mofetil (MpM) is a medication used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs, particularly in kidney, heart, and liver transplant surgeries. It is extremely important to be conscious that MpM can raise the risk of severe infections and some cancers if it exceeds the recommended dose while lower doses will result in organ rejections. So, it is essential to monitor the dosage of MpM in real time in the micromolar range. In this work, we have synthesized 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) functionalized nickel cobaltite (NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and this amino functionalization was chosen to enhance the stability and electrochemical activity of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The enhanced activity of NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was used for developing an electrochemical sensor for the detection of MpM. APTES functionalized NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was coated on carbon cloth and used as the working electrode. Surface functionalization with APTES on NiCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was aimed at augmenting the adsorption/interaction of MpM due to its binding properties. The developed sensor showed a very low detection limit of 1.23 nM with linear ranges of 10-100 nM and 1-100 μM and its practical applicability was examined using artificial samples of blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid, validating its potential application in real-life scenarios.",['Niyas K; Richard B; Ankitha M; Rasheed PA'],2024,mycophenolate mofetil (MpM) is a medication used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. it is extremely important to be conscious that MpM can raise the risk of severe infections and some cancers if it exceeds the recommended dose.
Oral and non-oral lichen planus show genetic heterogeneity and differential risk for autoimmune disease and oral cancer.,"Lichen planus (LP) is a T-cell-mediated inflammatory disease affecting squamous epithelia in many parts of the body, most often the skin and oral mucosa. Cutaneous LP is usually transient and oral LP (OLP) is most often chronic, so we performed a large-scale genetic and epidemiological study of LP to address whether the oral and non-oral subgroups have shared or distinct underlying pathologies and their overlap with autoimmune disease. Using lifelong records covering diagnoses, procedures, and clinic identity from 473,580 individuals in the FinnGen study, genome-wide association analyses were conducted on carefully constructed subcategories of OLP (n = 3,323) and non-oral LP (n = 4,356) and on the combined group. We identified 15 genome-wide significant associations in FinnGen and an additional 12 when meta-analyzed with UKBB (27 independent associations at 25 distinct genomic locations), most of which are shared between oral and non-oral LP. Many associations coincide with known autoimmune disease loci, consistent with the epidemiologic enrichment of LP with hypothyroidism and other autoimmune diseases. Notably, a third of the FinnGen associations demonstrate significant differences between OLP and non-OLP. We also observed a 13.6-fold risk for tongue cancer and an elevated risk for other oral cancers in OLP, in agreement with earlier reports that connect LP with higher cancer incidence. In addition to a large-scale dissection of LP genetics and comorbidities, our study demonstrates the use of comprehensive, multidimensional health registry data to address outstanding clinical questions and reveal underlying biological mechanisms in common but understudied diseases.",['Reeve MP; Vehviläinen M; Luo S; Ritari J; Karjalainen J; Gracia-Tabuenca J; Mehtonen J; Padmanabhuni SS; Kolosov N; Artomov M; Siirtola H; Olilla HM; Graham D; Partanen J; Xavier RJ; Daly MJ; Ripatti S; Salo T; Siponen M'],2024,LP is a inflammatory disease affecting squamous epithelia in many parts of the body. a third of the FinnGen associations demonstrate significant differences between LP and non-OLP.

Effectiveness of Peripheral Nerve Block in Terms of Search for a Standardized Treatment Protocol in Diabetic Foot Patients Using Anticoagulants: A Double-Center Study.,"Lower-extremity amputation for a diabetic foot is mainly performed under general or central neuraxial anesthesia. Ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block (PNB) can be a good alternative, especially for patients who require continuous anticoagulation treatment and patients with additional comorbidities. We evaluated bleeding due to PNB application in patients with diabetic foot receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy. Perioperative morbidity and mortality and the need for intensive care hospitalization were analyzed. This study included 105 patients with diabetic foot or debridement who underwent distal foot amputation or debridement between February and October 2020. Popliteal nerve block (17 mL of 5% bupivacaine and 3 mL of saline) and saphenous nerve block (5 mL of 2% lidocaine) were applied to the patients. Postoperative pain scores (at 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours) and complications due to PNB were evaluated. Intensive care admission and 1-month mortality were recorded. The most common diseases accompanying diabetes were hypertension and peripheral artery disease. No complications due to PNB were observed. Mean ± SD postoperative first analgesic need was determined to be 14.1 ± 4.1 hours. Except for one patient, this group was followed up without the need for postoperative intensive care. In 16 patients, bleeding occurred as leakage from the surgical area, and it was stopped with repeated pressure dressing. Mean ± SD patient satisfaction score was 8.36 ± 1.59. Perioperative mortality was not observed. Ultrasound-guided PNB can be an effective and safe anesthetic technique for diabetic patients undergoing distal foot amputation, especially those receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy and considered high risk.",['Ozkan D; Arslan MT; Eskin MB; Sipahioglu FO; Ermis Y; Ozkan G; Yilmaz I; Nalbant B; Yuksel S; Yilmaz KB'],2024,105 patients with diabetic foot or debridement underwent distal foot amputation or debridement between February and October 2020. amputations were performed under general or central neuraxial anesthesia. bleeding due to PNB application was not observed in 16 patients.
Evaluation of Pm2.5 Influence on Human Lung Cancer Cells Using a Microfluidic Platform.,"In this study, we developed a microfluidic device that is able to monitor cell biology under continuous PM2.5 treatment. The effects of PM2.5 on human alveolar basal epithelial cells, A549 cells, and uncovered several significant findings were investigated. The results showed that PM2.5 exposure did not lead to a notable decrease in cell viability, indicating that PM2.5 did not cause cellular injury or death. However, the study found that PM2.5 exposure increased the invasion and migration abilities of A549 cells, suggesting that PM2.5 might promote cell invasiveness. Results of RNA sequencing revealed 423 genes that displayed significant differential expression in response to PM2.5 exposure, with a particular focus on pathways associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction. Real-time detection demonstrated an increase in ROS production in A549 cells after exposure to PM2.5. JC1 assay, which indicated a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in A549 cells exposed to PM2.5. The disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential further supports the detrimental effects of PM2.5 on A549 cells. These findings highlight several adverse effects of PM2.5 on A549 cells, including enhanced invasion and migration capabilities, altered gene expression related to ROS pathways, increased ROS production and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings contribute to our understanding of the potential mechanisms through which PM2.5 can impact cellular function and health.",['Nguyen UTN; Hsieh HY; Chin TY; Wu G; Lin YP; Lee CY; Hsu YC; Fan YJ'],2024,"the effects of PM2.5 on human alveolar basal epithelial cells were investigated. the results showed that PM2.5 exposure did not lead to a notable decrease in cell viability. however, the study found that PM2.5 exposure increased the invasion and migration abilities of A549 cells."
"Does the 3C (Counselling, Checking and Certification) Initiative Prevent Hypoglycemia Among At-Risk Stable Late Preterm and Term Neonates? - A Randomized Controlled Trial.","To evaluate whether the 3C (Counselling, Checking, Certification) initiative helps in preventing hypoglycemia among at-risk neonates compared to standard care. This randomised controlled trial included 222 mother-newborn dyads with risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia-Small for gestational age (SGA) babies, infants of diabetic mothers (IDM), large for gestational age (LGA) babies and late preterm infants (LPI). They were randomized to two groups. Group A received standard care while mothers in group B were administered 3C intervention. Early initiation of breastfeeding, incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia within 24 h, and exclusive breastfeeding rate at 6 mo were evaluated. Early initiation of breastfeeding was higher in the 3C group compared to standard care group (94.6% vs. 55.9% p <0.001). The incidence of hypoglycemia within 24 h was lower in the intervention group compared to standard care (3.6% vs. 15.3%, p <0.05).

Rural and remote pharmacists' perspectives of grey nomads with diabetes travelling in Australia.,"The objective of the research was to explore rural and remote pharmacists' experiences of encountering grey nomads with diabetes. A qualitative Interpretive Description design was used to explore and capture the experiences of rural and remote pharmacists interacting with grey nomads who had diabetes. Data from the interviews were analysed thematically. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia was approached and through their membership rural and remote pharmacists were invited to participate in the research. Nine rural and remote pharmacists who had encounters and provided services to grey nomads with diabetes responded to be interviewed. The analysed findings established four major themes including: the influence of rural and remote locations on services; common problems encountered by the pharmacists; preparation for travel by grey nomads with diabetes; and pharmacists' preparedness to support grey nomads with diabetes. The findings of this study identified that pharmacists needed remuneration for services provided to grey nomads with diabetes. Also, further development of the My Health record and telehealth to include pharmacists would be advantageous for grey nomads who have diabetes. Pharmacists stated there was a need for further education and a continuing professional development module specifically designed for pharmacists on diabetes self-management that moved beyond medications.

Association between the stress-hyperglycemia ratio and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling populations: An analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2014.,"Reportedly, the stress-hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with severe acute disease. However, the community-dwelling may also be in a state of stress due to environmental exposure. Our study aimed to explore the association between SHR and all-cause mortality in the community-dwelling population. A total of 18 480 participants were included out of 82 091 from the NHANES 1999-2014 survey. The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to assess the disparities in survival rates based on SHR, and the log-rank test was employed to investigate the distinctions between groups. The multivariate Cox regression analysis and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were performed to assess the association of SHR with all-cause mortality. A subgroup analysis was also conducted. A total of 3188 deaths occurred during a median follow-up period of 11.0 (7.7; 15.4) years. The highest risk for all-cause mortality was observed when SHR≤ 0.843 or SHR ≥0.986 (log-rank p < .001). After adjusting for the confounding factors, compared with subjects in the second SHR quartile (Q2), participants in the highest (Q4, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-1.73) and lowest quartiles (Q1, adjusted HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16-1.60) have a higher probability of all-cause death. The RCS observed a dose-response U-shaped association between SHR and all-cause mortality. The U-shaped association between SHR and all-cause mortality was similar across subgroup analysis.

Single-nucleotide polymorphism array and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to decode the cytogenetic profile of atypical partial hydatidiform moles diagnosed by short tandem repeat polymorphism analysis.,"Accurate diagnosis of partial hydatidiform moles (PHMs) is crucial for improving outcomes of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. The use of short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphism analysis to distinguish between PHM and hydropic abortuses is instrumental; however, its diagnostic power has not been comprehensively assessed. Herein, we evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of STR in differentiating between PHM and hydropic abortus, thus providing an opportunity for early measurement of human chorionic gonadotropin for PHMs. We reviewed charts of STR polymorphism analysis performed on fresh villous specimens and patient blood samples using a commercial kit for 16 loci. The genetic classification of 79 PHMs was confirmed. STR was reliable in differentiating PHMs when at least 15 loci were available. Typically, PHMs are characterized by their triploidy, including two paternal and one maternal haploid contribution. In our sample, seven PHMs lacked the three-allelic loci, requiring fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to investigate imbalanced biparental conceptus and single-nucleotide polymorphism array analysis to reveal cytogenetic details. Of these PHMs, two, three, and one were identified as androgenetic/biparental mosaics (diploids), monospermic diandric monogynic triploids, and a typical dispermic diandric monogynic triploid, respectively. The remaining case was monospermic origin, but its ploidy details could not be available. Therefore, STR differentiated PHM from a biparental diploid abortus in most cases. However, PHM diagnosis may be compromised when STR is used as the sole method for cases displaying distinct cytogenetic patterns lacking the three-allelic loci, including androgenetic/biparental mosaicism. Therefore, FISH should be considered to confirm the diagnosis.",['Suzuki Y; Usui H; Katayama E; Sato A; Nakamura N; Nakada E; Omoto A; Okayama J; Sato M; Nagasawa A; Hirosawa A; Shozu M; Koga K'],2024,STR polymorphism analysis performed on fresh villous specimens and patient blood samples using a commercial kit for 16 loci.

Feasibility of determining external beam radiotherapy dose using LuSy dosimeter.,"Radiation dose measurement is an essential part of radiotherapy to verify the correct delivery of doses to patients and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in radiotherapy technology have highlighted the need for fast and precise dosimeters. Technologies like FLASH radiotherapy and magnetic-resonance linear accelerators (MR-LINAC) demand dosimeters that can meet their unique requirements. One promising solution is the plastic scintillator-based dosimeter with high spatial resolution and real-time dose output. This study explores the feasibility of using the LuSy dosimeter, an in-house developed plastic scintillator dosimeter for dose verification across various radiotherapy techniques, including conformal radiotherapy (CRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). A new dosimetry system, comprising a new plastic scintillator as the sensing material, was developed and characterized for radiotherapy beams. Treatment plans were created for conformal radiotherapy, IMRT, VMAT, and SRS and delivered to a phantom. LuSy dosimeter was used to measure the delivered dose for each plan on the surface of the phantom and inside the target volumes. Then, LuSy measurements were compared against an ionization chamber, MOSFET dosimeter, radiochromic films, and dose calculated using the treatment planning system (TPS). For CRT, surface dose measurement by LuSy dosimeter showed a deviation of -5.5% and -5.4% for breast and abdomen treatment from the TPS, respectively. When measuring inside the target volume for IMRT, VMAT, and SRS, the LuSy dosimeter produced a mean deviation of -3.0% from the TPS. Surface dose measurement resulted in higher TPS discrepancies where the deviations for IMRT, VMAT, and SRS were -2.0%, -19.5%, and 16.1%, respectively. The LuSy dosimeter was feasible for measuring radiotherapy doses for various treatment techniques. Treatment delivery verification enables early error detection, allowing for safe treatment delivery for radiotherapy patients.",['Wahabi JM; Wong JHD; Mahdiraji GA; Ung NM'],2024,new technology has highlighted the need for fast and precise dosimeters. the plastic scintillator-based dosimeter is a promising solution. the study explores the feasibility of using the LuSy dosimeter.
Borax affects cellular viability by inducing ER stress in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting SLC12A5.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presents a persistent challenge to conventional therapeutic approaches. SLC12A5 is implicated in an oncogenic capacity and facilitates the progression of cancer. The objective of this investigation is to scrutinize the inhibitory effects of borax on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and apoptosis mediated by SLC12A5 in HepG2 cells. Initially, we evaluated the cytotoxic impact of borax on both HL-7702 and HepG2 cell lines. Subsequently, the effects of borax on cellular morphology and the cell cycle of these lines were examined. Following this, we explored the impact of borax treatment on the mRNA and protein expression levels of SLC12A5, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), glucose-regulated protein-78 (GRP78), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), caspase-3 (CASP3), and cytochrome c (CYC) in these cellular populations. The determined IC50 value of borax for HL-7702 cells was 40.8 mM, whereas for HepG2 cells, this value was 22.6 mM. The concentrations of IC50 (22.6 mM) and IC75 (45.7 mM) of borax in HepG2 cells did not manifest morphological aberrations in HL-7702 cells. Conversely, these concentrations in HepG2 cells induced observable morphological and nuclear abnormalities, resulting in cell cycle arrest in the G1/G0 phase. Additionally, the levels of SLC12A5, ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, CASP3, and CYC were elevated in HepG2 cells in comparison to HL-7702 cells. Moreover, SLC12A5 levels decreased following borax treatment in HepG2 cells, whereas ATF6, CHOP, GRP78, CASP3, and CYC levels exhibited a significant increase. In conclusion, our data highlight the potential therapeutic effects of borax through the regulation of ER stress in HCC by targeting SLC12A5.",['Hacioglu C; Oral D'],2024,cytotoxic effects of borax on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and apoptosis mediated by SLC12A5 in HL-7702 and HepG2 cells. cytotoxic effects of borax on cellular morphology and cell cycle of these lines were examined.

A Case of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Fusion-Positive Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma With Humoral Hypercalcemia of Malignancy.,"Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) comprises the majority of cases with malignancy-related hypercalcemia and is mediated by elevated parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). HHM is rare in cholangiocarcinoma and has been reported only in a few case reports and series. We report a case of a 63-year-old male with a history of locally advanced fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) fusion-positive intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma who presented with recurrent HHM. The first episode of his hypercalcemia occurred 15 months after the initial diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and coincided with disease progression.

Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Ethnicity: Lessons Learned from the Arab Population in Israel.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. We aimed to investigate the potential similarities and differences regarding the disease among Arabs and Jews. Retrospective study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved using the MdClone platform from ""Clalit"" in Israel. Data concerning 34,090 Arab patients and 173,500 Jewish patients with NAFLD were included. Arab patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (35.0 ± 13 years vs. 43.6 ± 15 years, p < 0.001) and had higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus (69.5% vs. 56.5% and 27.0% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.001, respectively). Arab patients had higher rates of cirrhosis and portal hypertension-related complications (2.5% vs. 2.0%, p < 0.001), esophageal varices (0.9% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001), and hepatorenal syndrome (0.3% vs. 0.1%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma between study groups (0.4% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.156). Liver transplantation was performed in 0.2% of Arab NAFLD patients compared to 0.07% of Jewish NAFLD patients (p < 0.001). Lower rates of all-cause mortality were found among the Arab NAFLD patients versus Jewish NAFLD patients (7.7% versus 11.5%, p < 0.001). According to the Cox regression model, Arab ethnicity is a risk factor for death with OR of 1.36. Significant differences regarding comorbidities, complications, liver transplantations rates, and all-cause mortality were found among NAFLD patients of different ethnicities, hence specific population need specific consideration in prevention, early diagnosis and follow up.",['Abu-Freha N; Eraki L; Weissmann S; Cohen B; Gordon M; Kaf HA; Etzion O; Tailakh MA; Delgado JS'],2024,"non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease. a study included all patients older than 18 years with NAFLD diagnosis. data concerning demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were retrieved."
Mimickers of autoimmune encephalitis: a literature review.,"Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) is a rapid, progressive neurological disorder characterized by nervous system inflammation. While the Graus criteria are the best known criteria for AIE diagnosis, other differential diagnoses meeting the Graus criteria must be considered before management. This narrative review discusses the most common etiologies that resemble AIE. We suggest routine exclusion of mimickers meeting the Graus criteria before confirming an AIE diagnosis. We reviewed 28 studies including 356 patients. The main initial diagnosis was AIE, then paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis. Only 194 patients met the possible Graus criteria. The most frequent conditions among the total population were dementia, other neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric and functional neurological disorders. AIE is often misdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary treatment. Despite publication of the Graus criteria, medical cases mimicking this condition are being published. Many neurological diseases entering the differential diagnosis of AIE could be excluded through a detailed history, neurological examination, laboratory analysis, and other investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging. However, some differential diagnoses complied with the possible Graus criteria, with some having concurrent antineuronal antibodies, which were considered true mimickers. AIE diagnosis suspicion is primarily clinical, but a definitive diagnosis requires various diagnostic tools.",['Alshutaihi MS; Mazketly M; Tabbakh M; Akkash N; Bahro T; Alsaman MZB'],2024,the Graus criteria are the best known criteria for AIE diagnosis. other differential diagnoses meeting the Graus criteria must be considered before management.
Preventing Diabetic Foot Re-Ulceration Through an Innovative Pressure and Temperature Monitoring Clinical Device.,"This study compared the outcome of an innovative in-shoe pressure and temperature measuring device as an adjunct to standard clinical care for diabetic foot versus standard clinical care alone. It included 88 participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with a history of one or more plantar foot ulceration who were already using prescription orthoses. These were randomly divided into the control group (<i>n </i>= 44, standard care only) and the experimental group (<i>n</i> = 44, standard care plus the innovative device). Both groups were monitored for re-ulceration for one year. Overall, the control group exhibited a higher number of re-ulcerations (<i>n </i>= 14) with 2 amputations in comparison with the experimental group (only 2 ulcerations and no amputations) at the end of the study. In conclusion, this innovative in-shoe pressure and temperature measuring device appears to reduce re-ulcerations by offering objective data for clinical decision making in the management of the diabetic high-risk foot.",['Thorne CS; Gatt A; DeRaffaele C; Attard G; Formosa C; Papanas N'],2024,88 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus with a history of one or more plantar foot ulceration. both groups were monitored for re-ulceration for one year.
"Obstructive Sleep Apnea Among Obese Children in Tabuk City, Saudi Arabia.","Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent among children, impacting their well-being. Obesity and related morbidity may lead to serious health disorders. In obese children, OSA may be a risk factor for systemic diseases that negatively affect their quality of life. This study explored the correlation between obesity and OSA among children aged five to 14 years in Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. Methods This cross-sectional study employed an online questionnaire for the parents of 517 children, assessing sociodemographic variables, medical history, and OSA symptoms. The data analysis used Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY) software, employing descriptive and inferential statistics. Results The children were predominantly male (281, 54.4%) and from Tabuk (405, 78.3%), with 158 (30.6%) classified as obese. Symptoms such as snoring (191, 36.9%), daytime fatigue (195, 37.7%), and impact on daily activities (79, 15.3%) were prevalent. OSA scores significantly correlated with BMI categories (p < 0.001), family history of OSA (p < 0.001), and medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol (p < 0.05). Correlations showed weak positive associations of age (ρ = 0.159) and height (ρ = 0.229) with OSA score, whereas a strong correlation existed between weight (ρ = 0.531) and OSA score (p < 0.001). Conclusion Obesity demonstrated a strong association with OSA severity among children in Tabuk. Higher BMI categories, a family history of OSA, and certain medical conditions correlated significantly with increased OSA scores. Although age and height displayed weaker associations, weight emerged as a major contributing factor to OSA severity. These findings emphasize the importance of addressing obesity in managing pediatric OSA, advocating for early interventions to mitigate its impact on children's health and well-being.",['AlBishi L; Alkhuraisi LS; Alqahtani MM; Alatawi WL; Alghabban AT; Anazi MH; Aljohani HA; Asseiri RA'],2024,obese children may be a risk factor for systemic diseases that negatively affect quality of life. obesity and related morbidity may lead to serious health disorders.
Ampelopsin facilitates diabetic wound healing and keratinocyte cell progression by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in macrophages.,"Ampelopsin (AMP) had a wound-healing effect in rat skin wounds with or without purulent infection. However, the role of AMP in diabetic wound healing remains poorly defined. Wounds were created on the dorsal skin of type 2 diabetic mouse model, and the histological features of wounds were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Caspase-1 activity and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell viability and migration were examined through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and wound healing assays, respectively. AMP facilitated wound healing in vivo. AMP notably facilitated platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-31 (CD31), collagen type I alpha 1 chain (COL1A1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and inhibited matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) expression in diabetic wounds. The inflammasome pathway was implicated in skin injury. AMP inhibited pro-inflammatory factor secretions and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway in diabetic wounds and high glucose-treated THP-1 macrophages. AMP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition in THP-1 macrophages increased cell viability and migratory capacity in HaCaT cells. AMP facilitated diabetic wound healing and increased keratinocyte cell viability and migratory ability by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in macrophages.",['Zhou Q; Cheng G'],2024,AMP facilitated wound healing in vivo.

eTFC-01: a dual-labeled chelate-bridged tracer for SSTR2-positive tumors.,"Integrating radioactive and optical imaging techniques can facilitate the prognosis and surgical guidance for cancer patients. Using a single dual-labeled tracer ensures consistency in both imaging modalities. However, developing such molecule is challenging due to the need to preserve the biochemical properties of the tracer while introducing bulky labeling moieties. In our study, we designed a trifunctional chelate that facilitates the coupling of the targeting vector and fluorescent dye at opposite sites to avoid undesired steric hindrance effects. The synthesis of the trifunctional chelate N<sub>3</sub>-Py-DOTAGA-(tBu)<sub>3</sub> (7) involved a five-step synthetic route, followed by conjugation to the linear peptidyl-resin 8 through solid-phase synthesis. After deprotection and cyclization, the near-infrared fluorescent dye sulfo-Cy.5 was introduced using copper free click chemistry, resulting in eTFC-01. Subsequently, eTFC-01 was labeled with [<sup>111</sup>In]InCl<sub>3</sub>. In vitro assessments of eTFC-01 binding, uptake, and internalization were conducted in SSTR2-transfected U2OS cells. Ex-vivo biodistribution and fluorescence imaging were performed in H69-tumor bearing mice. eTFC-01 demonstrated a two-fold higher IC50 value for SSTR2 compared to the gold standard DOTA-TATE. Labeling of eTFC-01 with [<sup>111</sup>In]InCl<sub>3</sub> gave a high radiochemical yield and purity. The uptake of [<sup>111</sup>In]In-eTFC-01 in U2OS.SSTR2 cells was two-fold lower than the uptake of [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-TATE, consistent with the binding affinity. Tumor uptake in H69-xenografted mice was lower for [<sup>111</sup>In]In-eTFC-01 at all-time points compared to [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-TATE. Prolonged blood circulation led to increased accumulation of [<sup>111</sup>In]In-eTFC-01 in highly vascularized tissues, such as lungs, skin, and heart. Fluorescence measurements in different organs correlated with the radioactive signal distribution. The successful synthesis and coupling of the trifunctional chelate to the peptide and fluorescent dye support the potential of this synthetic approach to generate dual labeled tracers. While promising in vitro, the in vivo results obtained with [<sup>111</sup>In]In-eTFC-01 suggest the need for adjustments to enhance tracer distribution.",['Chapeau D; Beekman S; Handula M; Murce E; de Ridder C; Stuurman D; Seimbille Y'],2024,a single dual-labeled tracer ensures consistency in both imaging modalities. a trifunctional chelate facilitates the coupling of the targeting vector and fluorescent dye at opposite sites to avoid undesired hindrance effects. eTFC-01 was labeled with [sup>111/sup>In]InClsub>3/sub>.
Upstream open reading frames: new players in the landscape of cancer gene regulation.,"The translation of RNA by ribosomes represents a central biological process and one of the most dysregulated processes in cancer. While translation is traditionally thought to occur exclusively in the protein-coding regions of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), recent transcriptome-wide approaches have shown abundant ribosome activity across diverse stretches of RNA transcripts. The most common type of this kind of ribosome activity occurs in gene leader sequences, also known as 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the mRNA, that precede the main coding sequence. Translation of these upstream open reading frames (uORFs) is now known to occur in upwards of 25% of all protein-coding genes. With diverse functions from RNA regulation to microprotein generation, uORFs are rapidly igniting a new arena of cancer biology, where they are linked to cancer genetics, cancer signaling, and tumor-immune interactions. This review focuses on the contributions of uORFs and their associated 5'UTR sequences to cancer biology.",['Dasgupta A; Prensner JR'],2024,translation of RNA by ribosomes represents a central biological process. most common type of ribosome activity occurs in gene leader sequences. uORFs are rapidly igniting a new arena of cancer biology.

Protective Role of the Podocyte IL-15 / STAT5 Pathway in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.,"During glomerular diseases, podocyte-specific pathways can modulate the intensity of histological disease and prognosis. The therapeutic targeting of these pathways could thus improve the management and prognosis of kidney diseases. The Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, classically described in immune cells, has been recently described in detail in intrinsic kidney cells. We describe STAT5 expression in human kidney biopsies from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and studied mice with a podocyte-specific <i>Stat5</i> deletion in experimental glomerular diseases. Here, we show, for the first time, that STAT5 is activated in human podocytes in FSGS. In addition, podocyte-specific <i>Stat5</i> inactivation aggravates the structural and functional alterations in a mouse model of FSGS. This could be due, at least in part, to an inhibition of autophagic flux. Finally, interleukin 15 (IL-15), a classical activator of STAT5 in immune cells, increases STAT5 phosphorylation in human podocytes, and its administration alleviates glomerular injury <i>in vivo</i> by maintaining autophagic flux in podocytes. Activating podocyte STAT5 with commercially available IL-15 represents a potential new therapeutic avenue for FSGS.",['Niasse A; Louis K; Lenoir O; Schwarz C; Xu X; Couturier A; Dobosziewicz H; Corchia A; Placier S; Vandermeersch S; Hennighausen L; Frère P; Galichon P; Surin B; Ouchelouche S; Louedec L; Migeon T; Verpont MC; Yousfi N; Buob D; Xu-Dubois YC; François H; Rondeau E; Mesnard L; Hadchouel J; Luque Y'],2024,the therapeutic targeting of these pathways could thus improve the management and prognosis of kidney diseases. the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription pathway has been recently described in detail in intrinsic kidney cells.
Stratifying risk of disease in haematuria patients using machine learning techniques to improve diagnostics.,"Detailed and invasive clinical investigations are required to identify the causes of haematuria. Highly unbalanced patient population (predominantly male) and a wide range of potential causes make the ability to correctly classify patients and identify patient-specific biomarkers a major challenge. Studies have shown that it is possible to improve the diagnosis using multi-marker analysis, even in unbalanced datasets, by applying advanced analytical methods. Here, we applied several machine learning algorithms to classify patients from the haematuria patient cohort (HaBio) by analysing multiple biomarkers and to identify the most relevant ones. We applied several classification and feature selection methods (k-means clustering, decision trees, random forest with LIME explainer and CACTUS algorithm) to stratify patients into two groups: healthy (with no clear cause of haematuria) or sick (with an identified cause of haematuria e.g., bladder cancer, or infection). The classification performance of the models was compared. Biomarkers identified as important by the algorithms were also analysed in relation to their involvement in the pathological processes. Results showed that a high unbalance in the datasets significantly affected the classification by random forest and decision trees, leading to the overestimation of the sick class and low model performance. CACTUS algorithm was more robust to the unbalance in the dataset. CACTUS obtained a balanced accuracy of 0.747 for both genders, 0.718 for females and 0.803 for males. The analysis showed that in the classification process for the whole dataset: microalbumin, male gender, and tPSA emerged as the most informative biomarkers. For males: age, microalbumin, tPSA, cystatin C, BTA, HAD and S100A4 were the most significant biomarkers while for females microalbumin, IL-8, pERK, and CXCL16. CACTUS algorithm demonstrated improved performance compared with other methods such as decision trees and random forest. Additionally, we identified the most relevant biomarkers for the specific patient group, which could be considered in the future as novel biomarkers for diagnosis. Our results have the potential to inform future research and provide new personalised diagnostic approaches tailored directly to the needs of the individuals.","[""Drożdż A; Duggan B; Ruddock MW; Reid CN; Kurth MJ; Watt J; Irvine A; Lamont J; Fitzgerald P; O'Rourke D; Curry D; Evans M; Boyd R; Sousa J""]",2024,invasive clinical investigations are required to identify the causes of haematuria. highly unbalanced patient population and a wide range of potential causes make the ability to correctly classify patients.
The moderating role of diabetes distress on the effect of a randomized eHealth intervention on glycemic control in Black adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,"Due to systemic inequities, Black adolescents with type 1 diabetes are more likely to have suboptimal glycemic control and high rates of diabetes distress, but tailored interventions for this population are lacking. In primary outcomes of a randomized clinical trial, a family-based eHealth intervention improved glycemic control in Black adolescents with type 1 diabetes and elevated depressive symptoms. The present study is a secondary analysis of these clinical trial data examining the moderating effect of diabetes distress on the efficacy of the intervention. Using secondary data from a multicenter randomized clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.gov [NCT03168867]), caregiver-adolescent dyads were randomly assigned to either up to three sessions of an eHealth parenting intervention (n = 75) or a standard medical care control group (n = 74). Black adolescents (10 years, 0 months to 14 years, 11 months old) with type 1 diabetes and a caregiver willing to participate were eligible. Adolescents reported their diabetes distress at baseline, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) data were collected at baseline, 6-, 13-, and 18-month follow-up. No between-group contrasts emerged in a linear mixed-effects regression (p's > .09). Within-group contrasts emerged such that adolescents assigned to the intervention who reported high diabetes distress had lower HbA1c at the 18-month follow-up relative to baseline (p = .004); the 18-month decrease in HbA1c was -1.03%. Black adolescents with type 1 diabetes and high levels of diabetes distress showed significant decreases in HbA1c following a family-based eHealth intervention, suggesting diabetes distress may be a key moderator of intervention efficacy within this population.",['Knauft KM; Jacques-Tiura AJ; Idalski Carcone A; Evans M; Weissberg-Benchell J; Buggs-Saxton C; Boucher-Berry C; Miller JL; Drossos T; Dekelbab B; Ellis DA'],2024,a family-based eHealth intervention improved glycemic control in black adolescents with type 1 diabetes. the intervention was randomly assigned to up to three sessions of an eHealth parenting intervention. a family-based eHealth intervention improved glycemic control in black adolescents with type 1 diabetes and elevated depressive symptoms.
A Review of Recent Advances in the Management of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative condition and a form of dementia encountered in medical practice. Despite many proposed and attempted treatments, this disease remains a major puzzle in the public health systems worldwide. The initial part of this article provides an overview and illustration of the primary mechanisms responsible for neuronal damage in AD. Subsequently, it offers a critical evaluation of the most noteworthy studies on pharmacological therapy for AD and outlines recent advancements and novel approaches to managing this condition. Main properties, categorization, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) status, mechanisms of action, benefits, and common side effects of the classical and the most recently proposed pharmacological treatments for AD are described. The conventional pharmacological agents revised comprise cholinesterase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and other therapies, such as memantine, valproic acid, and rosiglitazone. The innovative reviewed pharmacological agents comprise the monoclonal antibodies: donanemab, gantenerumab, solanezumab, bapineuzumab, crenezumab, and semorinemab. Nutritional supplements such as alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and caprylidene are also revised. Tau and amyloid-targeting treatments include methylthioninium moiety (MT), leuco-methylthioninium bis (LMTM), an oxidized form of MT, and tramiprosate, which inhibits the beta-amyloid (Aβ) monomer aggregation into toxic oligomers. Antidiabetic and anti-neuroinflammation drugs recently proposed for AD treatment are discussed. The antidiabetic drugs include NE3107, an anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizer, and the diabetes mainstream drug metformin. The anti-neuroinflammatory AD therapies include the use of sodium oligomannate (GV-971), infusions with intravenous immunoglobulin aiming to decrease plasma levels of the constituents of Aβ plaques, and masitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that impacts mast and microglia cells. Additional anti-inflammatory agents being currently tested in phase-2 clinical trials, such as atomoxetine (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), losartan (angiotensin 2 receptor agonist), genistein (anti-inflammatory isoflavone neuroprotective agent), trans-resveratrol (polyphenol antioxidant plant estrogen), and benfotiamine (synthetic thiamine precursor), were reviewed. Lastly, drugs targeting Alzheimer's-associated symptoms, such as brexpiprazole (serotonin dopamine activity modulator) and suvorexant (orexin receptor antagonist), respectively, used for agitation and insomnia in AD patients, are reviewed. As experimental investigations and clinical research progress, there is a possibility that a combination of newly tested medications and traditional ones may emerge as a promising treatment option for AD in the future.",['Thangwaritorn S; Lee C; Metchikoff E; Razdan V; Ghafary S; Rivera D; Pinto A; Pemminati S'],2024,"the first part of this article provides an overview and illustration of the primary mechanisms responsible for neuronal damage in AD. it offers a critical evaluation of the most noteworthy studies on pharmacological therapy for AD. the conventional pharmacological agents revised comprise the monoclonal antibodies: donanemab, gantenerumab, solanezumab, bapineuzumab, crenezumab, and semorinemab."
Five-alpha reductase inhibitors and risk of prostate cancer among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: A historical cohort study using primary care data.,"<b>Background:</b> Five-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) are used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 5ARIs prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is important in prostate development. It has been suggested that 5ARIs can be used a chemopreventative agent for prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of prostate cancer associated with 5ARI use among men with BPH. <b>Methods:</b> Using Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 1992 to 2011 in UK, prostate cancer risk was retrospectively compared in men with a new diagnosis of BPH, with no history of prostate cancer who were treated with 5ARIs, to men treated with alpha blockers (ABs) and those given no pharmacological treatment. Incidence rate of prostate cancer was calculated by treatment group; the association between BPH treatment group and prostate cancer was estimated by a multivariate Cox model. <b>Results:</b> 77,494 men with newly diagnosed BPH were included. The crude incidence rate of prostate cancer was 892.4 cases per 100,000 person-years amongst those treated with 5ARIs, compared with 1209.0 and 1542.9 in those treated with ABs and untreated individuals, respectively. The HR adjusted for potential confounders was 0.79 (0.72-0.86) for 5ARI vs ABs and 0.72 (0.66-0.79) for 5ARI vs untreated. After excluding the first year after BPH diagnosis, adjusted HRs attenuated to 0.87 (0.79-0.97) for 5ARI vs ABs and 0.97 (0.87-1.08) for 5ARI vs untreated. <b>Conclusion:</b> Among men diagnosed with BPH, we found evidence of lower risks of subsequent prostate cancer in those treated with 5ARIs, but this appeared to be driven by cases diagnosed within a year of BPH, possibly reflecting prevalent prostate cancers that were initially misdiagnosed. After excluding the first year after BPH diagnosis, there was little evidence of a reduced prostate cancer risk in those taking 5ARIs.",['Thakrar DB; Douglas IJ; Smeeth L; Bhaskaran K'],2023,5ARIs prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. it has been suggested that 5ARIs can be used a chemopreventative agent for prostate cancer.
Association of distal radial fracture with comorbidities: model development and validation.,"To better assess the risk of distal radial fracture in the general population, we need models that take into account a wide range of risk factors other than osteoporosis. The objective was to develop and validate a model for association of patients' characteristics with distal radial fracture that effectively incorporates multifactorial aspects and includes comorbidities. We analyzed data from a large Longitudinal Health Insurance Database between 2000 and 2013. The outcome of the study was the occurrence of distal radial fracture and the predictors were demographic and comorbidity data. Two machine learning models were developed and validated for patients ≥50 (N = 2745) and <50 (N = 1587) years of age. For patients aged ≥50 years, selected characteristics included sex, age, urbanization level, osteoarthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, obesity, hyperlipidemia, trigger finger, hypertension, hypothyroidism, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis. For patients <50 years old, selected characteristics included age, sex, diabetes mellitus, urbanization level, carpal tunnel syndrome, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, obesity, and hypertension. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, and likelihood ratio were 0.77, 0.83, 0.72, 0.77, and 2.92 for age ≥50 years and 0.73, 0.79, 0.67, 0.73, and 2.41 for age <50 years. The study models can serve as reliable screening tools to assess the risk of distal radial fracture in the general population before bone mineral density testing. In addition, they can be integrated into decision support systems to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients for additional evaluation and education, ultimately improving the quality of care.",['Shariatzadeh H; Dashtbozorg A; Gorjizadeh N'],2024,model for association of patients' characteristics with distal radial fracture. model combines multifactorial aspects and includes comorbidities. results of study were demographic and comorbidity data.
Apolipoprotein J protects cardiomyocytes from lipid-mediated inflammation and cytotoxicity induced by the epicardial adipose tissue of diabetic patients.,"Diabetic patients present increased volume and functional alterations in epicardial adipose tissue (EAT). We aimed to analyze EAT from type 2 diabetic patients and the inflammatory and cytotoxic effects induced on cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we analyzed the cardioprotective role of apolipoprotein J (apoJ). EAT explants were obtained from nondiabetic patients (ND), diabetic patients without coronary disease (DM), and DM patients with coronary disease (DM-C) after heart surgery. Morphological characteristics and gene expression were evaluated. Explants were cultured for 24 h and the content of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and sphingolipid species in secretomes was evaluated by lipidomic analysis. Afterwards, secretomes were added to AC16 human cardiomyocytes for 24 h in the presence or absence of cardioprotective molecules (apoJ and HDL). Cytokine release and apoptosis/necrosis were assessed by ELISA and flow cytometry. The EAT from the diabetic samples showed altered expression of genes related to lipid accumulation, insulin resistance, and inflammation. The secretomes from the DM samples presented an increased ratio of pro/antiatherogenic ceramide (Cer) species, while those from DM-C contained the highest concentration of saturated NEFA. DM and DM-C secretomes promoted inflammation and cytotoxicity on AC16 cardiomyocytes. Exogenous Cer16:0, Cer24:1, and palmitic acid reproduced deleterious effects in AC16 cells. These effects were attenuated by exogenous apoJ. Diabetic secretomes promoted inflammation and cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes. This effect was exacerbated in the secretomes of the DM-C samples. The increased content of specific NEFA and ceramide species seems to play a key role in inducing such deleterious effects, which are attenuated by apoJ.",['Puig N; Rives J; Gil-Millan P; Miñambres I; Ginel A; Tauron M; Bonaterra-Pastra A; Hernández-Guillamon M; Pérez A; Sánchez-Quesada JL; Benitez S'],2024,"EAT explants were obtained from nondiabetic patients (ND), diabetic patients without coronary disease (DM) and DM patients with coronary disease (DM-C) after heart surgery. lipidomic analysis compared secretomes to necrosis."

Pioglitazone-induced alterations of purine metabolism in healthy male subjects.,"Pioglitazone is class of thiazolidinediones that activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in adipocytes to improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and has been used as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. However, the underlying mechanisms of associated pioglitazone-induced effects remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate endogenous metabolite alterations associated with pioglitazone administration in healthy male subjects using an untargeted metabolomics approach. All subjects received 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily in the assigned sequence and period. Urine samples were collected before pioglitazone administration and for 24 h after 7 days of administration. A total of 1465 compounds were detected and filtered using a coefficient of variance below 30% and 108 metabolites were significantly altered upon pioglitazone administration via multivariate statistical analysis. Fourteen significant metabolites were identified using authentic standards and public libraries. Additionally, pathway analysis revealed that metabolites from purine and beta-alanine metabolisms were significantly altered after pioglitazone administration. Further analysis of quantification of metabolites from purine metabolism, revealed that the xanthine/hypoxanthine and uric acid/xanthine ratios were significantly decreased at post-dose. Pioglitazone-dependent endogenous metabolites and metabolic ratio indicated the potential effect of pioglitazone on the activation of PPAR and fatty acid synthesis.

Therapy-Related Satisfaction and Quality of Life for Japanese People with Diabetes Using Rapid-Acting Insulin Analogs: A Web-Based Survey.,"People with diabetes require insulin to regulate blood glucose (BG); rapid-acting insulin analogs (RAIA) represent one approach for BG management. New fast-acting RAIA administered at the start of a meal suppress postprandial BG better than conventional RAIA. New RAIA are expected to confer higher treatment satisfaction and improved quality of life (QOL) than conventional RAIA. This cross-sectional, web-based survey in Japan (November 2022) included people with diabetes (type 1/2), aged ≥ 18 years, registered in the Rakuten Insight Diabetes Panel, using new and/or conventional RAIA. RAIA-specific satisfaction was evaluated by questions on RAIA use (scores: 1 [not at all satisfied]; 7 [very satisfied]) and QOL by the Diabetes Therapy-Related (DTR)-QOL questionnaire (scores: 0-100, 100 = best) for the whole population (primary endpoint) and for new versus conventional RAIA users (secondary endpoint). Multiple regression models were used to compare new versus conventional RAIA users. The analysis population comprised 217 people with diabetes (new RAIA, n = 109; conventional RAIA, n = 108). Mean (standard deviation) RAIA-specific satisfaction scores ranged from 5.1 (1.2) to 5.4 (1.2); DTR-QOL total score was 51.6 (20.4). RAIA satisfaction scores were numerically higher for new versus conventional RAIA users; no difference in DTR-QOL total score was observed. DTR-QOL satisfaction with treatment domain score was significantly higher in new versus conventional RAIA users (least squares mean difference [standard error]: 7.3 [3.1]; 95% confidence interval: 1.2, 13.4; P = 0.0197). RAIA-specific satisfaction was higher among patients who discussed BG sufficiently with their doctor versus those who did not. New RAIA users have greater treatment satisfaction than conventional RAIA users. QOL was similar among new and conventional RAIA users, except for satisfaction with treatment, which was significantly higher among new RAIA users. Detailed explanations from the doctor to the person with diabetes about the relationship between new RAIA and BG status are essential.

Human papillomavirus circulating tumor DNA assays as a mechanism for head and neck cancer equity in rural regions of the United States.,"The rates of human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) are rising worldwide and in the United States, particularly in rural regions including Appalachia. Rural areas face unique health challenges resulting in higher cancer incidence and mortality rates, and this includes HPV-OPC. The recent advent of highly sensitive liquid biopsies for the non-invasive detection of HPV-OPC recurrence (circulating tumor HPV DNA, HPV ctDNA) has been swiftly adopted as part of surveillance paradigms. Though knowledge gaps persist regarding its use and clinical trials are ongoing, the ease of collection and cost-effectiveness of HPV ctDNA make it more accessible for HPV-OPC survivors than usual surveillance methods of frequent exams and imaging. Herein, we discuss how implementing HPV ctDNA assays in rural regions of the United States provide one poignant example of how liquid biopsies can improve cancer care equity.",['Windon M; Haring C'],2024,the rates of human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer (HPV-OPC) are rising worldwide and in the united states. rural areas face unique health challenges resulting in higher cancer incidence and mortality rates.
Association between recent exposure to continuous glucose monitoring-recorded hypoglycaemia and counterregulatory and symptom responses to subsequent controlled hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes.,"Experimental hypoglycaemia blunts the counterregulatory hormone and symptom responses to a subsequent episode of hypoglycaemia. In this study, we aimed to assess the associations between antecedent exposure and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-recorded hypoglycaemia during a 1-week period and the counterregulatory responses to subsequent experimental hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes. Forty-two people with type 1 diabetes (20 females, mean ± SD glycated haemoglobin 7.8% ± 1.0%, diabetes duration median (interquartile range) 22.0 (10.5-34.9) years, 29 CGM users, and 19 with impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia) wore an open intermittently scanned CGM for 1 week to detect hypoglycaemic exposure before a standardized hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic [2.8 ± 0.1 mmol/L (50.2 ± 2.3 mg/dl)] glucose clamp. Symptom responses and counterregulatory hormones were measured during the clamp. The study is part of the HypoRESOLVE project. CGM-recorded hypoglycaemia in the week before the clamp was negatively associated with adrenaline response [β -0.09, 95% CI (-0.16, -0.02) nmol/L, p = .014], after adjusting for CGM use, awareness of hypoglycaemia, glycated haemoglobin and total daily insulin dose.

Level of and factors associated with foot self-care among people with diabetes in Idlib Province of Northwest Syria: A cross-sectional study.,"Diabetic foot and lower limb problems are among the most neglected complications during the Syrian armed conflict due to the absence of a functioning health infrastructure, including early detection and timely management of limb-threatening wounds. This study aimed to determine self-reported diabetes-related foot disease (DRFD), adherence to recommended foot self-care (FSC) practices, and associated factors among people with diabetes in war-torn Northwest Syria (NWS). This was a cross-sectional study conducted at six primary care clinics in Idlib, NWS, between March 27 and April 17, 2022, utilizing the validated interviewer-administered Diabetes Foot Disease and Foot Care Questionnaire. Data on demographic characteristics, DRFD, and FSC practices were collected. FSC score was determined by adding the points from all 12 FSC items, with a maximum score of 48, and were categorized into very poor (≤12), poor (13-24), moderate (25-36), and good (37-48). A convenience sample of 331 consecutive Syrians, aged ≥18 years, with diabetes, were invited. Multiple linear regression was used to identify variables associated with FSC practices. A total of 328 patients completed the questionnaire (response rate: 99.1%). The overall FSC score was average (mean total score 27.24, SD 7.03). Over one-third (37.8%) had a very poor/poor score, 50.3% had an average score, and 11.9% had a good score.

Adolescent- and adult-onset neuroblastic tumor: A retrospective multicenter observational study of patients diagnosed in France between 2000 and 2020.,"Adult- and adolescent-onset neuroblastomas are rare, with no established therapy. In addition, rare pheochromocytomas may harbor neuroblastic components. This study was designed to collect epidemiological, diagnostic and therapeutic data in order to better define the characteristics of malignant peripheral neuroblastic tumors (MPNT) and composite pheochromocytomas (CP) with MPNT. Fifty-nine adults and adolescents (aged over 15 years) diagnosed with a peripheral or composite neuroblastic tumor, who were treated in one of 17 institutions between 2000 and 2020, were retrospectively studied. Eighteen patients with neuroblastoma (NB) or ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB) had locoregional disease, and 28 patients had metastatic stage 4 NB. Among the 13 patients with CP, 12 had locoregional disease. Fifty-eight percent of the population were adolescents and young adults under 24 years of age. The probability of 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 40% (confidence interval: 27%-53%). Outcomes were better for patients with localized tumor than for patients with metastases. For patients with localized tumor, in terms of survival, surgical treatment was the best therapeutic option. Multimodal treatment with chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy-based maintenance allowed long-term survival for some patients. Adolescent- and adult-onset neuroblastoma appeared to have specific characteristics associated with poorer outcomes compared to pediatric neuroblastoma. Nevertheless, complete disease control improved survival. The presence of a neuroblastic component in pheochromocytoma should be considered when making therapeutic management decisions. The development of specific tools/resources (Tumor Referral Board, Registry, biology, and trials with new agents or strategies) may help to improve outcomes for patients.",['Magnier O; Schiff I; Cristante J; Chabre O; Veloso M; Bosson JL; Defachelles AS; Cordero C; Cao CD; Thebaud E; Drui D; Berlanga P; Dumont B; Chastagner P; Tandonnet J; Gambart M; Jannier S; Pluchart C; Andry L; Laithier V; Klein S; Carausu L; Akbaraly T; Probert J; Habert-Dantigny R; Plantaz D'],2024,"adolescent-onset neuroblastomas are rare, with no established therapy. pheochromocytomas may harbor neuroblastic components. adolescent- and adult-onset neuroblastoma appeared to have specific characteristics associated with poorer outcomes compared to pediatric neuroblastoma."
Elevated thyroid stimulating hormone and metabolic syndrome risk in patients with first-episode and drug-naïve major depressive disorder: a large-scale cross-sectional study.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is common in major depressive disorder (MDD), but its relationship with thyroid hormones remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association of thyroid hormones and MetS in first-episode drug-naïve (FEDN) MDD patients. We recruited 1718 unmedicated MDD patients in this cross-sectional study. MetS was defined based on the 2004 Chinese Diabetes Society Criteria. Serum thyroid hormones including free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), and anti-thyroglobulin (TGAb) were examined. We used the logistic regression model to determine risk factors for MetS and examined the performance of the regression model by using the Area Under the Curve (AUC). In addition, we performed the trend test to test whether the results were robust. The prevalence of MetS in unmedicated MDD patients was 34.4%. MDD patients with MetS had higher levels of serum TSH, TGAb, and TPOAb (all P < 0.001). Concurrently, serum TSH levels were independent risk factors for MetS in MDD patients (OR:1.49, 95%CI: 1.40-1.58), which could also distinguish MDD patients with and without MetS (AUC was 0.77). Additionally, in the trend test, the results also indicated a similar trend when TSH was used as a categorical variable (P for trend < 0.001). This study suggests that TSH levels were independent risk factors for MetS in FEDN MDD patients (OR:1.49).

Aberrant expression of NEDD4L disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis by downregulating CaMKKβ in diabetic kidney disease.,"Disturbance in mitochondrial homeostasis within proximal tubules is a critical characteristic associated with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). CaMKKβ/AMPK signaling plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. Despite the downregulation of CaMKKβ in DKD pathology, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The expression of NEDD4L, which is primarily localized to renal proximal tubules, is significantly upregulated in the renal tubules of mice with DKD. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays revealed a physical interaction between NEDD4L and CaMKKβ. Moreover, deletion of NEDD4L under high glucose conditions prevented rapid CaMKKβ protein degradation. In vitro studies revealed that the aberrant expression of NEDD4L negatively influences the protein stability of CaMKKβ. This study also explored the role of NEDD4L in DKD by using AAV-shNedd4L in db/db mice. These findings confirmed that NEDD4L inhibition leads to a decrease in urine protein excretion, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that si-Nedd4L suppressed mitochondrial fission and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, effects antagonized by si-CaMKKβ. In summary, the findings provided herein provide strong evidence that dysregulated NEDD4L disturbs mitochondrial homeostasis by negatively modulating CaMKKβ in the context of DKD. This evidence underscores the potential of therapeutic interventions targeting NEDD4L and CaMKKβ to safeguard renal tubular function in the management of DKD.",['Han F; Wu S; Dong Y; Liu Y; Sun B; Chen L'],2024,NEDD4L is upregulated in the renal tubules of mice with DKD.

Standalone deep learning versus experts for diagnosis lung cancer on chest computed tomography: a systematic review.,"To compare the diagnostic performance of standalone deep learning (DL) algorithms and human experts in lung cancer detection on chest computed tomography (CT) scans. This study searched for studies on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from their inception until November 2023. We focused on adult lung cancer patients and compared the efficacy of DL algorithms and expert radiologists in disease diagnosis on CT scans. Quality assessment was performed using QUADAS-2, QUADAS-C, and CLAIM. Bivariate random-effects and subgroup analyses were performed for tasks (malignancy classification vs invasiveness classification), imaging modalities (CT vs low-dose CT [LDCT] vs high-resolution CT), study region, software used, and publication year. We included 20 studies on various aspects of lung cancer diagnosis on CT scans. Quantitatively, DL algorithms exhibited superior sensitivity (82%) and specificity (75%) compared to human experts (sensitivity 81%, specificity 69%). However, the difference in specificity was statistically significant, whereas the difference in sensitivity was not statistically significant. The DL algorithms' performance varied across different imaging modalities and tasks, demonstrating the need for tailored optimization of DL algorithms. Notably, DL algorithms matched experts in sensitivity on standard CT, surpassing them in specificity, but showed higher sensitivity with lower specificity on LDCT scans. DL algorithms demonstrated improved accuracy over human readers in malignancy and invasiveness classification on CT scans. However, their performance varies by imaging modality, underlining the importance of continued research to fully assess DL algorithms' diagnostic effectiveness in lung cancer. DL algorithms have the potential to refine lung cancer diagnosis on CT, matching human sensitivity and surpassing in specificity. These findings call for further DL optimization across imaging modalities, aiming to advance clinical diagnostics and patient outcomes. Lung cancer diagnosis by CT is challenging and can be improved with AI integration. DL shows higher accuracy in lung cancer detection on CT than human experts. Enhanced DL accuracy could lead to improved lung cancer diagnosis and outcomes.",['Wang TW; Hong JS; Chiu HY; Chao HS; Chen YM; Wu YT'],2024,DL algorithms and human experts in lung cancer detection on CT scans were compared. sensitivity was 82%) and specificity (75%) compared to human experts.

Acute Interstitial Nephritis and Oxalate Nephropathy After Rapid Pasireotide Response in Treatment-resistant Acromegaly.,"We report a case of interstitial nephritis, likely secondary to oxalate nephropathy, due to the development of pancreatic exocrine dysfunction after commencement of pasireotide for acromegaly. Pasireotide is known to impair insulin secretion but can also impair pancreatic exocrine function, hypothezised to result from high-affinity binding of somatostatin receptors 1, 2, 3, and 5. This has been an advantage in postoperative tissue anastomoses after pancreatic surgery, but exocrine insufficiency has not been reported when used for the treatment of acromegaly. A 73-year-old woman, diagnosed with acromegaly, was unable to achieve biochemical control despite 2 surgical resections of an invasive mammosomatotroph pituitary tumor and treatment with cabergoline and maximal-dose lanreotide. The tumor expressed somatostatin receptor type 5 but not somatostatin receptor type 2, predicting good response from pasireotide, which was commenced at 40 mg every 4 weeks. IGF-1 rapidly normalized, but the patient presented with nausea, anorexia, and acute kidney injury. Renal biopsy revealed acute-on-chronic interstitial nephritis, with numerous oxalate crystals. Increased fecal fat globules were noted on fat stain (3+), supporting malabsorption as an etiology of secondary enteric hyperoxaluria.

Model of micro-metastases of breast cancer cells in ovarian tissue: cryopreservation of ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells with increased speed of warming increases malignancy.,"In medicine, ovarian tissue cryopreservation exists for fertility preservation of cancer patients. In fact, ovarian tissue frozen for subsequent thawing and re-transplantation can be contaminated with cancer cells. Therefore, investigations on the effect of cryopreservation on the post-thawed viability of such cells are relevant. Speed of warming is a key parameter of cell cryopreservation. However, the data about comparative viability of cancer cells cryopreserved with different parameters of warming are limited. The aim of our investigations was to assess the malignancy of cryopreserved cancer cells after conventional cooling followed by relatively slow and quick speed of warming. In vitro cultured breast cancer cells of lines ZR-75-1 and MD0MD-231 in form of compacted fragments (as a model of solid tumors) were frozen following a protocol usually used for freezing of ovarian tissue (6% ethylene glycol+6% glycerol+0.15M sucrose, -0.3°C/min). Cells were warmed by two routine regimes of warming: at 37°C (""slow"" warming) and 100°C (""quick"" warming). Biological properties of cells were investigated: viability, proliferation rate, 2D- and 3D-migration, transmembrane movement and invasion. Quick warming at 100°C in comparison with slow warming at 37°C exhibited significantly higher cell survival for MDA-MB-231 cells: 70.1% vs. 63.2% and for ZR-75-1 86.8% vs. 82.9%, respectively. The cell motility including 2D movement and 3D transmembrane migration were higher after quick thawing at 100°C. Invasive abilities of cells after cryopreservation were higher than that of fresh (non-treated cells). Both thawing regimes showed a similar rate of cell proliferation. Cryopreservation procedures, and especially this one with quick thawing, increase malignancy of ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and risk of metastasis.

Impact of an Automated Population-Level Cirrhosis Screening Program Using Common Pathology Tests on Rates of Cirrhosis Diagnosis and Linkage to Specialist Care (CAPRISE): Protocol for a Pilot Prospective Single-Arm Intervention Study.,"People with compensated cirrhosis receive the greatest benefit from risk factor modification and prevention programs to reduce liver decompensation and improve early liver cancer detection. Blood-based liver fibrosis algorithms such as the Aspartate Transaminase-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index are calculated using routinely ordered blood tests and are effective screening tests to exclude cirrhosis in people with chronic liver disease, triaging the need for further investigations to confirm cirrhosis and linkage to specialist care. This pilot study aims to evaluate the impact of a population screening program for liver cirrhosis (CAPRISE [Cirrhosis Automated APRI and FIB-4 Screening Evaluation]), which uses automated APRI and FIB-4 calculation and reporting on routinely ordered blood tests, on monthly rates of referral for transient elastography, cirrhosis diagnosis, and linkage to specialist care. We have partnered with a large pathology service in Victoria, Australia, to pilot a population-level liver cirrhosis screening package, which comprises (1) automated calculation and reporting of APRI and FIB-4 on routinely ordered blood tests; (2) provision of brief information about liver cirrhosis; and (3) a web link for transient elastography referral. APRI and FIB-4 will be prospectively calculated on all community-ordered pathology results in adults attending a single pathology service. This single-center, prospective, single-arm, pre-post study will compare the monthly rates of transient elastography (FibroScan) referral, liver cirrhosis diagnosis, and the proportion linked to specialist care in the 6 months after intervention to the 6 months prior to the intervention. As of January 2024, in the preintervention phase of this study, a total of 120,972 tests were performed by the laboratory. Of these tests, 78,947 (65.3%) tests were excluded, with the remaining 42,025 (34.7%) tests on 37,872 individuals meeting inclusion criteria with APRI and FIB-4 being able to be calculated. Of these 42,025 tests, 1.3% (n=531) had elevated APRI>1 occurring in 446 individuals, and 2.3% (n=985) had elevated FIB-4>2.67 occurring in 816 individuals. Linking these data with FibroScan referral and appointment attendance is ongoing and will continue during the intervention phase, which is expected to commence on February 1, 2024. We will determine the feasibility and effectiveness of automated APRI and FIB-4 reporting on the monthly rate of transient elastography referrals, liver cirrhosis diagnosis, and linkage to specialist care.

Semi-supervised skin cancer diagnosis based on self-feedback threshold focal learning.,"Worldwide, skin cancer prevalence necessitates accurate diagnosis to alleviate public health burdens. Although the application of artificial intelligence in image analysis and pattern recognition has improved the accuracy and efficiency of early skin cancer diagnosis, existing supervised learning methods are limited due to their reliance on a large amount of labeled data. To overcome the limitations of data labeling and enhance the performance of diagnostic models, this study proposes a semi-supervised skin cancer diagnostic model based on Self-feedback Threshold Focal Learning (STFL), capable of utilizing partial labeled and a large scale of unlabeled medical images for training models in unseen scenarios. The proposed model dynamically adjusts the selection threshold of unlabeled samples during training, effectively filtering reliable unlabeled samples and using focal learning to mitigate the impact of class imbalance in further training. The study is experimentally validated on the HAM10000 dataset, which includes images of various types of skin lesions, with experiments conducted across different scales of labeled samples. With just 500 annotated samples, the model demonstrates robust performance (0.77 accuracy, 0.6408 Kappa, 0.77 recall, 0.7426 precision, and 0.7462 F1-score), showcasing its efficiency with limited labeled data. Further, comprehensive testing validates the semi-supervised model's significant advancements in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the value of integrating unlabeled data.

Eighty-four amputations were reviewed in a retrospective fashion. A retrospective medical record review was performed to determine patients who underwent a hallux amputation, both partial and complete, and patients who underwent a partial first-ray amputation. Only patients from 2007 to 2019 were reviewed. The reulceration rate of hallux amputations was 61% compared with a partial first-ray amputation reulceration rate of 74%. The reamputation rate of hallux amputation versus partial first-ray amputation was 43% versus 51%. At final follow-up, it was statistically significant that patients who underwent hallux amputation were more likely to be healed than those who underwent partial first-ray amputation, regardless of reulceration or reamputation. In addition, patients who underwent hallux amputation went on to digital amputation, and those who underwent partial first-ray amputation went on to transmetatarsal amputation. Comparing partial first-ray amputation to hallux amputation, hallux amputation patients are more prone to subsequent digital ulceration. Patients who initially undergo hallux amputation have variable subsequent amputations, often digital. Reulceration primarily occurs at the incision site for partial first-ray amputations, with a higher likelihood of subsequent transmetatarsal amputation. Patients with a medical history of diabetes and staged procedures are more likely to receive partial first-ray amputations. However, hallux amputation patients have a lower risk of reulceration and reamputation, regardless of subsequent events. These findings underscore the importance of discussing risks and preventive measures with patients undergoing such amputations, emphasizing postoperative examinations for specific areas of concern. Hallux amputation appears to offer greater protection against reulceration and reamputation for both diabetic and nondiabetic populations.",['Hughes HJ; Hurst MJ; Burns PR'],2024,"a retrospective medical record review was performed to determine patients who underwent a hallux amputation, both partial and complete, and patients who underwent a partial first-ray amputation. only patients from 2007 to 2019 were reviewed."
Limb salvage and systemic management of gouty tophi: Case series.,"Gout is a chronic disease characterized by deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Tophi develop in some individuals with untreated or uncontrolled gout, which leads to ulcerations, cosmetic problems, mechanical obstruction of joint movement, joint damage and musculoskeletal disability. Currently, the treatment of gouty tophi is controversial and challenging. Both surgical and internal medical treatments have limitations and require further exploration in clinical practice. In Case 1, we treated a patient with severe infection of diabetic foot ulcers with concomitant multiple gouty tophi in the same limb. A systematic management strategy was formulated to close the wound and save the limb. The ulcers healed successfully after half a year. In Case 2, a giant gouty tophi located in the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot was removed by surgical treatment and vancomycin-loaded bone cement implantation. In Case 3, we present a case of gouty tophi that was resolved by standardized systemic medical management. Three patients were all diagnosed with gout accompanied by gouty deposition, although there were other different comorbidities. In case 1, we used debridement to gradually remove gouty tophi. In case 2, the giant gouty tophi was removed by surgical operation. In case 3, the gouty tophi disappeared after standardized treatment with medicine, diet and lifestyle management. Three patients underwent different treatment therapies to remove gouty tophi based on their specific conditions. We explored effective interventions for tophi in gout by surgical or other interventions in combination with pharmacotherapy.",['Jiang X; Li A; Hao W; Yang C; Wang H; Deng W'],2024,gouty tophi develops in individuals with untreated or uncontrolled gout. gouty tophi is characterized by deposition of monosodium urate crystals. gouty tophi is a chronic disease characterized by deposition of monosodium urate crystals.
Cytologic Parameters in Predicting the Outcome of Atypical Glandular Cells on Papanicolaou Smears: A Single-Institutional Experience.,"Atypical glandular cells (AGCs) diagnosis on Pap (Papanicolaou) smears are uncommon and may represent various benign and malignant lesions. This study aims to report the incidence of AGC on Pap smear, to study the relationship of AGC with malignancy, and to determine cytomorphological features that help in predicting malignancy. Retrospective analytical study conducted in the Department of Oncopathology at Tertiary Cancer and Research Institute. In this retrospective study, we included cases diagnosed with AGC between July 2017 to July 2022. All slides were reviewed and subclassified according to the Bethesda 2014 classification system (TBS). The predetermined cytomorphological features observed in the smears were recorded. The follow-up histopathological diagnoses of the cases were retrieved. The significant cytomorphological and clinicopathological findings for malignancy were determined.

The significant cytomorphological features observed in neoplastic cases were cells in 3-dimensional clusters, nuclear overlapping, reniform nucleus, irregular nuclear membrane, increased nuclear size, single macronucleoli, engulfed neutrophils, and prominently vacuolated cytoplasm. The diagnosis of AGC on cytology is associated with clinically significant lesions, and cytomorphologic parameters can be used to predict the benign and malignant outcome.",['Phalak PA; Shah MG; Kapoor S; Goswami SJ; Samanta ST; Trivedi PP'],2024,atypical glandular cells (AGCs) diagnosis on Pap (Papanicolaou) smears are uncommon and may represent various benign and malignant lesions. this study aims to report the incidence of AGC on Pap smear.
Lactylproteome analysis indicates histone H4K12 lactylation as a novel biomarker in triple-negative breast cancer.,"The established link between posttranslational modifications of histone and non-histone lysine (K) residues in cell metabolism, and their role in cancer progression, is well-documented. However, the lactylation expression signature in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains underexplored. We conducted a comprehensive lactylproteome profiling of eight pairs of TNBC samples and their matched adjacent tissues. This was achieved through 4-Dimensional label-free quantitative proteomics combined with lactylation analysis (4D-LFQP-LA). The expression of identified lactylated proteins in TNBC was detected using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with specific primary antibodies, and their clinicopathological and prognostic significance was evaluated. Our analysis identified 58 lactylation sites on 48 proteins, delineating the protein lactylation alteration signature in TNBC. Bioinformatic and functional analyses indicated that these lactylated proteins play crucial roles in regulating key biological processes in TNBC. Notably, lactylation of lysine at position 12 (H4K12lac) in the histone H4 domain was found to be upregulated in TNBC. Further investigations showed a high prevalence of H4K12lac upregulation in TNBC, with positive rates of 93.19% (137/147) and 92.93% (92/99) in TNBC tissue chip and validation cohorts, respectively. H4K12lac expression correlated positively with Ki-67 and inversely with overall survival (OS) in TNBC (HR [hazard ratio] =2.813, 95%CI [credibility interval]: 1.242-6.371, <i>P</i>=0.0164), suggesting its potential as an independent prognostic marker (HR=3.477, 95%CI: 1.324-9.130, <i>P</i>=0.011). Lactylation is a significant post-translational modification in TNBC proteins. H4K12lac emerges as a promising biomarker for TNBC, offering insights into the lactylation profiles of TNBC proteins and linking histone modifications to clinical implications in TNBC.",['Cui Z; Li Y; Lin Y; Zheng C; Luo L; Hu D; Chen Y; Xiao Z; Sun Y'],2024,lactylation expression signature in triple-negative breast cancer remains underexplored. lysine at position 12 (H4K12lac) in the histone H4 domain was found to be upregulated in TNBC.
Cost-Effectiveness of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening for Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic Patients: A Nationwide Population-based Propensity Score-Matched Cohort Study.,"This study investigated the association between the frequency of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) versus the development of DR and corresponding medical expenses among patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This longitudinal, population-based study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (2004 to 2020) as a data source. Propensity score matching (PSM) (sex, age, comorbidities and concurrent medication use) was employed in the grouping of T2DM patients according to different frequency of DR screening. Outcome measures included the proportion of patients who developed DR, who received DR treatment, and the associated medical expenses and hospitalizations. The 17-year cohort included 337,046 patients. After PSM, three groups each containing 35,739 patients were assembled and analyzed. Compared to low-frequency screening, high-frequency screening was more effective in detecting patients requiring treatment; however, the net cost for treatment was significantly lower. Standard-frequency screening appears to provide the best balance in terms of DR detection, diagnosis interval, the risk of DR-related hospitalization, and DR treatment costs. In this real-world cohort study covering all levels of the healthcare system, infrequent screening was associated with delayed diagnosis and elevated treatment costs, while a fundus screening interval of 1-2 years proved optimal in terms of detection and medical expenditures.",['Chung YC; Kao YW; Huang YC; Chen PE; Liao SC; Liu CK; Chen M'],2024,study investigated association between frequency of screening for DR versus development of DR and corresponding medical expenses among patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
"Prescribing semaglutide for weight loss in non-diabetic, obese patients is associated with an increased risk of erectile dysfunction: a TriNetX database study.","Semaglutide was approved in June 2021 for weight loss in non-diabetic, obese patients. While package inserts include sexual dysfunction as a side effect, no study has assessed the degree of this risk. The objective of our study is to assess the risk of developing erectile dysfunction after semaglutide is prescribed for weight loss in obese, non-diabetic men. The TriNetX Research database was used to identify men without a diagnosis of diabetes ages 18 to 50 with BMI > 30 who were prescribed semaglutide after June 1st, 2021. Men were excluded if they had a prior erectile dysfunction diagnosis, any phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors prescription, intracavernosal injections, penile prosthesis placement, history of testosterone deficiency, testosterone prescription, pelvic radiation, radical prostatectomy, pulmonary hypertension, or were deceased. We further restricted our cohort to non-diabetic, obese men by excluding men with a prior diabetes mellitus diagnosis, a hemoglobin A1c > 6.5%, or having ever received insulin or metformin. Men were then stratified into cohorts of those that did and did not receive a semaglutide prescription. The primary outcome was the risk of new ED diagnosis and/or new prescription of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors at least one month after prescription of semaglutide. The secondary outcome was risk of testosterone deficiency diagnosis. Risk was reported using risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). 3,094 non-diabetic, obese men ages 18-50 who received a prescription of semaglutide were identified and subsequently matched to an equal number cohort of non-diabetic, obese men who never received a prescription of semaglutide. After matching, average age at index prescription for non-diabetic, obese men was 37.8 ± 7.8 and average BMI at index prescription was 38.6 ± 5.6. Non-diabetic men prescribed semaglutide were significantly more likely to develop erectile dysfunction and/or were prescribed phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (1.47% vs 0.32%; RR: 4.5; 95% CI [2.3, 9.0]) and testosterone deficiency (1.53% vs 0.80%; RR: 1.9; 95% CI [1.2, 3.1]) when compared to the control cohort of non-diabetic men who never received a semaglutide prescription.",['Able C; Liao B; Saffati G; Maremanda A; Applewhite J; Nasrallah AA; Sonstein J; Alzweri L; Kohn TP'],2024,semaglutide was approved in 2021 for weight loss in non-diabetic men. no study has assessed the degree of this risk. men excluded if they had a prior erectile dysfunction diagnosis.
"Primary health care preparedness to integrate diabetes care in Blantyre, Malawi: A mixed methods study.","There is limited access to diabetes care services at primary care facilities in Malawi. Assessing the capacity of facilities to provide diabetes care is an initial step to integrating services at primary care. To assess the preparedness for delivering diabetes services at primary care level within the Blantyre District Health Office (DHO) to support the response to NCD epidemic in Malawi. Blantyre DHO primary care facilities. A mixed methods approach nested in a national needs assessment for NCD response in Malawi was used. Fourteen primary healthcare facilities from Blantyre DHO were assessed. A tool adapted from the WHO rapid assessment questionnaire was used to identify human resource, equipment, supplies, and medication needed for comprehensive diabetes care. Descriptive statistics were done to analyze the quantitative data. Fisher's exact test was used to assess if there was a statistically significant difference between urban and rural facilities. Seventeen health care workers from the selected facilities participated in key informant interviews. Framework analysis method guided the qualitative data analysis. The quantitative and qualitative data were merged and displayed jointly. The quantitative assessment showed that none of the facilities assessed had capacity to provide all the interventions recommended by WHO for diabetes care at primary level. Eight (57%) of the facilities had the capacity to diagnose diabetes, monitor glucose, prevent limb amputations and manage hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: differences in level of preparedness and implementation of diabetes care; disparities in resources between urban and rural facilities; low utilization of diabetes services; and strategy and policy recommendations for improvement of diabetes care. Inadequate health financing resulted in significant disparities in the available resources between the rural and urban facilities to offer diabetes care services. There is need to develop national policies and guidelines for diabetes care to strengthen the capacity of primary care facilities to facilitate achievement of universal health coverage.",['K Banda C; Banda NPK; Gombachika BT; Nyirenda MJ; Hosseinipour MC; Muula AS'],2024,fourteen primary healthcare facilities from Blantyre DHO were assessed. a mixed methods approach was used to assess the preparedness for delivering diabetes care at primary care level.
GDF11 improves hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive abilities in diabetic mice by reducing neural inflammation.,"The cognitive decline associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is often attributed to compromised hippocampal neurogenesis and exacerbated neural inflammation. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) in reversing these neurodegenerative processes in diabetic mice. We utilized a murine model of T2D and examined the effects of GDF11 on learning, memory, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammatory markers. Our results indicate that diabetic mice exhibit significant deficits in cognitive function, mirrored by reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and increased neuroinflammation. Chronic administration of GDF11 was observed to significantly enhance cognitive abilities, as evidenced by improved performance in learning and memory tasks. Concurrently, GDF11 treatment restored neural activity and promoted the regeneration of new neurons within the hippocampus. Inflammatory profiling revealed a reduction in neuroinflammatory markers, which was further supported by reduced microglia numbers. To delineate the role of neuroinflammation, we pharmacologically depleted microglia, leading to a restoration of neurogenesis and cognitive functions in diabetic mice. These findings endorse the hypothesis that GDF11 exerts its beneficial effects by modulating neuroinflammatory pathways. Consequently, GDF11 represents a promising intervention to ameliorate diabetes-induced cognitive impairments and neural degeneration through its anti-inflammatory properties.",['Xing Y; Ma X; Zhai R; Chen W; Yan H'],2024,"diabetes-induced cognitive decline is often attributed to compromised hippocampal neurogenesis and exacerbated neural inflammation. the study examined the effects of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) on learning, memory, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammatory markers."
Measuring serum oestrogen levels in breast cancer survivors using vaginal oestrogens: a systematic review.,"Vaginal oestrogens can be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in women with early breast cancer. Studies evaluating vaginal oestrogens have commonly measured serum oestrogen levels as a surrogate marker of safety, but methods vary. We sought to summarise the data on serum oestrogen measurement in women with breast cancer using vaginal oestrogens to better understand the methods, levels and reliability. We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, SCOPUS and CINAHL from inception to October 2023 for clinical studies where serum oestrogen was measured in women with a history of early breast cancer using vaginal oestrogens. Studies with a reported testing methodology were included. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Methods used to measure oestradiol and oestriol in selected studies included mass spectrometry and immunoassays; several studies used more than one with variable concordance. Mass spectrometry detected oestradiol levels down to a lower limit between 1.0 pg/mL and 3.0 pg/mL. Immunoassays such as ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), ECLIA (enhanced chemiluminiscence immunoassay) and RIA (radioimmunoassay) had lower detection limits ranging between 0.8 pg/mL and 10 pg/mL. Studies were heterogeneous in testing techniques used, timing of testing, and the population including with subsequent varying results in the effect on oestrogens reported. Adopting consistent and standardised methods of measuring oestrogens in clinical trials involving women with early breast cancer on vaginal oestrogens is critical. Serum oestrogens are used as a surrogate marker of safety in this population, and good-quality data are necessary to enable clinicians and patients to feel confident in prescribing and taking vaginal oestrogens. Mass spectrometry, although more expensive, gives more reliable results when dealing with very low levels of oestrogens often found in women on aromatase inhibitors, compared to immunoassays.",['Pearson A; Chen J; Dhillon HM; Kiely BE'],2024,"studies evaluating vaginal oestrogens have commonly measured serum oestrogen levels as a surrogate marker of safety. but methods vary. we searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CENTRAL, SCOPUS and CINAHL."
Phase I and Randomized Phase II Study of Ruxolitinib With Frontline Neoadjuvant Therapy in Advanced Ovarian Cancer: An NRG Oncology Group Study.,"The interleukin-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 axis is a reported driver of chemotherapy resistance. We hypothesized that adding the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib to standard chemotherapy would be tolerable and improve progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with ovarian cancer in the upfront setting. Patients with ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal carcinoma recommended for neoadjuvant chemotherapy were eligible. In phase I, treatment was initiated with dose-dense paclitaxel (P) 70 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once daily on days 1, 8, and 15; carboplatin AUC 5 intravenously day 1; and ruxolitinib 15 mg orally (PO) twice a day, every 21 days (dose level 1). Interval debulking surgery (IDS) was required after cycle 3. Patients then received three additional cycles of chemotherapy/ruxolitinib, followed by maintenance ruxolitinib. In the randomized phase II, patients were randomly assigned to paclitaxel/carboplatin with or without ruxolitinib at 15 mg PO twice a day for three cycles, IDS, followed by another three cycles of chemotherapy/ruxolitinib, without further maintenance ruxolitinib. The primary phase II end point was PFS. Seventeen patients were enrolled in phase I. The maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose were established to be dose level 1. One hundred thirty patients were enrolled in phase II with a median follow-up of 24 months. The regimen was well tolerated, with a trend toward higher grade 3 to 4 anemia (64% <i>v</i> 27%), grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (53% <i>v</i> 37%), and thromboembolic events (12.6% <i>v</i> 2.4%) in the experimental arm.

Life-cycle-coupled evolution of mitosis in close relatives of animals.,"Eukaryotes have evolved towards one of two extremes along a spectrum of strategies for remodelling the nuclear envelope during cell division: disassembling the nuclear envelope in an open mitosis or constructing an intranuclear spindle in a closed mitosis<sup>1,2</sup>. Both classes of mitotic remodelling involve key differences in the core division machinery but the evolutionary reasons for adopting a specific mechanism are unclear. Here we use an integrated comparative genomics and ultrastructural imaging approach to investigate mitotic strategies in Ichthyosporea, close relatives of animals and fungi. We show that species in this clade have diverged towards either a fungal-like closed mitosis or an animal-like open mitosis, probably to support distinct multinucleated or uninucleated states.

Impact of metabolic bariatric surgery on outcomes and the 10-year risk of major adverse cardiovascular events during a 7-year period: a retrospective cohort study.,"Metabolic bariatric surgery offers enduring weight reduction and alleviation of obesity-related comorbidities, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Long-term data on one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) and single-anastomosis duodenal-jejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADJB-SG) is lacking, necessitating this investigation. In this multicenter prospectively-collected retrospective observational study, 830 adult Taiwanese patients (682 OAGB, 148 SADJB-SG) who underwent surgery from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2017, were initially identified. Following protocol, 224 patients (177 OAGB, 47 SADJB-SG) with complete follow-up data at various intervals up to three years after surgery were included in the final analysis. The study's primary focus is to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and durability of OAGB and SADJB-SG in promoting weight loss and diabetes remission. Additionally, changes in 10-year and lifetime risks of MACE before and 3-year after surgery are assessed using Taiwan MACE risk prediction model and the China-PAR project model. SADJB-SG patients exhibit higher diabetes prevalence, lower body mass index, and more severe diabetes compared to OAGB. Both groups demonstrate significant improvements in body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia three years after surgery, with the most substantial improvements occurring in the second year. The Taiwan MACE risk model reveals a significant reduction in 10-year MACE and stroke risks for both groups.

Role of macrophage in ocular neovascularization.,"Ocular neovascularization is the leading cause of blindness in clinical settings. Pathological angiogenesis of the eye can be divided into corneal neovascularization (CoNV), retinal neovascularization (RNV, including diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity), and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) based on the anatomical location of abnormal neovascularization. Although anti-Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents have wide-ranging clinical applications and are an effective treatment for neovascular eye disease, many deficiencies in this treatment strategy remain. Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that macrophages are vital during the process of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Monocyte-macrophage lineage is diverse and plastic, they can shift between different activation modes and have different functions. Due to the obvious regulatory effect of macrophages on inflammation and angiogenesis, macrophages have been increasingly studied in the field of ophthalmology. Here, we detail how macrophage activated and the role of different subtypes of macrophages in the pathogenesis of ocular neovascularization. The complexity of macrophages has recently taken center stage owing to their subset diversity and tightly regulated molecular and metabolic phenotypes. In this review, we reveal the functional and phenotypic characterization of macrophage subsets associated with ocular neovascularization, more in-depth research is needed to explore the specific mechanisms by which macrophages regulate angiogenesis as well as macrophage polarization.

"Oleogels for the ocular delivery of epalrestat: formulation, in vitro, in ovo, ex vivo and in vivo evaluation.","The ocular administration of lipophilic and labile drugs such as epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor with potential for diabetic retinopathy treatment, demands the development of topical delivery systems capable of providing sufficient ocular bioavailability. The aim of this work was to develop non-aqueous oleogels based on soybean oil and gelators from natural and sustainable sources (ethyl cellulose, beeswax and cocoa butter) and to assess their reproducibility, safety and efficiency in epalrestat release and permeation both ex vivo and in vivo. Binary combinations of gelators at 10% w/w resulted in solid oleogels (oleorods), while single gelator oleogels at 5% w/w remained liquid at room temperature, with most of the oleogels displaying shear thinning behavior. The oleorods released up to 4 µg epalrestat per mg of oleorod in a sustained or burst pattern depending on the gelator (approx. 10% dose in 24 h). The HET-CAM assay indicated that oleogel formulations did not induce ocular irritation and were safe for topical ocular administration. Corneal and scleral ex vivo assays evidenced the permeation of epalrestat from the oleorods up to 4 and 2.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> after six hours, respectively. Finally, the capacity of the developed oleogels to sustain release and provide significant amounts of epalrestat to the ocular tissues was demonstrated in vivo against aqueous-based niosomes and micelles formulations loaded with the same drug concentration.

Traditional Chinese medicine improved diabetic kidney disease through targeting gut microbiota.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) affects nearly 40% of diabetic patients, often leading to end-stage renal disease that requires renal replacement therapies, such as dialysis and transplantation. The gut microbiota, an integral aspect of human evolution, plays a crucial role in this condition. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown promising outcomes in ameliorating DKD by addressing the gut microbiota. This review elucidates the modifications in gut microbiota observed in DKD and explores the impact of TCM interventions on correcting microbial dysregulation. We searched relevant articles from databases including Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley, and Springer Nature. The following keywords were used: diabetic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, gut microbiota, natural product, TCM, Chinese herbal medicine, and Chinese medicinal herbs. Rigorous criteria were applied to identify high-quality studies on TCM interventions against DKD. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, including <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, and <i>Clostridium</i>, has been observed in individuals with DKD. Key indicators of microbial dysregulation include increased uremic solutes and decreased short-chain fatty acids. Various TCM therapies, such as formulas, tablets, granules, capsules, and decoctions, exhibit unique advantages in regulating the disordered microbiota to treat DKD. This review highlights the importance of targeting the gut-kidney axis to regulate microbial disorders, their metabolites, and associated signaling pathways in DKD. The Qing-Re-Xiao-Zheng formula, the Shenyan Kangfu tablet, the Huangkui capsule, and the Bekhogainsam decoction are potential candidates to address the gut-kidney axis. TCM interventions offer a significant therapeutic approach by targeting microbial dysregulation in patients with DKD.",['Wu XQ; Zhao L; Zhao YL; He XY; Zou L; Zhao YY; Li X'],2024,traditional Chinese medicine has shown promising outcomes in ameliorating DKD by addressing the gut microbiota. the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in this condition.
Molecular subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer across racial groups and gene expression platforms.,"High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) gene expression subtypes are associated with differential survival. We characterized HGSC gene expression in Black individuals and considered whether gene expression differences by self-identified race may contribute to poorer HGSC survival among Black versus White individuals. We included newly generated RNA-Seq data from Black and White individuals, and array-based genotyping data from four existing studies of White and Japanese individuals. We used K-means clustering, a method with no predefined number of clusters or dataset-specific features, to assign subtypes. Cluster- and dataset-specific gene expression patterns were summarized by moderated t-scores. We compared cluster-specific gene expression patterns across datasets by calculating the correlation between the summarized vectors of moderated t-scores. Following mapping to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-derived HGSC subtypes, we used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate subtype-specific survival by dataset. Cluster-specific gene expression was similar across gene expression platforms and racial groups. Comparing the Black population to the White and Japanese populations, the immunoreactive subtype was more common (39% versus 23%-28%) and the differentiated subtype less common (7% versus 22%-31%). Patterns of subtype-specific survival were similar between the Black and White populations with RNA-Seq data; compared to mesenchymal cases, the risk of death was similar for proliferative and differentiated cases and suggestively lower for immunoreactive cases (Black population HR=0.79 [0.55, 1.13], White population HR=0.86 [0.62, 1.19]). While the prevalence of HGSC subtypes varied by race, subtype-specific survival was similar. HGSC subtypes can be consistently assigned across platforms and self-identified racial groups.",['Davidson NR; Barnard ME; Hippen AA; Campbell A; Johnson CE; Way GP; Dalley BK; Berchuck A; Salas LA; Peres LC; Marks JR; Schildkraut JM; Greene CS; Doherty JA'],2024,HGSC gene expression subtypes are associated with differential survival. we compared cluster-specific gene expression patterns across datasets. cluster-specific gene expression patterns were summarized by moderated t-scores.
Pharmacodynamic changes in tumor and immune cells drive iberdomide's clinical mechanisms of activity in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.,"Iberdomide is a next-generation cereblon (CRBN)-modulating agent in the clinical development in multiple myeloma (MM). The analysis of biomarker samples from relapsed/refractory patients enrolled in CC-220-MM-001 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02773030), a phase 1/2 study, shows that iberdomide treatment induces significant target substrate degradation in tumors, including in immunomodulatory agent (IMiD)-refractory patients or those with low CRBN levels. Additionally, some patients with CRBN genetic dysregulation who responded to iberdomide have a similar median progression-free survival (PFS) (10.9 months) and duration of response (DOR) (9.5 months) to those without CRBN dysregulation (11.2 month PFS, 9.4 month DOR). Iberdomide treatment promotes a cyclical pattern of immune stimulation without causing exhaustion, inducing a functional shift in T cells toward an activated/effector memory phenotype, including in triple-class refractory patients and those receiving IMiDs as a last line of therapy. This analysis demonstrates that iberdomide's clinical mechanisms of action are driven by both its cell-autonomous effects overcoming CRBN dysregulation in MM cells, and potent immune stimulation that augments anti-tumor immunity.",['Amatangelo M; Flynt E; Stong N; Ray P; Van Oekelen O; Wang M; Ortiz M; Maciag P; Peluso T; Parekh S; van de Donk NWCJ; Lonial S; Thakurta A'],2024,iberdomide treatment induces significant target substrate degradation in tumors. iberdomide is a next-generation cereblon (CRBN)-modulating agent. iberdomide is a next-generation cereblon (CRBN)-modulating agent in the clinical development in multiple myeloma (MM)
Travel Distance and Spanish-Speaking are Associated with Delays in the Treatment of Cleft Palate.,"Delayed repair of cleft palate is associated with worse speech outcomes. Social determinants of health may influence the timing of surgery; however, there are no population health investigations to evaluate factors such as travel distance, language barriers, and payer. This study sought to identify factors that may interfere with timely cleft palate repair. Retrospective cohort. National/multi-center. All cleft palate repairs within California were extracted from 2000-2021. The primary outcome was age at surgical repair, which was modeled with linear regression. Covariates included race, primary language, distance from patient home to hospital, socioeconomic status, primary payer, and managed care enrollment status. 11 260 patients underwent surgical repair of a cleft palate. Black race was associated with delayed repair (22 additional days, <i>P</i> = .004, 95% CI 67.00-37.7) along with Asian/Pacific-Islander race (11 additional days, <i>P</i> = .006, 95% CI 3.26-18.9) compared to white race. Spanish-speaking patients had significantly later cleft palate repairs by 19 days, (<i>P</i> < .001, 95% CI 10.8-27.7) compared with English-speaking. Further distances from the hospital were significantly associated with later cleft surgeries with out-of-state patients undergoing surgery 52 days later (<i>P</i> < .001, 95% CI 11.3-24.3). Managed care plans and Medi-Cal were significantly associated with earlier surgical repair compared with private insurance. Black, Asian Pacific Islander, and Spanish-speaking patients and greater distance traveled to hospital were associated with delayed cleft palate repairs. These results underscore the importance of addressing structural and social barriers to care to improve outcomes and reduce health disparities for patients with cleft palate.",['Stanton EW; Rochlin D; Lorenz HP; Sheckter CC'],2024,"cleft palate repairs within California were extracted from 2000-2021. the primary outcome was age at surgical repair, which was modeled with linear regression. black race was associated with delayed repair, Asian/Pacific-Islander race compared to white race."
Protein N-glycans in Healthy and Sclerotic Glomeruli in Diabetic Kidney Disease.,"Diabetes is expected to directly impact renal glycosylation, yet to date, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of alterations in N-glycan composition in the glomeruli of patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). We used untargeted mass spectrometry imaging to identify N-glycan structures in healthy and sclerotic glomeruli in FFPE sections from needle biopsies of five patients with DKD and three healthy kidney samples. Regional proteomics was performed on glomeruli from additional biopsies from the same patients to compare the abundances of enzymes involved in glycosylation. Secondary analysis of single nuclei transcriptomics (snRNAseq) data was used to inform on transcript levels of glycosylation machinery in different cell types and states. We detected 120 N-glycans, and among them identified twelve of these protein post-translated modifications that were significantly increased in glomeruli. All glomeruli-specific N-glycans contained an N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) epitope. Five N-glycan structures were highly discriminant between sclerotic and healthy glomeruli. Sclerotic glomeruli had an additional set of glycans lacking fucose linked to their core, and they did not show tetra-antennary structures that are common in healthy glomeruli. Orthogonal omics analyses revealed lower protein abundance and lower gene expression involved in synthesizing fucosylated and branched N-glycans in sclerotic podocytes. In snRNAseq and regional proteomics analyses, we observed that genes and/or proteins involved in sialylation and LacNAc synthesis were also downregulated in DKD glomeruli, but this alteration remained undetectable by our spatial N-glycomics assay. Integrative spatial glycomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics revealed protein N-glycosylation characteristic of sclerotic glomeruli in DKD.","[""Veličković D; Shapiro JP; Parikh SV; Rovin B; Toto RD; Vazquez MA; Poggio ED; O'Toole JF; Sedor JR; Alexandrov T; Jain S; Bitzer M; Hodgin J; Veličković M; Sharma K; Anderton CR""]",2024,sclerotic glomeruli had an additional set of glycans lacking fucose. tetra-antennary structures were common in healthy glomeruli.
Comparison of Sleeve Gastrectomy with Loop Duodenojejunal Bypass Versus One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass for Type 2 Diabetes: The Role of Pylorus Preservation.,"One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is recognized as a standard procedure in metabolic surgery. However, concerns about postoperative bile reflux and nutritional risks are prevalent. Comparatively, sleeve gastrectomy with loop duodenojejunal bypass (SG + LoopDJB) bypasses an equivalent length of the foregut as OAGB while maintaining pyloric function. The role of pylorus function remains to be further elucidated regarding these metabolic procedures' therapeutic outcomes and side effects. A retrospective study was conducted in our center to compare the surgical safety and 1-year outcomes of OAGB and SG + LoopDJB regarding type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remission, weight loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and nutritional status in T2DM patients matched by gender, age, and BMI. The baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Compared with OAGB, SG + LoopDJB had longer operative time and length of stay (LOS) but similar major postoperative complications. At 1-year follow-up, OAGB has similar diabetes remission (both 91.9%), weight loss effect (28.1 ± 7.1% vs. 30.2 ± 7.0% for %TWL), and lipidemia improvement to SG + LoopDJB (P > 0.05). However, OAGB presented a higher incidence of hypoalbuminemia (11.9% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.026) but a low incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms (9.5% vs. 26.2%, P = 0.046) than SG + LoopDJB. There was no statistical difference regarding other gastrointestinal disorders and nutritional deficiencies between groups. Both OAGB and SG + LoopDJB show comparable, favorable outcomes in weight loss, T2DM remission, and lipidemia improvement at the 1-year follow-up. Pylorus preservation, while increasing surgical difficulty and the risk of de novo GERD, may reduce the risk of postoperative hypoalbuminemia.",['Si Y; Lin S; Guan W; Shen J; Liang H'],2024,"sleeve gastrectomy bypass bypass bypass bypass bypasses an equivalent length of the foregut as OAGB while maintaining pyloric function.

External stenting for saphenous vein grafts reduce early postoperative graft failure.,"Multiple studies showed that external stenting mitigates the progression of vein graft disease years after CABG. We used computed tomography to evaluate the effect of external stenting on perioperative vein graft patency. This study assessed graft patency rates of saphenous vein grafts (SVG) in consecutive isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients between 2018 and 2021. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare the outcomes of supported and non-supported groups at both patient and graft levels, with age, EurSCORE II, gender, diabetes, and arterial grafts as covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed based on different covariates. The study aimed to provide valuable insights into the clinical outcomes of SVG grafts in CABG patients. The study examined a total of 357 patients who met the inclusion criteria and evaluated 572 vein grafts. Out of these, 150 patients (205 SVGs) received ExSt, while 207 patients (337 SVGs) did not receive ExSt. The study results indicated that the likelihood of overall SVG patency at discharge was higher in the stented group compared to the non-stented group, both at the level of grafts (93.8% vs 87.8%, odds ratio [OR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-4.5; P = 0.05) and at the patient level (90.1% vs 83.5%, OR 1.8; 95% CI, 0.9-3.6; P = 0.1). It is worth noting that the difference between the stented and non-stented groups was most significant in the subgroup that received two arterial grafts (96.5% vs 89.6%, OR 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2-8.4; P = 0.02), and in the subgroup with higher EuroSCORE II (median >1.1) (98.6% vs 88.6%, OR 8.8; 95% CI, 1.1-72.7; P = 0.04). ExSt is associated with improved perioperative SVG patency at both graft and patient levels. Moreover, SVGs to the right territory and high-risk patients appear to have an advantage using ExSt.",['Dushaj S; Häussler A; Rings L; Ntinopoulos V; Papadopoulos N; Odavic D; Rodriguez Cetina Biefer H; Dzemali O'],2024,study assessed graft patency rates of saphenous vein grafts. logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare outcomes of supported and non-supported groups.
Gut microbiota induced abnormal amino acids and their correlation with diabetic retinopathy.,"To explore the correlation of gut microbiota and the metabolites with the progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and provide a novel strategy to elucidate the pathological mechanism of DR. The fecal samples from 32 type 2 diabetes patients with proliferative retinopathy (PDR), 23 with non-proliferative retinopathy (NPDR), 27 without retinopathy (DM), and 29 from the sex-, age- and BMI- matched healthy controls (29 HC) were analyzed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Sixty fecal samples from PDR, DM, and HC groups were assayed by untargeted metabolomics. Fecal metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Associations between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were analyzed. A cluster of 2 microbiome and 12 metabolites accompanied with the severity of DR, and the close correlation of the disease progression with PDR-related microbiome and metabolites were found. To be specific, the structure of gut microbiota differed in four groups. Diversity and richness of gut microbiota were significantly lower in PDR and NPDR groups, than those in DM and HC groups. A cluster of microbiome enriched in PDR group, including <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002</i>, <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-005</i>, <i>Christensenellaceae-R-7</i>, was observed. Functional analysis showed that the glucose and nicotinate degradations were significantly higher in PDR group than those in HC group. Arginine, serine, ornithine, and arachidonic acid were significantly enriched in PDR group, while proline was enriched in HC group. Functional analysis illustrated that arginine biosynthesis, lysine degradation, histidine catabolism, central carbon catabolism in cancer, D-arginine and D-ornithine catabolism were elevated in PDR group. Correlation analysis revealed that <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae-R-7</i> were positively associated with L-arginine, ornithine levels in fecal samples. This study elaborates the different microbiota structure in the gut from four groups. The relative abundance of <i>Ruminococcaceae-UCG-002</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i> are associated with the severity of DR. Amino acid and fatty acid catabolism is especially disordered in PDR group.

"DECREASED EXPRESSION OF MICRORNA-629 IN GASTRIC CANCER SAMPLES POTENTIATED BY THE VIRULENCE MARKER OF H. PYLORI, CAGA GENE.","Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium associated with the etiology of several gastrointestinal tract pathologies, and cagA-positive (cagA+) strains are found in populations with gastric ulcers and precancerous lesions, inducing pro-inflammatory responses. The development of neoplasms is related to microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation, indicating highly expressed miRNA-629. The article aims to correlate the expression level of miRNA-629 with the presence of H. pylori and the pathogenicity marker cagA. 203 gastric biopsy samples were evaluated from individuals with normal gastric tissue (n=60), gastritis (n=96), and gastric cancer (n=47) of both genders and over 18 years old. The samples were subdivided according to the presence or absence of H. pylori, detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RNA was extracted using a commercial kit and quantified. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using commercial kits, and the relative expression was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Individuals infected with H. pylori are nine times more likely to develop gastric cancer. Cancer patients appeared to have decreased expression of miRNA-629; however, the presence of the bacterium would not influence this reduction. Individuals in the cancer group showed lower miRNA-629 expression when cagA+; however, in the control group, the expression was higher when cagA+. H. pylori is a factor involved in the etiology and progression of gastric diseases. Reduction in miRNA-629 expression in cancer patients occurs independent of the presence of the bacterium, but when the cagA pathogenicity marker is present, it induces changes in the gene expression of the respective miRNA.",['Soares CDRR; Silva LMVD; Almeida BR; Pereira JN; Santos MPD; Barbosa MS; Smith MAC; Payão SLM; Rasmussen LT'],2024,a gram-negative bacterium is associated with several gastrointestinal tract pathologies. neoplasms are associated with microRNA dysregulation. the development of neoplasms is related to microRNA dysregulation.
The footprint of gut microbiota in gallbladder cancer: a mechanistic review.,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common malignant tumor of the biliary system with the worst prognosis. Even after radical surgery, the majority of patients with GBC have difficulty achieving a clinical cure. The risk of tumor recurrence remains more than 65%, and the overall 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. The gut microbiota refers to a variety of microorganisms living in the human intestine, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, which profoundly affect the host state of general health, disease and even cancer. Over the past few decades, substantial evidence has supported that gut microbiota plays a critical role in promoting the progression of GBC. In this review, we summarize the functions, molecular mechanisms and recent advances of the intestinal microbiota in GBC. We focus on the driving role of bacteria in pivotal pathways, such as virulence factors, metabolites derived from intestinal bacteria, chronic inflammatory responses and ecological niche remodeling. Additionally, we emphasize the high level of correlation between viruses and fungi, especially EBV and <i>Candida</i> spp., with GBC. In general, this review not only provides a solid theoretical basis for the close relationship between gut microbiota and GBC but also highlights more potential research directions for further research in the future.",['Liu S; Li W; Chen J; Li M; Geng Y; Liu Y; Wu W'],2024,the risk of tumor recurrence remains more than 65%. the overall 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. the gut microbiota refers to a variety of microorganisms living in the human intestine.
Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma: a rare case of rectal cancer.,"Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a histological variant that resembles nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma and occurs in various locations such as the salivary glands and lung. LELCs in the digestive tract are rare, accounting for only 2% of cases, being exceptional in the rectum. We present the case of an 84-year-old man with rectorrhagia, whitish malodorous discharge and constipation of one month's duration. Rectal examination identified a tumour. Colonoscopy revealed a rectal lesion that was confirmed by biopsy as malignant, and MRI showed an extensive rectal tumour. Histopathology revealed undifferentiated carcinoma with acute inflammatory infiltrate, consistent with LELC. Immunohistochemistry was positive for keratins 5/6, 18, 20, CEA and BER.EP4, while in situ hybridisation for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) RNA was negative. The multidisciplinary decision included neoadjuvant radiotherapy and anterior rectal resection. The patient remains in complete response two years after treatment. Histologically, LELC is characterised by an acute inflammatory infiltrate interspersed with poorly differentiated neoplastic cells. The stomach is the most commonly affected region in the gastrointestinal tract, with more than 80% of gastric LELCs associated with EBV. To date, only four cases of rectal LELC have been reported, and its association with EBV was demonstrated in only one case. There are no standard treatments for rectal LELC, underscoring the need to gather more cases to understand its pathogenesis and develop effective treatment strategies.",['Luengo Gómez D; Salmerón Ruíz Á; Pastor Mena J; Láinez Ramos-Bossini AJ'],2024,"a 84-year-old man with rectorrhagia, whitish malodorous discharge and constipation of one month's duration was treated. a tumour was confirmed by biopsy as malignant. a tumour was revealed by MRI."
A qualitative study of the experiences of insulin use by older people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"There is a rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes among older people. This population also suffers from co-morbidity and a greater number of diabetes related complications, such as visual and cognitive impairment, which can potentially affect their ability to manage insulin regimens. Understanding the experiences of older people when they transition to insulin will help the development of healthcare interventions to enhance their diabetes outcomes, overall health and quality of life. The aims of this exploratory study were to (1) understand the experiences of older people with type 2 diabetes in relation to insulin treatment initiation and management and (2) use this understanding to consider how the insulin management support provided to older people by healthcare providers could be more tailored to their needs. A qualitative study using semi structured (remote) interviews with older people with diabetes (n = 10) and caregivers (n = 4) from the UK. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, and framework analysis was used to analyse the data. Three main themes, along with six subthemes, were generated from the study data. Participants generally felt at ease with insulin administration following training, yet some reported feelings of failure at transitioning to insulin use. Participants were also frustrated at what they perceived were insufficient resources for effective self-management, coupled with a lack of professional interest in optimising their health as older people. Some also expressed dissatisfaction regarding the brevity of their consultations, inconsistent information from different healthcare professionals and poor treatment coordination between primary and secondary care. Overall, the study emphasised that older people need better support, education and resources to help manage their insulin use. Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to adopt a more individualised approach to supporting older people that acknowledges their prior knowledge, physical and psychological capabilities and motivation for diabetes self-management. In addition, better communication between different services and greater access to specialist support is clearly needed for this older population. An integrated care pathway for insulin use in older people could be considered. This would include an assessment of the older person's needs and capacity on their initiation to insulin; targeted education and training in self-management; timely access to appropriate emotional and peer support resources; care plans developed collaboratively with patients; and individualised glucose targets that recognise the needs and preferences of the older person.",['Langerman C; Forbes A; Robert G'],2024,study aims to understand the experiences of older people with type 2 diabetes. participants felt at ease with insulin administration following training. some reported feelings of failure at transitioning to insulin use.
The effects of policosanol supplementation on blood glucose: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Previous studies have assessed how supplementing with policosanol affects blood sugar levels. The outcomes, nevertheless, were not constant. Multiple electronic databases were searched including ISI Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus until February 9, 2023. To assess the effects of policosanol on glucose, we employed a random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis approach to examine the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CI) before and after policosanol and placebo administration. The final analysis comprised a total of 25 trials with 2680 participants. Compared to the control group, policosanol supplementation significantly reduced blood glucose levels (WMD: -2.24 mg/dl; 95 % CI: -4.05, -0.42, P = 0.01). Findings from subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction of policosanol supplementation on glucose levels in period of less than 24 weeks, and in individuals below 50 years of age. Additionally, the reduction was statistically significant in dosage of 10 mg/day. Our dose-response analysis indicates no evidence of a non-linear relationship between policosanol dose and duration and changes in glucose levels (P-nonlinearity = 0.52, and P-nonlinearity = 0.52, respectively). Policosanol supplementation might improve blood glucose.

Multimodal data integration for enhanced longitudinal prediction for cardiac and cerebrovascular events following initial diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.,"Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), a prevalent condition, often coexists with intricate metabolic issues and is frequently associated with negative cardiovascular outcomes. We developed a longitudinal prediction model integrating multimodal data for cardiovascular risk stratification of patients with an initial diagnosis of OSAS. We reviewed the data of patients with new-onset OSAS who underwent diagnostic polysomnography between 2018-19. Patients were treated using standard treatment regimens according to clinical practice guidelines. Over a median follow-up of 32 months, 98/729 participants (13.4%) experienced our composite outcome. At a ratio of 7:3, cases were randomly divided into development (n = 510) and validation (n = 219) cohorts. A prediction nomogram was created using six clinical factors - sex, age, diabetes mellitus, history of coronary artery disease, triglyceride-glucose index, and apnea-hypopnea index. The prediction nomogram showed excellent discriminatory power, based on Harrell's C-index values of 0.826 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.779-0.873) for the development cohort and 0.877 (95% CI = 0.824-0.93) for the validation cohort. Moreover, comparing the predicted and observed major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in both development and validation cohorts indicated that the prediction nomogram was well-calibrated. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the good clinical applicability of the prediction nomogram.

Clinical factors associated with smoking cessation among smokers with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease by sex: Longitudinal analyses from French smoking cessation services.,"Smoking is responsible for 80 % of cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), while the prognosis is improved by smoking cessation (SC). We examined clinical factors associated with SC among smokers with COPD comparing women and men. The study comprised a cohort of 1470 smokers who visited a SC service and completed at least 28-day of follow-up visits. The outcome was smoking status at follow-up (abstinence, reduction, no change). Abstinence was defined as continuous abstinence for at least 28 days, validated by the measurement of expired Carbon Monoxide. Reduction was defined as a halving of the baseline tobacco consumption. The average age of the population was 53 (±11) years and 58.2 % were women. Men were 2 years younger than women and consulted more likely after a hospital contact, whereas women consulted on their own initiative. Women more often had a depression history, whereas men had medical comorbidities and co-addictions. There was no significant difference by sex regarding the abstinence rate (41.0 % in women vs 40.7 in men, p > 0.9). The factors significantly associated with higher abstinence rates in both sexes were: at least one previous quit attempt and number of follow-up visits ≥4. The factors negatively associated with quitting in women were diabetes, intake of mood stabilizers and consuming more than 10 cigarettes per day while having a chronic bronchitis, taking antidepressants and having consumed cannabis in the last 30 days hampered SC in men. Concerning factors associated with SC, few differences were found between female and male smokers suffering from COPD. However, due to the different medical and smoking behavior characteristics according to sex, it might be important to take these differences into account in order to provide tailored SC management.",['Allagbé I; Nicolas R; Airagnes G; Frédéric L; Boussadi AA; Le Faou AL'],2024,smokers with COPD have 80 % of cases of chronic obstructive Pulmonary Disease. the prognosis is improved by smoking cessation (SC). the study included a cohort of 1470 smokers who completed at least 28-day of follow-up visits.
E-cadherin expression and gene expression profiles in corticotroph pituitary neuroendocrine tumor subtypes.,"Corticotroph adenomas/pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Predictors of tumor behavior have not shown high prognostic accuracy. For somatotroph adenomas/PitNETs, E-cadherin expression correlates strongly with prognosis. E-cadherin expression has not been investigated in other PitNETs. A retrospective chart review of adults with corticotroph adenomas/PitNETs was conducted to assess correlation between E-cadherin expression and tumor characteristics. In addition, gene expression microarray was performed in subset of tumors (n = 16). Seventy-seven patients were identified; 71% were female, with median age of cohort 45.2 years. Seventy-five percent had macroadenomas, of which 22% were hormonally active. Ninety-five percent of microadenomas were hormonally active. Adrenocorticotropic hormone granulation pattern by IHC identified 63% as densely granulated (DG) and 34% as sparsely granulated (SG). All microadenomas were DG (p < .001); 50% of macroadenomas were DG associated with increased tumor invasion compared to SG. E-cadherin IHC was positive in 80%, diminished in 17%, and absent in 20% and did not correlate with corticotroph PitNETs subtype, size, or prognosis. In contrast to the distinct transcriptomes of corticotroph PitNETs and normal pituitaries, a comparison of clinically active and silent corticotroph PitNETs demonstrated similar molecular signatures indicating their common origin, but with unique differences related to their secretory status.",['Kiseljak-Vassiliades K; Lipe K; Turin CG; Fishbein L; Costello JC; Kerr JM; Holmstoen TB; Youssef AS; Lillehei KO; Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK; Wierman ME'],2024,corticotroph adenomas/pituitary neuroendocrine tumors are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. somatotroph adenomas/PitNETs are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
Pericyte in retinal vascular diseases: A multifunctional regulator and potential therapeutic target.,"Retinal vascular diseases (RVDs), in particular diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and retinopathy of prematurity, are leading contributors to blindness. The pathogenesis of RVD involves vessel dilatation, leakage, and occlusion; however, the specific underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent findings have indicated that pericytes (PCs), as critical members of the vascular mural cells, significantly contribute to the progression of RVDs, including detachment from microvessels, alteration of contractile and secretory properties, and excessive production of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, PCs are believed to have mesenchymal stem properties and, therefore, might contribute to regenerative therapy.

Known for limited targeted therapies, it poses challenges and requires personalized treatment strategies. Differential analysis revealed a significant decrease in keratin 81 (KRT81) expression in non-TNBC samples and an increase in TNBC samples, lower KRT81 expression correlated with better TNBC patient outcomes. It emerged as an independent predictive factor for TNBC, with associations found between its expression and clinically relevant features. We further developed a nomogram for survival probability assessment based on Cox regression results, demonstrating its accuracy through calibration curves. Gene annotation analysis indicated that KRT81 is involved in immune-related pathways and tumor cell adhesion. KRT81 is associated with immune cell infiltration of Follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and CD8 + T cells, suggesting its potential impact on the immunological microenvironment. The study delved into KRT81's predictive value for immunotherapy responses, high expression of KRT81 was associated with greater potential for immune evasion. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis pinpointed KRT81 expression within a specific malignant subtype which was a risk factor for TNBC. Furthermore, KRT81 promoted TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion was confirmed by gene knockout or overexpression assay. Co-culture experiments further indicated KRT81's potential role in inhibiting CD8 + T cells, and correlation analysis implied KRT81 was highly correlated with immune checkpoint CD276, providing insights into its involvement in the immune microenvironment via CD276. In conclusion, this comprehensive study positions KRT81 as a promising prognostic marker for predicting tumor progression and immunotherapy responses in TNBC.",['Yan Z; Zhong Z; Shi C; Feng M; Feng X; Liu T'],2024,keratin 81 (KRT81) expression in non-TNBC samples. lower expression of KRT81 correlated with better patient outcomes.
Implication of serum and salivary albumin tests in the recent oral health related epidemiological studies: A narrative review.,"Albumin is the most abundant protein in human serum and a specific amount of albumin also can be found in the saliva. It has several physiological functions such as blood colloidal osmotic pressure, antioxidant activity, binding and transporting of endogenous and exogenous substrates. We conducted an electronic search across several databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Embase and Science Direct using the relevant MeSH terms and keywords like ""albumin"", ""serum albumin"", ""salivary albumin"", ""oral health"" ""dental caries"" and ""epidemiology"". Only the epidemiological studies published between 2010 and 2023 were included. After the application of the inclusion criteria, a total of 51 studied were included in this narrative review. Serum and salivary albumin tests have been used in various aspects of oral health as a diagnostic and prognostic factor. Some of the results point out to a pattern of association while some of them are inconclusive and even contradictory. This narrative review discusses the role, significance and impact of albumin in epidemiological oral health related studies including the categories of periodontal health and disease, dental caries, oral function and hypofunction, nutrition and malnutrition, tooth loss and its treatment, diabetes and cancer.

Combining anti-VEGFR and anti-EGFR antibodies: Randomized phase II study of irinotecan and cetuximab with/without ramucirumab in second-line colorectal cancer:(ECOG-ACRIN E7208).,"Early studies showed promise of combined anti-EGFR plus anti-VEGF antibodies for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC), yet this was later rejected as toxic and ineffective in studies not selected for RAS status. We studied advanced KRAS wild-type CRC, as second-line treatment, using irinotecan-cetuximab (IC) with or without the anti-VEGFR antibody, ramucirumab (ICR). Patients with one prior regimen including fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab, with KRAS wild-type tumors, were stratified by ECOG PS, time since last chemotherapy and progression on oxaliplatin, to IC (180 and 500 mg/2 q2w), vs modified ICR (mICR) (150 and 400 mg/m2 plus 6 mg/kg respectively). 102 patients were compared for progression-free survival (PFS) as primary endpoint (85% power for 70% improvement in median PFS from 4.5 to 7.65 months). Of the 102 enrolled, 44 treated with IC and 45 with mICR were evaluable. Median PFS was 6.0 vs 9.2 months respectively (HR 0.75, p = .07, significant by study design for p < .128). Response rate was 23% vs 36% (p = .27) and disease-control rate (DCR) was 52% vs 73% (p = .05). Grade ≥3 toxicity was not equivalent. Overall survival was not significantly different at ∼19 months. Previous phase 3 trials without RAS genotyping, rejected combining anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF drugs. In this randomized multi-center phase 2 study for KRAS wild type CRC (all previously bevacizumab-treated) the addition of ramucirumab, to irinotecan and cetuximab improved PFS and DCR, showing the combination is feasible and effective here. Further phase 3 trials with appropriate patient-selection are required.

Higher plant-derived nitrate intake is associated with lower odds of frailty in a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older women.,"Dietary nitrate intake is inversely related to numerous contributors towards frailty, including cardiovascular disease and poor physical function. Whether these findings extend to frailty remain unknown. We investigated if habitual nitrate intake, derived from plants or animal-based foods, was cross-sectionally associated with frailty in women. Community-dwelling older Australian women (n = 1390, mean age 75.1 ± 2.7 years) completed a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Nitrate concentrations in food were obtained from international nitrate databases. We adopted the Rockwood frailty index (FI) of cumulative deficits comprising 33 variables across multiple health domains (scored 0 to 1), which predicts increased hospitalisation and mortality risk. A FI ≥ 0.25 indicated frailty. Cross-sectional associations between nitrate intake (total plant and animal nitrate, separately) and frailty were analysed using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models (including lifestyle factors), as part of restricted cubic splines. A non-linear inverse relationship was observed between total plant nitrate intake and frailty. Compared to women with the lowest plant nitrate intake (Quartile [Q]1), women with greater intakes in Q2 (OR 0.69 95%CI 0.56-0.84), Q3 (OR 0.67 95%CI 0.50-0.90) and Q4 (OR 0.66 95%CI 0.45-0.98) had lower odds for frailty. A nadir in the inverse association was observed once intakes reached ~ 64 mg/d (median Q2). No relationship was observed between total animal nitrate and frailty. Community-dwelling older women consuming low amounts of plant-derived nitrate were more likely to present with frailty. Consuming at least one daily serving (~ 75 g) of nitrate-rich green leafy vegetables may be beneficial in preventing frailty.",['Hayes E; Dent E; Shannon OM; Zhong LZ; Bozanich T; Blekkenhorst LC; Zhu K; Bondonno CP; Siervo M; Hoogendijk EO; Hodgson JM; Prince RL; Lewis JR; Sim M'],2024,nitrate intake is inversely related to numerous contributors towards frailty. nitrate intake is derived from plants or animal-based foods. nitrate concentrations in food were obtained from international nitrate databases.
The association between triglyceride-glucose index and related parameters and risk of cardiovascular disease in American adults under different glucose metabolic states.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses an array of cardiac and vascular disorders, posing a significant threat to global health. It remains unclear whether there exists an association between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and its derived indices and the incidence of cardiovascular disease, and in particular, the strength of the association in populations with different glucose metabolisms is not known. Data extracted from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the period from 1999 to 2020, involving a cohort of 14,545 participants, were leveraged for the analysis. Statistical assessments were executed utilizing R software, employing multivariable logistic regression models to scrutinize the correlation between TyG and its associated parameters with the incidence of cardiovascular disease across diverse glucose metabolism categories. Interaction analyses and restricted cubic splines were applied to evaluate potential heterogeneity in associations and investigate the link between TyG and its derivatives with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the extent of variability in the predictive performance of TyG and its derived parameters for cardiovascular disease across distinct glucose metabolic statuses. This study found that TyG and its related parameters were differentially associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in different glucose metabolic states. Curvilinear correlations were found between TyG in the IFG population and TyG-WC, TyG-BMI, and TyG-WHtR in the impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) population with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease. In addition, the introduction of TyG and its derived parameters into the classical Framingham cardiovascular risk model improved the predictive performance in different glucose metabolism populations. Among them, the introduction of TyG-WHtR in the normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), IFG & IGT and diabetes groups and TyG in the IGT group maximized the predictive power. The findings provide new insights into the relationship between the TyG index and its derived parameters in different glucose metabolic states and the risk of cardiovascular disease, offering important reference value for future clinical practice and research. The study highlights the potential for improved risk stratification and prevention strategies based on TyG and its derived parameters.",['Zhuang Y; Qiu L; Han D; Qiao Z; Wang F; Jiang Q; An Q; Li Y; Shangguan J; Bi X; Shen D'],2024,it remains unclear whether there exists an association between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and its derived indices and the incidence of cardiovascular disease. the strength of the association in populations with different glucose metabolisms is not known.
An analysis of health-related quality of life in children and adolescents after parotidectomy based on patient-reported outcomes.,"To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its influencing factors in these pediatric patients undergoing parotidectomy. This was a cross-sectional study that included 37 children and adolescents (≤ 19 years) with parotid gland tumors who were treated in Sichuan Cancer Hospital between January 2006 and November 2021. HRQoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyze the factors influencing patients' HRQoL. 37 children and adolescents were included in the study, including 22 cases of benign tumors and 15 cases of malignant tumors. All patients underwent surgery, and some patients with malignant tumors received radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Malignancy, permanent facial palsy, and Frey syndrome were associated with worse HRQoL in children and adolescents with parotid gland tumors. Radiotherapy and no cervical lymph node dissection were associated with worse HRQoL in pediatric patients with malignancy. The surgical approach of parotid is not a factor influencing HRQoL.

Comparison of Computed Tomography Findings in Lung Tuberculosis in Diabetic and Nondiabetic Patients.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of mortality globally. The purpose of this research is to examine the clinical and radiological characteristics of patients with TB and diabetes. The research comprised 276 TB patients, 52 of whom were diabetic and 224 of whom were not. During the evaluation of the patients' clinical histories, age, gender, diagnostic indicator, and whether or not they had undergone prior treatment were questioned, as were the requirement of inpatient treatment and the existence of drug resistance. Radiographically, they were questioned in terms of bilateral-unilateral extent, percentage of parenchymal involvement, cavitation, tree-in-bud appearance, the presence of ground glass, consolidation, miliary involvement, sequela fibrotic changes, parenchymal calcification, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, and pleural calcification. In addition, segmenting was used to assess involvement in the affected lobes. When we look at the results of 276 patients, 182 males and 94 females, the mean age is 46.01 ± 17.83. Diabetes and TB coexistence are more prevalent in male individuals (P = 0.029). Smear positivity and the need for inpatient treatment were found to be higher in the clinical features of diabetic patients (P = 0.05 and P = 0.01, respectively).

Journeying together: spousal experiences with prostate cancer in Ghana.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant global health concern for men. In Sub-Saharan Africa, PCa rates witnessed a 69% increase from 1990 to 2010. Despite this, there is a dearth of literature examining the experiences of spouses of men with PCa in Africa, as the majority of studies concentrate primarily on men. The study used a qualitative exploratory design, conducting in-depth face-to-face interviews with a semi-structured guide. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, with 35 recruited. Data was recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using content analysis, resulting in 2 themes and 11 subthemes. The research revealed that spouses providing care for husbands with PCa faced notable effects on their physical and emotional well-being. Notably, they reported experiencing leg pains due to prolonged sitting by their partners, as well as disruptions in sleep and a loss of appetite triggered by the hospital smell. Women encounter challenges in caring for their partners with PCa. Understanding these experiences will contribute to improving public support and assistance.

Increasing dietary fiber intake for type 2 diabetes mellitus management: A systematic review.,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, non-communicable disease with a substantial global impact, affecting a significant number of individuals. Its etiology is closely tied to imbalanced dietary practices and sedentary lifestyles. Conversely, increasing die-tary fiber (DF) intake has consistently demonstrated health benefits in numerous studies, including improvements in glycemic control and weight management. To investigate the efficacy of DF interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A systematic literature review was conducted to explore the association between DF intake and the management of T2DM. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 26 studies were included in this review. The main strategies implied to increased DF intake were: High DF diet plus acarbose (2 studies); DF supplements (14 studies); and high DF diets (10 studies). Overall, most studies indicated that increased DF intake resulted in im-provements in glycemic control and weight management in T2DM patients. DF represents a valuable strategy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving health outcomes. DF intake offers the potential to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality associated with diabetes. Likewise, through supplements or enriched foods, DF contributes significantly to the control of several markers such as HbA1c, blood glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and body weight.",['Nitzke D; Czermainski J; Rosa C; Coghetto C; Fernandes SA; Carteri RB'],2024,DF intake has consistently demonstrated health benefits in numerous studies. a systematic literature review was conducted to investigate the association between DF intake and the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Combination SGLT2 Inhibitor and Glucagon Receptor Antagonist Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"To examine the effects of insulin-adjunctive therapy with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor and a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) on glycemia, insulin use, and ketogenesis during insulinopenia in type 1 diabetes. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial we assessed the effects of adjunctive SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (dapagliflozin 10 mg daily) alone and in combination with the GRA volagidemab (70 mg weekly) in 12 adults with type 1 diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring, insulin dosing, and insulin withdrawal tests (IWT) for measurement of glucose and ketogenesis during insulinopenia were completed during insulin-only (Baseline), SGLT2 inhibitor, and combination (SGLT2 inhibitor + GRA) therapy periods. Average glucose and percent time with glucose in range (70-180 mg/dL) improved with combination therapy versus Baseline and SGLT2 inhibitor (131 vs. 150 and 138 mg/dL [P < 0.001 and P = 0.01] and 86% vs. 70% and 78% [P < 0.001 and P = 0.03], respectively) without increased hypoglycemia. Total daily insulin use decreased with combination therapy versus Baseline and SGLT2 inhibitor (0.41 vs. 0.56 and 0.52 units/kg/day [P < 0.001 and P = 0.002]). Peak β-hydroxybutyrate levels during IWT were lower with combination therapy than with SGLT2 inhibitor (2.0 vs. 2.4 mmol/L; P = 0.048) and similar to levels reached during the Baseline testing period (2.1 mmol/L). Participants reported enhanced treatment acceptability and satisfaction with combination therapy. Glucagon antagonism enhances the therapeutic effects of SGLT2 inhibition in type 1 diabetes.

Low subcutaneous adipose tissue and myosteatosis are prognostic factors after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) represents the only curative treatment option for several hematological neoplasms. This study aimed to assess the parameters of body composition as predictors of post-transplant overall survival (OS) and adverse events in patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). This was a retrospective study of 122 adult patients who underwent their first allo-HSCT. The CT-based semi-automated measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VSR), sarcopenia in terms of skeletal muscle index (SMI), and myosteatosis based on the skeletal muscle radiation attenuation (SM-RA) was performed. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association of body composition parameters with OS. In the univariate analysis, low SAT and myosteatosis were associated with lower OS (hazard ratio [HR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-3.51, p = 0.01) and (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.48-4.25, p =< 0.001), respectively. This association remained significant after adjusting for relevant covariates, with HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.23-4.38, p = 0.01 and HR 2.86, 95% CI 1.51-5.43, p =< 0.001, respectively. On the contrary, VAT, VSR, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity were not statistically significant in OS. Severe post-transplant adverse events were more common in the low SAT group (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% CI 1.32-7.40, p = 0.01) and OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.31-7.70, p =< 0.01 in the age- and sex-adjusted analysis.

Development of an analytical platform for the affinity screening of natural extracts by SEC-MS towards PPARα and PPARγ receptors.,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors and represent the targets for the therapeutical treatment of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia associated with metabolic syndrome. Some medicinal plants have been traditionally used to treat this kind of metabolic diseases. Today only few drugs targeting PPARs have been approved and for this reason, the rapid identification of novel ligands and/or chemical scaffolds starting from natural extracts would benefit of a selective affinity ligand fishing assay. In this paper we describe the development of a new ligand fishing assay based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled to LC-MS for the analysis of complex samples such as botanical extracts. The known PPARα and PPARγ ligands, WY-14643 and rosiglitazone respectively, were used for system development and evaluation.

AMPK activation eliminates senescent cells in diabetic wound by inducing NCOA4 mediated ferritinophagy.,"Diabetic wounds are one of the long-term complications of diabetes, with a disordered microenvironment, diabetic wounds can easily develop into chronic non-healing wounds, which can impose a significant burden on healthcare. In diabetic condition, senescent cells accumulate in the wound area and suppress the wound healing process. AMPK, as a molecule related to metabolism, has a close relationship with aging and diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AMPK activation on wound healing and explore the underlying mechanisms. AMPK activator A769662 was topically applied in wound models of diabetic mice. Alterations in the wound site were observed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The markers related to autophagy and ferritinophagy were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The role of AMPK activation and ferritinophagy were also analyzed by western blotting. Our results show that AMPK activation improved diabetic wound healing and reduced the accumulation of senescent cells. Intriguingly, we found that AMPK activation-induced ferroptosis is autophagy-dependent. We detected that the level of ferritin had deceased and NCOA4 was markedly increased after AMPK activation treatment. We further investigated that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy was involved in ferroptosis triggered by AMPK activation. Most importantly, AMPK activation can reverse the ferroptosis-insensitive of senescent fibroblast cells in diabetic mice wound area and promote wound healing. These results suggest that activating AMPK can promote diabetic wound healing by reversing the ferroptosis-insensitive of senescent fibroblast cells. AMPK may serve as a regulatory factor in senescent cells in the diabetic wound area, therefore AMPK activation can become a promising therapeutic method for diabetic non-healing wounds.",['Liu M; Wei X; Zheng Z; Xie E; Yu Q; Gao Y; Ma J; Yang L'],2024,senescent cells accumulate in the wound area and suppress wound healing process.

Transcriptome analysis of immune-inflammatory regulation in Tremella fuciformis-derived polysaccharide reeducated B16 cells: A subcutaneous model.,"Circulating cancer cells have characteristics of tumor self-targeting. Modified circulating tumor cells may serve as tumor-targeted cellular drugs. Tremella fuciformis-derived polysaccharide (TFP) is related to immune regulation and tumor inhibition, so could B16 cells reeducated by TFP be an effective anti-tumor drug? To evaluate the intrinsic therapeutic potential of B16 cells exposed to TFP and clarify the therapeutic molecules or pathways altered by this process. RNA-seq technology was used to study the effect of TFP-reeducated B16 cells on the immune and inflammatory system by placing the allograft subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice. Tremella fuciformis-derived polysaccharide-reeducated B16 cells recruited leukocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs), and mast cells into the subcutaneous region and promoted the infiltration of several cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interleukin 1 (IL-1). Tumor necrosis factor alpha also activated Th17 lymphocytes to secrete interleukin 17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ). The co-expression of IFN-γ and IL-17 was favorable for tumor immunity to shrink tumors. In short, TFP-reeducated B16 cells activated the innate and adaptive immune responses, especially Th17 cell differentiation and IFN-γ production, as well as the TNF-α signaling pathway, which re-regulated the inflammatory and immune systems. B16 cells subcutaneously exposed to TFP in mice induced an immune and inflammatory response to inhibit tumors. The study of the function of TFP-reeducated B16 cells to improve cancer immunotherapy may be of particular research interest. This approach could be an alternative and more efficient strategy to deliver cytokines and open up new possibilities for long-lasting, multi-level tumor control.",['Li X; Su Q; Pan Y'],2024,circulating tumor cells have characteristics of tumor self-targeting. circulating tumor cells may serve as tumor-targeted cellular drugs.

Based on consumption of foods that were categorized as either having medium or high microbial content (MedHi foods), participants were classified into three groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the association of consumption of MedHi foods with mortality. Population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of consumption of MedHi foods in relation to mortality risk were also estimated. A total of 35,299 adults aged ≥ 20 years were included in this study. During a median follow-up of 9.67 years, compared with adults in G1, those in G3 had 16% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.90) reduced risk of all-cause mortality, and 23% (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67-0.89) reduced risk of CVD-specific mortality. The PAF of high (G3) vs. intermediate or low consumption of MedHi foods (G1 + G2) with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality was 3.4% and 4.3%, respectively. Consumption of foods with higher microbial concentrations is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality in US adults.",['Liang Z; Sun X; Shi J; Tian Y; Wang Y; Cheng Y; Liu Y'],2024,"study was conducted by the national health and nutrition examination survey. participants were classified into three groups. a total of 35,299 adults aged  20 years were included in this study."
Failed recovery after pancreatoduodenectomy: A significant problem even without surgical complications.,"The absence of surgical complications has traditionally been used to define successful recovery after pancreas surgery. However, patient-reported outcome measures as metrics of a challenging recovery may be superior to objective morbidity. This study aims to evaluate the use of patient-reported outcomes in assessing recovery after pancreas surgery. Patients scheduled for pancreatoduodenectomy were prospectively enrolled between 2016 to 2018. Patient-reported outcomes were collected using the linear analog self-assessment questionnaire preoperatively and on postoperative days 2, 7, 14, 30, and monthly until 6 months. Patients were also asked if they felt fully recovered at 30 days and 6 months. Thirty-day surgical morbidity was prospectively assessed, and the comprehensive complication index at 30 days was used to categorize morbidity as major or multiple minor complications (comprehensive complication index ≥26.2) vs uncomplicated (comprehensive complication index <26.2). Clinically significant International Study Group Pancreas Surgery Grade B and C pancreatic fistulas and delayed gastric emptying were reported. χ<sup>2</sup> and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess associations with recovery by 6 months and quality of life throughout the postoperative period. Of 116 patients who met inclusion criteria and were enrolled, 32 (28%) had major or multiple minor complications (comprehensive complication index ≥26.2). Overall, fewer than 1 in 10 patients (7%) reported feeling fully recovered at 30 days postoperatively, whereas 55% reported feeling fully recovered at 6 months. Of patients suffering major morbidity, 62% did not recover by 6 months, whereas 38% of those in the uncomplicated group reported not being recovered at 6 months (P = .03). Patients who experienced delayed gastric emptying reported low quality-of-life scores at 1 month (P = .04) compared to those with no delayed gastric emptying, but this did not persist at 6 months (P = .80). Postoperative pancreatic fistula was not associated with quality of life at 1 or 6 months (both P > .05). In the uncomplicated patients, age, sex, surgical approach, and cancer status were not associated with failed recovery at 6 months (all P > .05), and healthier patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists 1-2) were less likely to report complete recovery (42% vs 69% American Society of Anesthesiologists 3-4, P = .04). With the exception of higher preoperative pain scores (mean 2.3 [standard deviation 2.4] among patients not fully recovered at 6 months vs 1.6 [2.2] among those fully recovered, P = .04), preoperative patient-reported outcomes were not associated with failed recovery at 6 months (all P > .05). However, lower 30-day quality of life, social activity, pain, and fatigue scores were associated with incomplete recovery at 6 months. More than 1 in 3 patients with an uncomplicated course do not feel fully recovered from pancreas surgery at 6 months; the presence of surgical complications did not universally correspond with recovery failure. In patients with complications, delayed gastric emptying appears to drive quality of life more significantly than postoperative pancreatic fistula. In patients with uncomplicated recovery, healthier patients were less likely to report full recovery at 6 months. Thirty-day patient-reported outcomes may be able to identify patients who are at risk of incomplete long-term recovery.",['Fiorentini G; Bingener J; Hanson KT; Starlinger P; Smoot RL; Warner SG; Truty MJ; Kendrick ML; Thiels CA'],2024,patients scheduled for pancreatoduodenectomy were prospectively enrolled. patients were asked if they felt fully recovered at 30 days and 6 months. fewer than 1 in 10 patients reported feeling fully recovered at 30 days postoperatively.
Interaction between the gut microbiota and colonic enteroendocrine cells regulates host metabolism.,"Nutrient handling is an essential function of the gastrointestinal tract. Hormonal responses of small intestinal enteroendocrine cells (EECs) have been extensively studied but much less is known about the role of colonic EECs in metabolic regulation. To address this core question, we investigated a mouse model deficient in colonic EECs. Here we show that colonic EEC deficiency leads to hyperphagia and obesity. Furthermore, colonic EEC deficiency results in altered microbiota composition and metabolism, which we found through antibiotic treatment, germ-free rederivation and transfer to germ-free recipients, to be both necessary and sufficient for the development of obesity. Moreover, studying stool and blood metabolomes, we show that differential glutamate production by intestinal microbiota corresponds to increased appetite and that colonic glutamate administration can directly increase food intake. These observations shed light on an unanticipated host-microbiota axis in the colon, part of a larger gut-brain axis, that regulates host metabolism and body weight.",['Tan S; Santolaya JL; Wright TF; Liu Q; Fujikawa T; Chi S; Bergstrom CP; Lopez A; Chen Q; Vale G; McDonald JG; Schmidt A; Vo N; Kim J; Baniasadi H; Li L; Zhu G; He TC; Zhan X; Obata Y; Jin A; Jia D; Elmquist JK; Sifuentes-Dominguez L; Burstein E'],2024,mouse model deficient in colonic EECs shows that colonic EEC deficiency leads to hyperphagia and obesity. colonic EEC deficiency results in altered microbiota composition and metabolism.
"Dietary intake, obesity, and metabolic risk factors among children and adolescents in the SEACO-CH20 cross-sectional study.","We investigated the association between dietary intake and metabolic risk factors in children and adolescents within a semi-rural Malaysian community. Using an interviewer-led questionnaire, we surveyed 623 participants aged 7-18 from the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO). Anthropometric and blood pressure data were collected from all participants, while a subset (n = 162) provided blood samples for biomarker analysis, including fasting blood glucose (FBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Metabolic syndrome was determined using the International Diabetes Federation's Definition of Metabolic Syndrome in Children and Adolescents. Most participants were Malay (66.8%), with a median household income of MYR1,500 and a balanced sex distribution. Cereals, processed foods, beverages, fruits, and vegetables were commonly consumed. Obesity and abdominal obesity were prevalent, affecting more than a third of participants. Adherence to dietary recommendations was generally poor (ranging from 19.9 to 58.1%) and varied across age, sex, and ethnicity. Notably, some food groups displayed unexpected associations with health markers; for instance, fruit consumption was linked to abdominal obesity in children (abdominal obesity vs. normal: 2.4 servings/day vs. 1.6 servings/day). These findings emphasise the necessity of longitudinal studies to explore the complex relationship between diet and long-term health outcomes, including cardiometabolic diseases, while acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on data collection and analysis.",['Ramadas A; Rizal H; Rajakumar S; Mariapun J; Yasin MS; Armstrong MEG; Su TT'],2024,a subset of participants provided blood samples for biomarker analysis. a subset of participants provided blood samples for biomarker analysis. a sex distribution was a factor in the association between dietary intake and metabolic risk factors.
Rising tide: The global surge of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents demands action now.,"Childhood-onset obesity has emerged as a major public healthcare challenge across the globe, fueled by an obesogenic environment and influenced by both genetic and epigenetic predispositions. This has led to an exponential rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents. The looming wave of diabetes-related complications in early adulthood is anticipated to strain the healthcare budgets in most countries. Unless there is a collective global effort to curb the devastation caused by the situation, the impact is poised to be pro-found. A multifaceted research effort, governmental legislation, and effective social action are crucial in attaining this goal.

Microbial β-Glucuronidase Hydrogel Beads Activate Chemotherapeutic Prodrug.,"Bacteria-assisted chemotherapeutics have been highlighted as an alternative or supplementary approach to treating cancer. However, dynamic cancer-microbe studies at the <i>in vitro</i> level have remained a challenge to show the impact and effectiveness of microbial therapeutics due to the lack of relevant coculture models. Here, we demonstrate a hydrogel-based compartmentalized system for prodrug activation of a natural ingredient of licorice root, glycyrrhizin, by microbial β-glucuronidase (GUS). Hydrogel containment with <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> provides a favorable niche to encode GUS enzymes with excellent permeability and can serve as an independent ecosystem in the transformation of pro-apoptotic materials. Based on the confinement system of GUS expressing microbes, we quantitatively evaluated chemotherapeutic effects enhanced by microbial GUS enzyme in two dynamic coculture models <i>in vitro</i> (i.e., 2D monolayered cancer cells and 3D tumor spheroids). Our findings support the processes of prodrug conversion mediated by bacterial GUS enzyme which can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of a chemotherapy drug under dynamic coculture conditions. We expect our <i>in vitro</i> coculture platforms can be used for the evaluation of pharmacological properties and biological activity of xenobiotics as well as the potential impact of microbes on cancer therapeutics.",['Jeong Y; Han X; Vyas K; Irudayaraj J'],2024,dynamic cancer-microbe studies have remained a challenge to show the impact and effectiveness of microbial therapeutics due to the lack of relevant coculture models. i>in vitro/i> coculture platforms can be used for the evaluation of pharmacological properties and biological activity of xenobiotics.
From Planning Stage Towards FAIR Data: A Practical Metadatasheet For Biomedical Scientists.,"Datasets consist of measurement data and metadata. Metadata provides context, essential for understanding and (re-)using data. Various metadata standards exist for different methods, systems and contexts. However, relevant information resides at differing stages across the data-lifecycle. Often, this information is defined and standardized only at publication stage, which can lead to data loss and workload increase. In this study, we developed Metadatasheet, a metadata standard based on interviews with members of two biomedical consortia and systematic screening of data repositories. It aligns with the data-lifecycle allowing synchronous metadata recording within Microsoft Excel, a widespread data recording software. Additionally, we provide an implementation, the Metadata Workbook, that offers user-friendly features like automation, dynamic adaption, metadata integrity checks, and export options for various metadata standards. By design and due to its extensive documentation, the proposed metadata standard simplifies recording and structuring of metadata for biomedical scientists, promoting practicality and convenience in data management. This framework can accelerate scientific progress by enhancing collaboration and knowledge transfer throughout the intermediate steps of data creation.",['Seep L; Grein S; Splichalova I; Ran D; Mikhael M; Hildebrand S; Lauterbach M; Hiller K; Ribeiro DJS; Sieckmann K; Kardinal R; Huang H; Yu J; Kallabis S; Behrens J; Till A; Peeva V; Strohmeyer A; Bruder J; Blum T; Soriano-Arroquia A; Tischer D; Kuellmer K; Li Y; Beyer M; Gellner AK; Fromme T; Wackerhage H; Klingenspor M; Fenske WK; Scheja L; Meissner F; Schlitzer A; Mass E; Wachten D; Latz E; Pfeifer A; Hasenauer J'],2024,"metadata standards exist for different methods, systems and contexts. metadata standards are based on interviews with members of two biomedical consortia. metadata standards are based on systematic screening of data repositories."
Predicting the dynamics of organ failure in patients with acute pancreatitis depending on the mean platelet volume.,"The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between the blood serum mean platelet volume (MPV) and the dynamics of the OF course during the early phase in patients with moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis (AP). The predetermined criterion was the presence of the OF according to the revised Atlanta criteria 2012 for moderately severe and severe AP. A prospective sample of patients was stratified by severity, and two groups were defined based on MPV. Demographic indicators, comorbidities and clinical outcomes were compared between these groups. Multifactorial analysis determined whether an elevated MPV is independently associated with early OF and other unfavorable outcomes. Out of 108 patients, 20 had moderately severe AP and 88 had severe AP. The blood serum MPV, measured within 72 h of the onset of AP symptoms was lower 11.8 fL in 32 patients and equal to or greater 11.8 fL in 76 patients. Patients with elevated MPV were older (63 vs. 48 years), had obesity (59.2 % vs. 25 %), diabetes mellitus (DM) (51.3 % vs. 12.5 %), ischemic heart disease (70.8 % vs. 28.1 %) and more frequently experienced persistent OF (93.4 % vs. 53.1 %) compared to those with MPV lower 11.8 fL. The incidence of early OF increased proportionally with the severity of MPV (81.6 % vs. 34.4 % in the group with MPV lower 11.8 fL, Ptrend < 0.0001). In multifactorial analysis, adjusted for body mass index and DM, MPV equal to or greater 11.8 fL was independently associated with early OF. Elevated blood serum MPV of patients with AP are independently and proportionally correlated with early organ failure in patients with alcoholic and idiopathic etiology of AP. The study provides an evaluation of MPV as a prognostic marker for organ failure within the initial 7 days following the onset of acute pancreatitis symptoms. Additionally, alterations in MPV were identified in patients with acute pancreatitis who had diabetes or ischemic heart disease within the first 24 h of hospitalization.",['Levytskyi H; Sheiko V'],2024,"the predetermined criterion was the presence of the OF according to the revised Atlanta criteria 2012 for moderately severe and severe acute pancreatitis. the blood serum MPV, measured within 72 h of the onset of AP symptoms was lower 11.8 fL in 32 patients. the incidence of early OF increased proportionally with the severity of MPV (81.6 % vs. 34.4 % in the group with MPV lower 11.8 fL)"
Emerging Biohybrids of Aptamer-Based Nano-Biosensing Technologies for Effective Early Cancer Detection.,"Cancer is a leading global cause of mortality, which underscores the imperative of early detection for improved patient outcomes. Biorecognition molecules, especially aptamers, have emerged as highly effective tools for early and accurate cancer cell identification. Aptamers, with superior versatility in synthesis and modification, offer enhanced binding specificity and stability compared with conventional antibodies. Hence, this article reviews diagnostic strategies employing aptamer-based biohybrid nano-biosensing technologies, focusing on their utility in detecting cancer biomarkers and abnormal cells. Recent developments include the synthesis of nano-aptamers using diverse nanomaterials, such as metallic nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon-derived substances, and biohybrid nanostructures.

"The efficacy and tolerability of bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone induction therapy with a thalidomide dose step-up strategy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: A prospective observational study.","Thalidomide-containing regimens cause adverse events (AEs) that may require a reduction in treatment intensity or even treatment discontinuation in patients with multiple myeloma. As thalidomide toxicity is dose-dependent, identifying the most appropriate dose for each patient is essential. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a thalidomide dose step-up strategy on treatment response and progression-free survival (PFS). This prospective observational study included 93 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) who received bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTD). The present study assessed the incidence of thalidomide dose reduction and discontinuation, the overall dose intensity, and their effects on therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, this study used Cox proportional hazard models to analyze the factors contributing to thalidomide intolerability. The results showed the overall response rates in all patients and the evaluable patients were 78.5% and 98.7%, respectively. The median PFS in the study cohort was not reached. The most common thalidomide-related AEs were constipation (32.3%) and skin rash (23.7%), resulting in dose reduction and discontinuation rates of 22.6% and 21.5%, respectively. The responders had a significantly higher average thalidomide dose intensity than the nonresponders (88.6% vs. 42.9%, p < .001). The thalidomide dose step-up approach is a viable option for patients with NDMM receiving VTD induction therapy with satisfactory efficacy and tolerability. However, thalidomide intolerance may lead to dose reduction or discontinuation due to unpredictable AEs, leading to lower dose intensity and potentially inferior treatment outcomes. In addition to a dose step-up strategy, optimal supportive care is critical for patients with multiple myeloma receiving VTD induction therapy.",['Liao PW; Lu HJ; Chen TC; Lin HC; Shih YH; Teng CJ'],2024,"thalidomide-containing regimens cause adverse events (AEs) that may require a reduction in treatment intensity or even treatment discontinuation in patients with multiple myeloma. thalidomide dose step-up strategy is dose-dependent, identifying the most appropriate dose for each patient is essential."
Structural basis of pri-let-7 recognition by human pseudouridine synthase TruB1.,"Let-7 was one of the first microRNAs (miRNAs) to be discovered and its expression promotes differentiation during development and function as tumor suppressors in various cancers. The maturation process of let-7 miRNA is tightly regulated by multiple RNA-binding proteins. For example, LIN28 binds to the terminal loops of the precursors of let-7 family and block their processing into mature miRNAs. Trim25 promotes the uridylation-mediated degradation of pre-let-7 modified by LIN28/TUT4. Recently, human pseudouridine synthase TruB1 has been reported to facilitate let-7 maturation by directly binding to pri-let-7 and recruiting Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor. Through biochemical assay and structural investigation, we show that human TruB1 binds specifically the terminal loop of pri-let-7a1 at nucleotides 31-41, which folds as a small stem-loop architecture. Although TruB1 recognizes the terminal loop of pri-let-7a1 in a way similar to how E. coli TruB interacts with tRNA, a conserved KRKK motif in human and other higher eukaryotes adds an extra binding interface and strengthens the recognition of TruB1 for pri-let-7a1 through electrostatic interactions. These findings reveal the structural basis of TruB1-pri-let-7 interaction which may assists the elucidation of precise role of TruB1 in biogenesis of let-7.",['Xuan Y; Wang L; Zhang L; Lv M; Li F; Gong Q'],2024,let-7 miRNA is tightly regulated by multiple RNA-binding proteins.

"Associations of Abnormal Maternal Glucose Regulation in Pregnancy with Offspring Adiposity, Insulin Resistance, and Adipokine Markers during Childhood and Adolescence.","To examine the associations of abnormal maternal glucose regulation in pregnancy with offspring adiposity, insulin resistance, adipokine, and inflammatory markers during childhood and adolescence. Project Viva is a prospective pre-birth cohort (n = 2,128 live births) initiated from 1999 through 2002 in Eastern Massachusetts, US. During the second trimester of pregnancy, clinicians used two-step oral glucose challenge testing to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In the offspring, we measured anthropometry, insulin resistance, adipokines, lipids, and inflammatory markers in mid-childhood (n=1107), early adolescence (n=1027), and mid-adolescence (n=693). We used multivariable linear regression models and generalized estimating equations adjusted for child age and sex, and for maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, and smoking during pregnancy; we further adjusted for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). At mid-adolescence (17.1 [0.8] years old), offspring of mothers with GDM (n=27) had a higher BMI z-score (β; 95%Cl; 0.41 SD; 0.00, 0.82), sum of skinfolds (8.15 mm; 2.48, 13.82), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, 0.81 units; 0.13, 1.50), leptin z-score (0.40 SD; 0.01, 0.78), and leptin/adiponectin ratio z-score (0.51 SD; CI 0.09, 0.93) compared with offspring of mothers with normoglycemia (multivariable-adjusted models). The associations with BMI, (HOMA-IR), and adiponectin seemed stronger in mid-adolescence compared with earlier time points. The associations were attenuated towards the null after adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Exposure to GDM is associated with higher adiposity, insulin resistance, and altered adipokines in mid-adolescence. Our findings suggest that the peri-pubertal period could be a key time for the emergence of prenatally programmed metabolic abnormalities.",['Cho S; Rifas-Shiman SL; Harnois-Leblanc S; Aris IM; Oken E; Hivert MF'],2024,"project Viva is a prospective pre-birth cohort (n = 2,128 live births) initiated from 1999 through 2002 in eastern Massachusetts, us. in the offspring, we measured anthropometry, insulin resistance, adipokines, lipids, and inflammatory markers in mid-childhood, early adolescence, and mid-adolescence."
Cu superparticle-based aggregation induced enhancement strategy with PVDF-HFP/CeVO<sub>4</sub> NP sensing interface for miR-103a detection.,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has been widely used in research on electrochemiluminescence (ECL) due to its excellent luminescence intensity. In this work, copper superparticles (Cu SPs) were used to construct ECL biosensor to detect the microRNA-103a (miRNA-103a) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor tissues. Firstly, GSH-capped copper clusters were used as precursors to prepare Cu SPs by the AIE effect. Compared with clusters, Cu SPs possessed higher luminescence performance and energy stability, making them an ideal choice for ECL nanoprobe. The film of PVDF-HFP/CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs was constructed and modified with CPBA and GSH as the sensing interface (PCCG). The PCCG film displayed good conductivity and hydrophilicity, and desirable mechanical stability. Moreover, the PCCG film can induce high carrier mobility rates and dissociate large amounts of the co-reactant K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> to enhance the ECL intensity of Cu SPs. As a result, the prepared ECL sensor with the catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) strategy was employed to quantify miRNA-103a in the range of 100 fM to 100 nM. The biosensor provided a novel analytical approach for the clinical diagnosis of TNBC.",['Ji F; Wang P; Li Z; Ji K; Wang D; Ma Q'],2024,copper superparticles (Cu SPs) were used to construct a biosensor. the biosensor detected the microRNA-103a (miRNA-103a) in triple-negative breast cancer tissues. the biosensor provided a novel analytical approach for the clinical diagnosis of TNBC.

Factors associated with the efficacy of first-line nivolumab plus chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer patients with deficient mismatch repair.,"We aimed to investigate clinicopathologic factors leading to different clinical outcomes in patients with deficient mismatch repair protein (d-MMR) gastric cancer (GC) treated with nivolumab plus chemotherapy (nivolumab chemotherapy). This retrospective study included 28 patients with d-MMR advanced GC treated with first-line nivolumab chemotherapy. As a control group, 68 treated with first-line chemotherapy alone were included. Clinicopathological factors, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS), were analyzed with regards to the efficacy outcomes. Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer (median PFS; not reached [NR] vs. 5.2 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.28, P < 0.001), and overall survival (OS) tended to be longer (median OS; NR vs. 17.9 months, HR 0.43, P = 0.057) in patients treated with nivolumab chemotherapy than those treated with chemotherapy. The PFS benefit of nivolumab chemotherapy over chemotherapy was pronounced in the subgroup with a lower NLR (< 3.80 [median NLR]) (HR 0.10), whereas it was less prominent in patients with a high NLR (≥ 3.80) (HR 0.58). Among patients treated with nivolumab chemotherapy, PFS was worse in patients with a higher NLR (≥ 3.80) than in those with a lower NLR (< 3.80), and survival outcomes were similar between those with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 and < 5. Nivolumab chemotherapy was associated with better efficacy outcomes than chemotherapy alone among patients with d-MMR GC, but survival outcomes were poor even with nivolumab chemotherapy for those with a high NLR.

Ziyin Bushen Fang improves Diabetic Osteoporosis by Inhibiting Autophagy and Oxidative Stress <i>In vitro</i> and <i>In vivo</i>.,"Diabetic osteoporosis (DOP) belongs to the group of diabetes-induced secondary osteoporosis and is the main cause of bone fragility and fractures in many patients with diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether Ziyin Bushen Fang (ZYBSF) can improve DOP by inhibiting autophagy and oxidative stress. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) was induced in rats using a high-fat high-sugar diet combined with streptozotocin. Micro-CT scanning was used to quantitatively observe changes in the bone microstructure in each group. Changes in the serum metabolites of DOP rats were analyzed using UHPLC-QTOF-MS. The DOP mouse embryonic osteoblast precursor cell model (MC3T3-E1) was induced using high glucose levels. After ZYBSF treatment, bone microstructure significantly improved. The bone mineral density, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness in the ZYBSF-M and ZYBSF-H groups significantly increased. After ZYBSF treatment, the femur structure of the rats was relatively intact, collagen fibers were significantly increased, and osteoporosis was significantly improved. A total of 1239 metabolites were upregulated and 1527 were downregulated in the serum of T1DM and ZYBSF-treated rats. A total of 20 metabolic pathways were identified. In cellular experiments, ZYBSF reduced ROS levels and inhibited the protein expression of LC3II / I, Beclin-1, and p-ERK.

[Safety of patients undergoing radical resection combined with paclitaxel-based hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer].,"<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the safety of paclitaxel-based, hyperthermic, intraperitoneal perfusion chemotherapy (HIPEC) after radical resection of locally advanced gastric cancer. <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study of clinicopathological data of 467 patients with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who had been admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University between July 2019 and April 2021. Among these patients, 151 had undergone radical resection combined with post-operative paclitaxel-based HIPEC (surgery+HIPEC group) and 316 radical resection alone (surgery group). The adverse perioperative events in study patients were evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 5.0) published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients in the surgery+HIPEC group according to the number of times HIPEC was administered and the incidence of adverse events was compared between subgroups using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Independent risk factors for paclitaxel-based HIPEC-associated adverse events were identified by applying a logistic model. <b>Results:</b> In the surgery+HIPEC group, there were 113 (74.8%) male and 38 (25.2%) female patients of median age 64 (55, 68) years, 18 (11.9%), 79 (52.3%), and 54 (35.8%) of whom had undergone one, two, and three paclitaxel-based HIPEC treatments, respectively, after surgery. The median maximum tumor diameter was 5.0 (3.6, 6.5) cm. In the surgery group, there were 244 (77.2%) male and 72 (22.8%) female patients of median age 63 (54, 68) and the median maximum tumor diameter was 4.0 (3.0, 5.5) cm. In the surgery+HIPEC group, 112 patients (74.2%) had 198 Grade 2 or higher adverse perioperative events, postoperative hypoalbuminemia being the commonest (85 cases, 56.3%), followed by postoperative anemia (50 cases, 33.1%). Compared with the surgery group, the incidences of postoperative hypoalbuminemia (56.3% [85/151] vs. 37.7% [119/316], χ<sup>2</sup>=14.420, <i>P</i><0.001), anemia (33.1% [50/151] vs. 22.5% [71/316], χ<sup>2</sup>=6.030, <i>P</i>=0.014), abdominal pain [7.3% [11/151] vs. 1.6% [5/316], χ<sup>2</sup>=10.042, <i>P</i>=0.002) and abdominal distension (5.3% [8/151] vs. 1.3% [4/316], χ<sup>2</sup>=5.123, <i>P</i>=0.024) were all significantly higher in the surgery+HIPEC group. Analysis of the three HIPEC subgroups revealed significant differences in the incidences of postoperative hypoalbuminemia (13/18 vs. 67.1% [53/79] vs. 35.2% [19/54], χ<sup>2</sup>=12.955, <i>P</i><0.001) and pulmonary infection (6/18 vs. 6.3% [5/79] vs. 1.9% [1/54], χ<sup>2</sup>=13.232, <i>P</i><0.001) between them. Univariate analysis identified body mass index, Borrmann's type and number of HIPEC treatments as associated with perioperative adverse events in the surgery+HIPEC group (<i>P</i><0.05). However, according to multifactorial logistic analysis, the above factors were not independent risk factors for perioperative adverse events in the surgery+HIPEC group (<i>P</i>>0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Paclitaxel-based HIPEC after radical resection significantly increases the risk of postoperative hypoalbuminemia, anemia, abdominal pain, and abdominal distension in patients who have undergone excision of locally advanced gastric cancer. However, increasing the frequency of HIPEC treatments did not significantly increase the risk of paclitaxel-based HIPEC-related adverse events. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analysis did not identify any independent risk factors for paclitaxel HIPEC-related adverse events.",['Mei JX; Zhao LY; Zhang WH; Liu K; Chen XL; Yang K; Hu JK'],2024,151 patients had undergone radical resection combined with post-operative paclitaxel-based HIPEC. 316 radical resection alone (surgery group) were among those who had undergone radical resection.
Managing Inconsistent Bladder Volumes in the Prostate Cancer Patient Using Daily Online Adaptive RT: A Case Report.,"We report the use of online adaptive radiotherapy (OART) aiming to improve dosimetric parameters in the prostate cancer patient who had lower urinary tract symptoms that caused him not to adhere to the standard bladder filling protocol. The reference treatment plan for adaptive radiotherapy plan was generated for the pelvis and the solitary bony lesion using the Ethos treatment planning system. For each treatment session, high-quality iterative reconstructed cone beam CT (CBCT) images were acquired, and the system automatically generated an optimal adaptive plan after verification of contours. Image-guided RT (IGRT) plans were also created using the reference plan recalculated on the CBCT scan and were compared with adaptive plans. The reference bladder volume in the planning CT scan was 173 cc, and the mean bladder volume difference over the course was 25.4% ± 16.6%. The ART offered superior target coverage for PTV 70 Gy over online IGRT (V95: 90.5 ± 3.2 % Vs 97.3 ± 0.4%; p=0.000) and the bladder was also better spared from the high dose (V65 Gy: 17.9 ± 9.1% vs 14.8 ± 3.6%; p=0.03). However, the mean rectum V65 doses were very similar in both plans. Managing the inconsistent bladder volume was feasible in the prostate cancer patient using the CBCT-guided OART and our analysis confirmed that adaptive plans offered better target coverage while sparing the bladder from high radiation doses in comparison to online IGRT plans. radiotherapy, CBCT, online adaptive radiotherapy, image-guided RT.",['Gurusamy VM; Arunachalam YS; Poolakundan MR; Cabe SFM; Hammoud RW; Al-Hammadi N'],2024,adaptive radiotherapy plan was generated for the pelvis and the solitary bony lesion using the Ethos treatment planning system. image-guided RT plans were also created using the reference plan recalculated on the CBCT scan.
The evolution of precision oncology: The ongoing impact of the Drug Rediscovery Protocol (DRUP).,"The Drug Rediscovery Protocol (DRUP) is a Dutch, pan-cancer, nonrandomized clinical trial that aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of targeted and immunotherapies outside their registered indication in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Patients with advanced or metastatic cancer are eligible when there are no standard of care treatment options left and the tumor possesses a molecular genomic variant for which commercially available anticancer treatment is accessible off-label in DRUP. Clinical benefit is the study's primary endpoint, characterized by a confirmed objective response or stable disease after at least 16 weeks of treatment. More than 2,500 patients have undergone evaluation, of which over 1,500 have started treatment in DRUP. The overall clinical benefit rate (CBR) remains 33%. The nivolumab cohort for patients with microsatellite instable metastatic tumors proved highly successful with a CBR of 63%, while palbociclib or ribociclib in patients with tumors harboring CDK4/6 pathway alterations showed limited efficacy, with a CBR of 15%. The formation of two European initiatives (PCM4EU and PRIME-ROSE) strives to accelerate implementation and enhance data collection to broaden equitable access to anticancer treatments and gather more evidence. DRUP persists in improving patients access to off-label targeted or immunotherapy in the Netherlands and beyond. The expansion of DRUP-like clinical trials across Europe provides countless opportunities for broadening the horizon of precision oncology.",['Haj Mohammad SF; Timmer HJL; Zeverijn LJ; Geurts BS; Spiekman IAC; Verkerk K; Verbeek FAJ; Verheul HMW; Voest EE; Gelderblom H'],2024,"the drug rediscovery protocol (DRUP) is a nonrandomized clinical trial. the trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of targeted and immunotherapies outside their registered indication in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. more than 2,500 patients have undergone evaluation."
Mitochondria targeted esculetin administration improves insulin resistance and hyperglycemia-induced atherosclerosis in db/db mice.,"The development and progression of hyperglycemia (HG) and HG-associated atherosclerosis are exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction due to dysregulated mitochondria-derived ROS generation. We recently synthesized a novel mitochondria-targeted esculetin (Mito-Esc) and tested its dose-response therapeutic efficacy in mitigating HG-induced atherosclerosis in db/db mice. In comparison to simvastatin and pioglitazone, Mito-Esc administration resulted in a considerable reduction in body weights and improved glucose homeostasis, possibly by reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis, as indicated by a reduction in glycogen content, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) levels, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) activity. Interestingly, Mito-Esc treatment, by regulating phospho-IRS and phospho-AKT levels, greatly improved palmitate-induced insulin resistance, resulting in enhanced glucose uptake in adipocytes and HepG2 cells. Also, and importantly, Mito-Esc administration prevented HG-induced atheromatous plaque formation and lipid accumulation in the descending aorta. In addition, Mito-Esc administration inhibited the HG-mediated increase in VACM, ICAM, and MAC3 levels in the aortic tissue, as well as reduced the serum pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of senescence. In line with this, Mito-Esc significantly inhibited monocyte adherence to human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) treated with high glucose and reduced high glucose-induced premature senescence in HAECs by activating the AMPK-SIRT1 pathway. In contrast, Mito-Esc failed to regulate high glucose-induced endothelial cell senescence under AMPK/SIRT1-depleted conditions. Together, the therapeutic efficacy of Mito-Esc in the mitigation of hyperglycemia-induced insulin resistance and the associated atherosclerosis is in part mediated by potentiating the AMPK-SIRT1 axis. KEY MESSAGES: Mito-Esc administration significantly mitigates diabetes-induced atherosclerosis. Mito-Esc improves hyperglycemia (HG)-associated insulin resistance. Mito-Esc inhibits HG-induced vascular senescence and inflammation in the aorta. Mito-Esc-mediated activation of the AMPK-SIRT1 axis regulates HG-induced endothelial cell senescence.",['Singuru G; Pulipaka S; Shaikh A; Sahoo S; Jangam A; Thennati R; Kotamraju S'],2024,mitochondrial dysfunction exacerbated by dysregulated mitochondria-derived ROS generation. mitochondrial dysfunction is due to dysregulated mitochondria-derived ROS generation. mitochondrial dysfunction is exacerbated by mitochondrial dysfunction.
Ameliorative effect of Metformin / alpha-lipoic acid combination on diabetic nephropathy via modulation of YAP/ miR-29a/PTEN/p-AKT axis.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most frequent and serious complication of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Lack of a precise remedy and socio-economic burden of DN patients implements searching about alternative therapies. This study aims to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) alone or in combination with metformin (Met) in ameliorating STZ/High fat diet (HFD)-induced DN. T2DM was induced via HFD administration for 15 weeks and single ip injection of STZ (35 mg/kg) at week 7. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly grouped as follows: control group, STZ/HFD-induced DN, Met/T; daily treated with 150 mg/kg Met, α-LA/T group; daily treated with 100 mg/kg α-LA, and Met/T + α-LA/T group; daily treated with Met and α-LA at same doses. Administration of Met and α-LA succeeded in attenuating STZ/HFD-induced DN as manifested by significant decrease in kidney weight as well as renal and cardiac hypertrophy index. Moreover, Met and α-LA improved glycemic control, kidney functions and lipid profile as well as restored redox balance. Additionally, Met and α-LA administration significantly upregulated PTEN level accompanied by significant downregulation in renal p-AKT and miR-29a levels. Histopathologically, Met and α-LA administration mitigated STZ/HFD-induced histopathological alterations in kidney and heart. Moreover, immunohistochemical examination revealed a significant decrease in renal YAP, collagen I and Ki-67. Taken together, these observations revealed that Met and α-LA administration could protect against STZ/HFD-induced DN.",['Helmy SA; Nour OA; G Abd El Salam AS'],2024,DN is the most frequent and serious complication of type 2 diabetes. lack of a precise remedy and socio-economic burden of DN patients implements searching about alternative therapies.
International Criteria for Reporting Study Quality for Sudden Cardiac Arrest/Death Tool.,"Studies reporting on the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest and/or death (SCA/D) in athletes commonly lack methodological and reporting rigor, which has implications for screening and preventative policy in sport. To date, there are no tools designed for assessing study quality in studies investigating the incidence of SCA/D in athletes. The International Criteria for Reporting Study Quality for Sudden Cardiac Arrest/Death tool (IQ-SCA/D) was developed following a Delphi process. Sixteen international experts in sports cardiology were identified and invited. Experts voted on each domain with subsequent moderated discussion for successive rounds until consensus was reached for a final tool. Interobserver agreement between a novice, intermediate, and expert observer was then assessed from the scoring of 22 relevant studies using weighted and unweighted κ analyses. The final IQ-SCA/D tool comprises 8 domains with a summated score of a possible 22. Studies are categorized as low, intermediate, and high quality with summated IQ-SCA/D scores of ≤11, 12 to 16, and ≥17, respectively. Interrater agreement was ""substantial"" between all 3 observers for summated IQ-SCA/D scores and study categorization. The IQ-SCA/D is an expert consensus tool for assessing the study quality of research reporting the incidence of SCA/D in athletes. This tool may be used to assist researchers, reviewers, journal editors, and readers in contextualizing the methodological quality of different studies with varying athlete SCA/D incidence estimates. Importantly, the IQ-SCA/D also provides an expert-informed framework to support and guide appropriate design and reporting practices in future SCA/D incidence trials.","[""Edwards JJ; Compton C; Chatrath N; Petek BJ; Baggish A; Börjesson M; Chung E; Corrado D; Drezner JA; Gati S; Gray B; Kim J; La Gerche A; Malhotra A; Marijon E; Papadakis M; Pelliccia A; Phelan D; Semsarian C; Sharma S; Sharma R; O'Driscoll JM; Harmon KG""]",2024,studies reporting the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest and/or death lack methodological and reporting rigor. there are no tools designed for assessing study quality in studies investigating the incidence of SCA/D in athletes.
Association between the triglyceride-glucose index and all-cause and CVD mortality in the young population with diabetes.,"Although studies have demonstrated the value of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardiovascular mortality, however, few studies have shown that the TyG index is associated with all-cause or CVD mortality in young patients with diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG index and all-cause and CVD mortality in young patients with diabetes in the United States. Our study recruited 2440 young patients with diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2018. Mortality outcomes were determined by linking to National Death Index (NDI) records up to December 31, 2019. Cox regression modeling was used to investigate the association between TyG index and mortality in young patients with diabetes. The nonlinear association between TyG index and mortality was analyzed using restricted cubic splines (RCS), and a two-segment Cox proportional risk model was constructed for both sides of the inflection point. During a median follow-up period of 8.2 years, 332 deaths from all causes and 82 deaths from cardiovascular disease were observed. Based on the RCS, the TyG index was found to have a U-shaped association with all-cause and CVD mortality in young patients with diabetes, with threshold values of 9.18 and 9.16, respectively. When the TyG index was below the threshold value (TyG index < 9.18 in all-cause mortality and < 9.16 in CVD mortality), its association with all-cause and CVD mortality was not significant. When the TyG index was above the threshold (TyG index ≥ 9.18 in all-cause mortality and ≥ 9.16 in CVD mortality), it showed a significant positive association with all-cause mortality and CVD mortality (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05-2.96 for all-cause mortality and HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.05-5.38 for CVD mortality). Our results suggest a U-shaped association between TyG index and all-cause and CVD mortality among young patients with diabetes in the United States, with threshold values of 9.18 and 9.16 for CVD and all-cause mortality, respectively.",['Liu C; Liang D; Xiao K; Xie L'],2024,study recruited 2440 young patients with diabetes from the national health and nutrition examination survey. the nonlinear association between TyG index and mortality was analyzed using restricted cubic splines (RCS).
Depressive symptoms are not associated with clinically important levels of digital home blood pressure in the electronic Framingham Heart Study.,"Depressive symptoms are common and share many biopsychosocial mechanisms with hypertension. Association studies between depressive symptoms and blood pressure (BP) have been inconsistent. Home BP monitoring may provide insight. To investigate the association between depressive symptoms and digital home BP. Electronic Framingham Heart Study (eFHS) participants were invited to obtain a smartphone app and digital BP cuff at research exam 3 (2016-2019). Participants with ≥3 weeks of home BP measurements within 1 year were included. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Multivariable linear mixed models were used to test the associations of continuous CES-D score and dichotomous depressive symptoms (CES-D ≥16) (independent) with home BP (dependent), adjusting for age, sex, cohort, number of weeks since baseline, lifestyle factors, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Among 883 participants (mean age 54 years, 59% women, 91% White), the median CES-D score was 4. Depressive symptom prevalence was 7.6%. Mean systolic and diastolic BP at exam 3 were 119 and 76 mm Hg; hypertension prevalence was 48%. A 1 SD higher CES-D score was associated with 0.9 (95% CI: 0.18-1.56, <i>P</i> = .01) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.06-1.07, <i>P</i> = .03) mm Hg higher home systolic BP and diastolic BP, respectively.

Epidural analgesia during labour and severe maternal morbidity: population based study.,"To determine the effect of labour epidural on severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and to explore whether this effect might be greater in women with a medical indication for epidural analgesia during labour, or with preterm labour. Population based study. All NHS hospitals in Scotland. 567 216 women in labour at 24+0 to 42+6 weeks' gestation between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2019, delivering vaginally or through unplanned caesarean section. The primary outcome was SMM, defined as the presence of ≥1 of 21 conditions used by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as criteria for SMM, or a critical care admission, with either occurring at any point from date of delivery to 42 days post partum (described as SMM). Secondary outcomes included a composite of ≥1 of the 21 CDC conditions and critical care admission (SMM plus critical care admission), and respiratory morbidity. Of the 567 216 women, 125 024 (22.0%) had epidural analgesia during labour. SMM occurred in 2412 women (4.3 per 1000 births, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.1 to 4.4). Epidural analgesia was associated with a reduction in SMM (adjusted relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85), SMM plus critical care admission (0.46, 0.29 to 0.73), and respiratory morbidity (0.42, 0.16 to 1.15), although the last of these was underpowered and had wide confidence intervals. Greater risk reductions in SMM were detected among women with a medical indication for epidural analgesia (0.50, 0.34 to 0.72) compared with those with no such indication (0.67, 0.43 to 1.03; P<0.001 for difference). More marked reductions in SMM were seen in women delivering preterm (0.53, 0.37 to 0.76) compared with those delivering at term or post term (1.09, 0.98 to 1.21; P<0.001 for difference). The observed reduced risk of SMM with epidural analgesia was increasingly noticeable as gestational age at birth decreased in the whole cohort, and in women with a medical indication for epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia during labour was associated with a 35% reduction in SMM, and showed a more pronounced effect in women with medical indications for epidural analgesia and with preterm births. Expanding access to epidural analgesia for all women during labour, and particularly for those at greatest risk, could improve maternal health.",['Kearns RJ; Kyzayeva A; Halliday LOE; Lawlor DA; Shaw M; Nelson SM'],2024,567 216 women in labour at 24+0 to 42+6 weeks' gestation. primary outcome was 1 of 21 conditions used by the CDC. secondary outcomes included a composite of 1 of 21 conditions.
"Epidemiological, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Morocco: A Case Series and Review of Literature.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor. It is considered a global public health problem given its incidence and high mortality rate. Epidemiological studies on hepatocellular carcinoma in our Moroccan and North African contexts are rare. Hence, our study aims to determine the epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical, etiological and therapeutic aspects of this pathology in our context. We conducted a descriptive retrospective study on patients with HCC treated by the Hepato-gastroenterology department of the university hospital of Mohammed VI in Marrakech over a period of 7 years spread between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2021. The epidemiological characteristics, diagnostic methods and therapeutic management of HCC in these patients have been described and analyzed. 100 patients with HCC were identified and included in our study. The average age was 63.3 ± 12.63 years with a male predominance. The predominant etiology was cirrhosis (87% of cases) then viral hepatitis C (35%) and B (27%) and of unknown origin in 29% of cases. HCC revealed cirrhosis in 41% and was diagnosed during cirrhosis surveillance in 36% of cases. The functional signs were dominated by abdominal pain (68%), deterioration of general condition (58%) and abdominal distension (43%). Alfa-fetoprotein was elevated in 73% of cases and was above 400ng/ml in 41% of cases. The diagnosis was mainly radiological in 92% and histological in 8% of cases. The radiological aspects of HCC were dominated by mononodular form (58%), a right lobar location (80%), a diameter greater than 5 cm (58%), a typical vascular aspect (86%) with portal thrombosis in 24% and metastases in 36% of cases, especially in lymph nodes. The majority of cirrhosis in our series was classified as Child-Pugh stage B (46%) at the time of diagnosis and most patients had an advanced stage of HCC with 31% at BCLC C and 28% at BCLC D. 72% of patients received palliative treatment, and only 6% received curative treatment. At the end of the study, 48% of patients had died with an overall survival of 6.5 months. Our study achieved its main objective by providing a snapshot of HCC in our context and confirmed that HCC remains with poor prognosis since its diagnosis is often late, limiting the therapeutic choices with a very short median survival. It also noted that the viral etiology remains the main cause of HCC in our population. Therefore, prevention remains the best therapeutic approach against HCC and the need for a national or at least a regional HCC registry in our country is essential in order to develop targeted preventive measures adapted to our context and to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for our patients.",['Zouaki I; Aiterrami A; Samlani Z; Oubaha S; Krati K'],2024,hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor. it is considered a global public health problem given its incidence and high mortality rate. a retrospective retrospective study on patients with HCC was conducted.
Discovery of first-in-class highly selective TRPV1 antagonists with dual analgesic and hypoglycemic effects.,"Analgesia and blood sugar control are considered as two main unmet clinical needs for diabetes related neuropathic pain patients. Transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channel is a highly validated target for pain perception, while no TRPV1 antagonists have been approved due to hyperthermia side effects. Herein, two series of new TRPV1 antagonists with flavonoid skeleton were designed by the structure-based drug design (SBDD) strategy. After comprehensive evaluation, compound CX-3 was identified as a promising TRPV1 antagonist. CX-3 exhibited equivalent TRPV1 antagonistic activity with classical TRPV1 antagonist BCTC in vitro, and exerted better analgesic activity in vivo than that of BCTC in the formalin induced inflammatory pain model without hyperthermia risk. Moreover, CX-3 exhibited robust glucose-lowering effects and showed high selectivity over other ion channels. Overall, these findings identified a first-in-class highly selective TRPV1 antagonist CX-3, which is a promising candidate to target the pathogenesis of diabetes related neuropathic pain.",['Liu C; Wang W; Zhao S; Chen S; Chen H; Wang S; Li Z; Qian H; Tian X'],2024,no TRPV1 antagonists have been approved due to hyperthermia side effects. a first-in-class highly selective TRPV1 antagonist is identified.
Modification of Rapid Papanicolaou Stain with Phloxine: A Study Assessing the Utility in Gynecological Smears.,"Rapidity and reliability are the major advantages of cytopathology in tumor diagnosis. The need for minimal turnaround time for assessing cytological smears has encouraged innovations in staining techniques that require lesser staining time with unequivocal cell morphology. Rapid Pap staining was introduced as a hybrid to conventional Pap stain. It improves staining quality, gets over the staining time in restriction, and is a more efficient technique financially. In the present study, a modified staining technique was adopted where phloxine is added as one of the cytoplasmic stain components in rapid Pap stain kits. The aim of this study was to assess whether the modification of the existing procedure by adding phloxine as one of the components of the cytoplasmic stain intensifies the cytoplasmic differentiation and cytoplasmic staining in gynecological smears. This was a prospective study done on 50 cases of gynecological smears. Two smears were collected from each patient and fixed in 100% propanol and stained with the rapid Pap stain kit procedure and modified rapid Pap stain with phloxine. Slides were then analyzed by two pathologists blinded to the staining method used. Five parameters were considered and scored (background, cell morphology, nuclear staining, cytoplasmic differentiation, and cytoplasmic staining). The quality index for each method was calculated by finding out the ratio of the actual score obtained to the maximum score possible. Both the staining methods had comparable results. For both pathologists, the quality index calculated for modified Pap stain was found to be marginally higher than the quality index for rapid Pap. The mean quality index was comparable for modified Pap (0.91) and rapid Pap (0.89). The efficacy of modified Pap stain with phloxine to distinctly stain the cytoplasm is comparable with that of rapid Pap stain. In addition, the intensity of staining can be enhanced with little cost outlay, and this can be especially beneficial in low-resource settings.",['Kaur R; Somal PK; Kalra SK; Sharma A; Sancheti S'],2024,"rapid pap staining was introduced as a hybrid to conventional Pap stain. it improves staining quality, gets over staining time in restriction. phloxine is added as one of the cytoplasmic stain components in rapid Pap stain kits."
Navigating practical challenges in immunotherapy for metastatic triple negative breast cancer.,"Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer therapy and now represents a standard of care for many tumor types, including triple-negative breast cancer.

Twelve-week, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of adults with T2D using ≥0.2 units/kg/day of insulin and elevated glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥64 mmol/mol (8.0%). Following a 2-week blinded CGM run-in phase, participants were randomised to rtCGM or control (self-monitoring blood glucose [SMBG]). The primary outcome was time in the target glucose range (3.9-10 mmol/L; TIR) during weeks 10-12, with data collected by blinded rtCGM in the control group. Sixty-seven participants entered the RCT phase (54% Māori, 57% female), median age 53 (range 16-70 years), HbA1c 85 (IQR 74, 94) mmol/mol (9.9 [IQR 8.9, 10.8]%), body mass index (36.7 ± 7.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Mean (±SD) TIR increased from 37 (24)% to 53 (24)% [Δ 13%; 95% CI 4.2 to 22; P = 0.007] in the rtCGM group but did not change in the SMBG group [45 (21)% to 45 (25)%, Δ 2.5%, 95% CI -6.1 to 11, P = 0.84]. Baseline-adjusted between-group difference in TIR was 10.4% [95% CI -0.9 to 21.7; P = 0.070].

Heterogeneity in DNA content has also been reported in human colorectal cancer; however, little is known about how such heterogeneity changes with radiotherapy or how it affects cancer radioresistance. In the present study, we established radioresistant clone SW480RR cells after fractionated X-ray irradiation of human colorectal cancer-derived SW480.hu cells, which are composed of two cell populations with different chromosome numbers, and examined how cellular radioresistance changed with fractionated radiotherapy. Compared with the parental cell population, which mostly comprised cells with higher ploidy, the radioresistant clones showed lower ploidy and less initial DNA damage. The lower ploidy cells in the parental cell population were identified as having radioresistance prior to irradiation; thus, SW480RR cells were considered intrinsically radioresistant cells selected from the parental population through fractionated irradiation. This study presents a practical example of the emergence of radioresistant cells from a cell population with ploidy heterogeneity after irradiation. The most likely mechanism is the selection of an intrinsically radioresistant population after fractionated X-ray irradiation, with a background in which lower ploidy cells exhibit lower initial DNA damage.",['Yamashita K; Yasui H; Bo T; Fujimoto M; Inanami O'],2024,radioresistant cancer cells are risk factors for recurrence after radiotherapy. heterogeneity in DNA content has also been reported in colorectal cancer. but little is known about how such heterogeneity changes with radiotherapy.
"Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol.","The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months. This review protocol aims to systematically examine and assess the factors that impact the access, utilisation, and standard of primary healthcare services for diabetes in West Africa.",['Abdul-Samed AB; Peprah EB; Jahan Y; Reichenberger V; Balabanova D; Mirzoev T; Lawson H; Odei E; Antwi E; Agyepong I'],2024,"an estimated 24 million africans have diabetes, with rates in west africa around 2-6%. over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank)"
ULK1 Mediated Autophagy-Promoting Effects of Rutin-Loaded Chitosan Nanoparticles Contribute to the Activation of NF-κB Signaling Besides Inhibiting EMT in Hep3B Hepatoma Cells.,"Liver cancer remains to be one of the leading causes of cancer worldwide. The treatment options face several challenges and nanomaterials have proven to improve the bioavailability of several drug candidates and their applications in nanomedicine. Specifically, chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are extremely biodegradable, pose enhanced biocompatibility and are considered safe for use in medicine. CNPs were synthesized by ionic gelation, loaded with rutin (rCNPs) and characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The rCNPs were tested for their cytotoxic effects on human hepatoma Hep3B cells, and experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of such effects. Further, the biocompatibility of the rCNPs was tested on L929 fibroblasts, and their hemocompatibility was determined. Initially, UV-vis and FTIR analyses indicated the possible loading of rutin on rCNPs. Further, the rutin load was quantitatively measured using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and the concentration was 88 µg/mL for 0.22 micron filtered rCNPs. The drug loading capacity (LC%) of the rCNPs was observed to be 13.29 ± 0.68%, and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was 19.55 ± 1.01%. The drug release was pH-responsive as 88.58% of the drug was released after 24 hrs at the lysosomal pH 5.5, whereas 91.44% of the drug was released at physiological pH 7.4 after 102 hrs. The cytotoxic effects were prominent in 0.22 micron filtered samples of 5 mg/mL rutin precursor. The particle size for the rCNPs at this concentration was 144.1 nm and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.244, which is deemed to be ideal for tumor targeting. A zeta potential (ζ-potential) value of 16.4 mV indicated rCNPs with good stability. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for the cytotoxic effects of rCNPs on human hepatoma Hep3B cells was 9.7 ± 0.19 μg/mL of rutin load. In addition, the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were observed. Gene expression studies indicated that the mechanism for cytotoxic effects of rCNPs on Hep3B cells was due to the activation of Unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase (ULK1) mediated autophagy and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling besides inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT). In addition, the rCNPs were less toxic on NCTC clone 929 (L929) fibroblasts in comparison to the Hep3B cells and possessed excellent hemocompatibility (less than 2% of hemolysis). The synthesized rCNPs were pH-responsive and possessed the physicochemical properties suitable for tumor targeting. The particles were effectively cytotoxic on Hep3B cells in comparison to normal cells and possessed excellent hemocompatibility. The very low hemolytic profile of rCNPs indicates that the drug could be administered intravenously for cancer therapy.",['Wu P; Wang X; Yin M; Zhu W; Chen Z; Zhang Y; Jiang Z; Shi L; Zhu Q'],2024,chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are extremely biodegradable and pose enhanced biocompatibility. the rCNPs were tested for their cytotoxic effects on human hepatoma Hep3B cells.
Assessment of gene-disease associations and recommendations for genetic testing for somatic variants in vascular anomalies by VASCERN-VASCA.,"Vascular anomalies caused by somatic (postzygotic) variants are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases with overlapping or distinct entities. The genetic knowledge in this field is rapidly growing, and genetic testing is now part of the diagnostic workup alongside the clinical, radiological and histopathological data. Nonetheless, access to genetic testing is still limited, and there is significant heterogeneity across the approaches used by the diagnostic laboratories, with direct consequences on test sensitivity and accuracy. The clinical utility of genetic testing is expected to increase progressively with improved theragnostics, which will be based on information about the efficacy and safety of the emerging drugs and future molecules. The aim of this study was to make recommendations for optimising and guiding the diagnostic genetic testing for somatic variants in patients with vascular malformations. Physicians and lab specialists from 11 multidisciplinary European centres for vascular anomalies reviewed the genes identified to date as being involved in non-hereditary vascular malformations, evaluated gene-disease associations, and made recommendations about the technical aspects for identification of low-level mosaicism and variant interpretation. A core list of 24 genes were selected based on the current practices in the participating laboratories, the ISSVA classification and the literature. In total 45 gene-phenotype associations were evaluated: 16 were considered definitive, 16 strong, 3 moderate, 7 limited and 3 with no evidence. This work provides a detailed evidence-based view of the gene-disease associations in the field of vascular malformations caused by somatic variants. Knowing both the gene-phenotype relationships and the strength of the associations greatly help laboratories in data interpretation and eventually in the clinical diagnosis. This study reflects the state of knowledge as of mid-2023 and will be regularly updated on the VASCERN-VASCA website (VASCERN-VASCA, https://vascern.eu/groupe/vascular-anomalies/ ).",['Revencu N; Eijkelenboom A; Bracquemart C; Alhopuro P; Armstrong J; Baselga E; Cesario C; Dentici ML; Eyries M; Frisk S; Karstensen HG; Gene-Olaciregui N; Kivirikko S; Lavarino C; Mero IL; Michiels R; Pisaneschi E; Schönewolf-Greulich B; Wieland I; Zenker M; Vikkula M'],2024,"genetic testing is now part of the diagnostic workup alongside clinical, radiological and histopathological data. access to genetic testing is still limited, with direct consequences on test accuracy and sensitivity. aim of this study was to make recommendations for optimising and guiding the diagnostic genetic testing for somatic variants in patients with vascular malformations."

Radiologic Occult Metastases in Pancreatic Cancer: Analysis of Risk Factors and Survival Outcomes in the Age of Contemporary Neoadjuvant Multi-agent Chemotherapy.,"Radiologic occult metastatic disease (ROMD) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who undergo contemporary neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has not been well studied. This study sought to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and oncologic outcomes for patients who underwent the NAC approach for PDAC. A retrospective review analyzed a prospectively maintained database of patients who had potentially resectable PDAC treated with NAC and were offered pancreatectomy at our institution from 2011 to 2022. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess risk factors associated with ROMD. Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank analyses were generated to estimate time-to-event end points. The study enrolled 366 patients. Upfront and borderline resectable anatomic staging comprised 80% of the cohort, whereas 20% had locally advanced disease. The most common NAC regimen was FOLFIRINOX (n = 274, 75%). For 55 patients (15%) who harbored ROMD, the most common site was liver-only metastases (n = 33, 60%). The independent risk factors for ROMD were increasing CA19-9 levels during NAC (odds ratio [OR], 7.01; confidence interval [CI], 1.97-24.96; p = 0.008), indeterminate liver lesions (OR, 2.19; CI, 1.09-4.39; p = 0.028), and enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes (OR, 6.87; CI, 2.07-22.74; p = 0.002) on preoperative cross-sectional imaging. Receipt of palliative chemotherapy (p < 0.001) and eventual formal pancreatectomy (p = 0.04) were associated with survival benefit in the log-rank analysis. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients with ROMD was nearly 15 months from the initial diagnosis, with radiologic evidence of metastases occurring after a median of 2 months. Radiologic occult metastatic disease remains a clinical challenge associated with poor outcomes for patients who have PDAC treated with multi-agent NAC.",['Yee EJ; Torphy RJ; Thielen ON; Easwaran L; Franklin O; Sugawara T; Bartsch C; Garduno N; McCarter MM; Ahrendt SA; Schulick RD; Del Chiaro M'],2024,radiologic occult metastatic disease (ROMD) in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has not been well studied. a retrospective review analyzed a prospectively maintained database of patients who had potentially resectable PDAC treated with NAC.
IL-33/NF-κB/ST2L/Rab37 positive-feedback loop promotes M2 macrophage to limit chemotherapeutic efficacy in lung cancer.,"IL-33 is a danger signal that binds to its receptor ST2L to promote tumor progression. This study identifies the IL-33/ST2L positive-feedback loop and the trafficking of ST2L membrane presentation in macrophages that contribute to lung tumor progression. Mechanistically, IL-33 induces ST2L upregulation by activating NF-κB, which binds to the promoter region of the ST2L gene. Moreover, Rab37, a small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking, mediates ST2L trafficking to the plasma membrane of M2 macrophages. This IL-33/NF-κB/ST2L/Rab37 axis promotes positive-feedback loops that enhance ST2L expression and membrane trafficking in M2 macrophages. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against IL-33 or ST2L block NF-κB activity, suppress M2 macrophage polarization, and synergistically inhibit tumor growth when combined with cisplatin treatment in vitro/vivo. Clinically, Rab37<sup>+</sup>/ST2L<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating M2 macrophages correlate with advanced-stage lung cancer patients with poor response to chemotherapy. These findings unveil a positive-feedback mechanism and provide a basis for IL-33/ST2L-targeting therapy for cancer.",['Yang YE; Hu MH; Zeng YC; Tseng YL; Chen YY; Su WC; Chang CP; Wang YC'],2024,IL-33/ST2L binds to its receptor ST2L to promote tumor progression.

Development and status quo of digestive endoscopy in China: An analysis based on the national census in 2013 and 2020.,"Technique and practice of digestive endoscopy are undergoing speedy development all over the world. This study aimed to evaluate its status quo and development in China. All hospitals performing digestive endoscopy in mainland China participated in the national census in 2013 and 2020. Retrospective data of hospitals, endoscopists, volumes, and qualities were collected via an online structured questionnaire, and its accuracy and rationality were verified by logical tests and manual reviews. Data from other countries were used to compare with that of China. From 2012 to 2019, the number of hospitals performing digestive endoscopy increased from 6,128 to 7,470 (1.22-fold), in which primary healthcare played a minor role. The median hospitals per 100,000 inhabitants per provincial region increased from 0.49 (IQR, 0.39-0.57) to 0.55 (IQR, 0.49-0.63). The endoscopists increased from 26,203 to 39,638 (1.51-fold), but their average workload even expanded. Overall volume increased from 28.8 million to 44.5 million (1.55-fold), and most types of endoscopic procedures recorded a high growth rate. Contrastingly, the specific utilization rates were low and paled in comparison with some developed countries. Nationwide, regional utilization rates showed a significant correlation with GDP per capita (<i>P</i> <0.001). Overall qualities of digestive endoscopy were excellent, but certain results of quality indicators posed a huge challenge, such as the detection rates of adenoma and early cancers. Impressive progress has been made in digestive endoscopy with rapidly expanding economy in China.

The ""LINKED-HEARTS Program"" (a Cardiometabolic Health Program LINKED with Community Health WorkErs and Mobile HeAlth TelemonitoRing To reduce Health DisparitieS""), is a multi-level intervention that includes home blood pressure (BP) monitoring (HBPM), blood glucose telemonitoring, and team-based care. This study aims to examine the effect of the LINKED-HEARTS Program intervention in improving BP control compared to enhanced usual care (EUC) and to evaluate the reach, adoption, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of the program. Using a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation design, 428 adults with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg) and diabetes or CKD will be recruited from 18 primary care practices, including community health centers, in Maryland. Using a cluster-randomized trial design, practices are randomly assigned to the LINKED-HEARTS intervention arm or EUC arm. Participants in the LINKED-HEARTS intervention arm receive training on HBPM, BP and glucose telemonitoring, and community health worker and pharmacist telehealth visits on lifestyle modification and medication management over 12 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with controlled BP (<140/90 mm Hg) at 12 months. The study tests a multi-level intervention to control multiple chronic diseases.

Cemiplimab-Induced Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State With Concurrent Diabetic Ketoacidosis in a Patient Receiving Treatment for Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"The immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) cemiplimab is a human monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy. Although cemiplimab shows excellent efficacy with a good tolerability profile, it can cause side effects, including potentially life-threatening endocrinopathies.

Assessing Glycosylated Hemoglobin Thresholds for Development of Cardiovascular Disease by Racial and Ethnic Groups.,"Diabetes is the strongest risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and although glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are known to vary by race, no racial and ethnic-specific diagnostic thresholds exist for diabetes in prediction of cardiovascular disease events. The purpose of this study is to determine whether HbA1c thresholds for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) differ among racial and ethnic groups. This is a retrospective cohort study of Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult members (n=309 636) with no history of cardiovascular disease who had HbA1c values and race and ethnicity data available between 2014 and 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the odds of MACEs by the following racial and ethnic groups: Filipino, South Asian, East Asian, Black, White, and Hispanic. A Youden index was used to calculate HbA1c thresholds for MACE prediction by each racial and ethnic group, stratified by sex. Among studied racial and ethnic groups, South Asian race was associated with the greatest odds of MACEs (1.641 [95% CI, 1.456-1.843]; <i>P</i><0.0001). HbA1c was a positive predictor for MACEs, with an odds ratio of 1.024 (95% CI, 1.022-1.025) for each 0.1% increment increase in HbA1c. HbA1c values varied between 6.0% and 7.6% in MACE prediction by race and ethnicity and sex. White individuals, South Asian individuals, East Asian women, and Black men had HbA1c thresholds for MACE prediction in the prediabetic range, between 6.0% and 6.2%. Black women, Hispanic men, and East Asian men had HbA1c thresholds of 6.2% to 6.6%, less than the typical threshold of 7.0% that is used as a treatment goal.

Adjuvant Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Curative Treatment: Several Unanswered Questions.,"Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a poor prognosis. Hepatectomy and local ablation are the main curative treatments for HCC. Nevertheless, the recurrence rate after hepatectomy or ablation is up to 70%, which seriously affects patient prognosis. Several adjuvant therapies have been explored to reduce postoperative recurrence. However, although a variety of adjuvant therapies have been shown to reduce the recurrence rate and improve overall survival, a standard consensus of national HCC guidelines for adjuvant treatment is lacking. Therefore, there are significant differences in the recommendations for adjuvant therapy for HCC between the Eastern and Western guidelines. A variety of adjuvant treatment methods, such as antiviral therapy, transarterial chemoembolization or traditional Chinese medicine, are recommended by the Chinese HCC guidelines. However, Western guidelines make few recommendations other than antiviral therapy.

Construction and Validation of Novel Ferroptosis-related Risk Score Signature and Prognostic Prediction Nomogram for Patients with Colorectal Cancer.,"<b>Background:</b> Colorectal cancer (CRC) has a high morbidity and mortality. Ferroptosis is a phenomenon in which metabolism and cell death are closely related. The role of ferroptosis-related genes in the progression of CRC is still not clear. Therefore, we screened and validated the ferroptosis-related genes which could determine the prevalence, risk and prognosis of patients with CRC. <b>Methods:</b> We firstly screened differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Then, these genes were used to construct a risk-score model using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm. The function and prognosis of the ferroptosis-related genes were confirmed using multi-omics analysis. The gene expression results were validated using publicly available databases and qPCR. We also used publicly available data and ferroptosis-related genes to construct a prognostic prediction nomogram. <b>Results:</b> A total of 24 differential expressed genes associated with ferroptosis were screened in this study. A three-gene risk score model was then established based on these 24 genes and GPX3, CDKN2A and SLC7A11 were selected. The significant prognostic value of this novel three-gene signature was also assessed. Furthermore, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis on cell lines and tissues, and validated the high expression of CDKN2A, GPX3 and low expression of SLC7A11 in CRC cells. The observed mRNA expression of GPX3, CDKN2A and SLC7A11 was consistent with the predicted outcomes. Besides, eight variables including selected ferroptosis related genes were included to establish the prognostic prediction nomogram for patients with CRC. The calibration plots showed favorable consistency between the prediction of the nomogram and actual observations. Also, the time-dependent AUC (>0.7) indicated satisfactory discriminative ability of the nomogram. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present study constructed and validated a novel ferroptosis-related three-gene risk score signature and a prognostic prediction nomogram for patients with CRC. Also, we screened and validated the ferroptosis-related genes GPX3, CDKN2A, and SLC7A11 which could serve as novel biomarkers for patients with CRC.",['Liu R; Wang Y; Bu J; Li Q; Chen F; Zhu M; Chi H; Yu G; Zhu T; Zhu X; Zhao G'],2024,ferroptosis is a phenomenon in which metabolism and cell death are closely related. the role of ferroptosis-related genes in the progression of CRC is still not clear. we screened and validated the ferroptosis-related genes.
Low birthweight in patients with type 2 diabetes is associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.,"Low birthweight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and CVD. This prospective cohort study investigated whether lower birthweight increases CVD risk after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Original midwife records were evaluated for 8417 participants recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) cohort. Patients were followed for the first occurrence of a composite CVD endpoint (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, unstable angina, heart failure or CVD death), a three-component endpoint comprising major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and all-cause mortality. Ten-year risks were estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator considering non-CVD death as a competing risk. HRs were determined by Cox regression. Models were controlled for sex, age, calendar year at birth, family history of diabetes and born-at-term status. A total of 1187 composite CVD endpoints, 931 MACE, and 1094 deaths occurred during a median follow-up period of 8.5 years. The 10-year standardised composite CVD risk was 19.8% in participants with a birthweight <3000 g compared with 16.9% in participants with a birthweight of 3000-3700 g, yielding a risk difference (RD) of 2.9% (95% CI 0.4, 5.4) and an adjusted HR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.03, 1.40). The 10-year MACE risk for birthweight <3000 g was similarly elevated (RD 2.4%; 95% CI 0.1, 4.7; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01, 1.46). The elevated CVD risk was primarily driven by stroke, peripheral arterial disease and CVD death. All-cause mortality showed no substantial difference. Having a birthweight <3000 g is associated with higher CVD risk among patients with type 2 diabetes, driven primarily by risk of stroke and CVD death.",['Hansen AL; Brøns C; Engelhard LM; Andersen MK; Hansen T; Nielsen JS; Vestergaard P; Højlund K; Jessen N; Olsen MH; Sørensen HT; Thomsen RW; Vaag A'],2024,prospective cohort study investigated whether lower birthweight increases CVD risk after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. patients followed for the first occurrence of a composite CVD endpoint. a three-component endpoint comprising major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)

Ultrasonographic Detective Flow Imaging for Evaluating Parathyroid Adenoma in Patients with Primary Hyperparathyroidism.,"Detective flow imaging (DFI) is a new imaging technology that displays low-velocity blood flow, which is difficult to visualize on conventional color Doppler ultrasonography (CDU). In this study, we compared the usefulness of DFI with that of CDU and methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) scintigraphy for detecting parathyroid adenoma (PA) in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). From March 2021 to March 2023, 87 PHPT patients underwent surgery, and 66 had a single PA. We performed preoperative conventional ultrasonography with CDU, MIBI scintigraphy, and DFI for 42 patients (5 males and 37 females; mean age: 61.6 ± 15.4 years). MIBI scintigraphy detected PA in 85.7% (36/42) patients, and both CDU and DFI detected PA in all patients. The rates of vascularity in PA detected by CDU and DFI were 71.4% (30/42) and 85.7% (36/42), respectively.

In-beam PET monitoring of proton therapy: a method for filtering prompt radiation events.,"In-beam Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a promising technology for real-time monitoring of proton therapy. Random coincidences between prompt radiation events and positron annihilation photon pairs can deteriorate imaging quality during beam-on operation. This study aimed to improve the PET image quality by filtering out the prompt radiation events. We investigated a prompt radiation event filtering method based on the accelerator radio frequency (RF) phase and assessed its performance using various prompt gamma energy thresholds. An in-beam PET prototype was used to acquire the data when the 70 MeV proton beam irradiated a water phantom and a mouse. The signal-to-background ratio indicator was utilized to evaluate the quality of the PET reconstruction image. The selection of the prompt gamma energy threshold will affect the quality of the reconstructed image. Using the optimal energy threshold of 580 keV can obtain a signal-to-background ratio of 1.6 times for the water phantom radiation experiment and 2.0 times for the mouse radiation experiment compared to those without background removal, respectively. Our results show that using this optimal threshold can reduce the prompt radiation events, enhancing the signal-to-background ratio of the reconstructed image. This advancement contributes to more accurate real-time range verification in subsequent steps.",['Ma Q; Yang Z; Mu D; Gao M; Zhang R; Wan L; Qiu A; Xie Q'],2024,in-beam PET prototype was used to acquire data when a proton beam irradiated a water phantom and a mouse. prompt radiation events can deteriorate imaging quality during beam-on operation.
Age Impacts Clinical and Patient Reported Outcomes following Post Mastectomy Breast Reconstruction.,"While the current literature indicates that age should not be a deterring factor in postmastectomy breast reconstruction (PMBR), the true impact of increasing age on postoperative outcomes remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of age on complications and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using BREAST-Q longitudinally 5-years after PMBR. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent autologous (ABR) or implant-based reconstruction (IBR). Age was studied as both a categorical and continuous variable. Outcome measures included complications and BREAST-Q scores at preoperative, 6-months, and 1-5 years postoperative. 4,730 patients were included, of which 1,536 (32.5%) underwent ABR while 3,194 (67.5%) had IBR. Older age was significantly associated with increased risk of developing mastectomy skin flap/nipple necrosis, infection, and seroma. Older age was negatively correlated with Satisfaction with Breasts (β=-0.06 [-0.12, -0.01]; p=0.033) and positively correlated with Psychosocial Well-being (β=0.14 [0.09, 0.20]; p<0.001). Older age was not correlated with Physical Well-being of the Chest (β=-0.03 [-0.08, 0.02], p=0.2) and Sexual Well-being (β=-0.04 [-0.12, 0.02]; p=0.2). Subgroup analyses of ABR and IBR patients demonstrated different complications and PRO profiles. Our analysis of the impact of age on surgical outcomes and PROs suggests that complication rates increase with age and older age is negatively correlated with Satisfaction with Breasts but positively correlated with Psychosocial Well-being. Overall, older patients should be informed about the potential associated risks and anticipated patient reported outcomes.",['Kim M; Ali B; Zhang K; Vingan P; Boe L; Ly CL; Allen RJ; Stern CS; Matros E; Cordeiro PG; Mehrara B; Nelson JA'],2024,"age was studied as a categorical and continuous variable. results included complications and BREAST-Q scores at preoperative, 6-months, and 1-5 years postoperative. age was significantly associated with increased risk of developing mastectomy skin flap/nipple necrosis, infection, and seroma."
A clinical nomogram for predicting occult lymph node metastasis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer≤2 cm.,"Sublobar resection has been shown to be feasible for non-small cell lung cancers less than 2 cm in size based on several prospective studies. However, the prognosis of clinical N0 patients who experience an N-stage upgrade after surgery (known as occult lymph node metastasis) may be worse. The ability of predict occult lymph node metastasis in patients eligible for sublobar resection remains a controversial issue. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer ≤2 cm in diameter and containing a solid component who underwent surgical treatment at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University were retrospectively enrolled, and 1:1 case matching was performed. The risk factors were identified through logistic regression analyses and theoretical criteria, followed by the development of a nomogram that was evaluated using 200 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation. After case matching, 130 pairs of patients were selected for modelling. According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the carcinoembryonic antigen level, consolidation tumour ratio, mean computed tomography number and tumour margin were included in the nomogram. The cross-validated average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was found to be 0.86. Furthermore, calibration curve and decision curve analyses demonstrated the excellent predictive accuracy and clinical utility of the nomogram respectively. By utilizing accessible characteristics, we developed a nomogram that predicts the probability of occult lymph node metastasis in patients with NSCLC ≤2 cm with a solid component. Risk stratification with this nomogram could aid in surgical method decision-making.",['Ai J; Gao H; Shi G; Lan Y; Hu S; Wang Z; Liu L; Wei Y'],2024,sublobar resection is feasible for non-small cell lung cancers less than 2 cm in size. the prognosis of clinical N0 patients who experience an N-stage upgrade after surgery may be worse. the ability of predict occult lymph node metastasis in patients eligible for sublobar resection remains a controversial issue.
An E115A missense variant in CERS2 is associated with increased sleeping energy expenditure and hepatic insulin resistance in American Indians.,"Genetic determinants of inter-individual differences in energy expenditure (EE) are largely unknown. Sphingolipids, such as ceramides, have been implicated in the regulation of human EE via mitochondrial uncoupling. In this study, we investigated whether genetic variants within enzymes involved in sphingolipid synthesis and degradation affect EE and insulin-related traits in a cohort of American Indians informative for 24-hour EE and glucose disposal rates during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Association analysis of 10,084 genetic variants within 28 genes involved in sphingolipid pathways identified a missense variant (rs267738, A>C, E115A) in exon 4 of CERS2 that was associated with higher sleeping EE (+116 kcal/day) and increased rates of endogenous glucose production during basal (+5%) and insulin-stimulated (+43%) conditions, both indicators of hepatic insulin resistance. The rs267738 variant did not affect ceramide synthesis in HepG2 cells but resulted in a 30% decrease in basal mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the CERS2 rs267738 missense variant may influence hepatic glucose production and post-absorptive sleeping metabolic rate.",['Heinitz S; Traurig M; Krakoff J; Rabe P; Stäubert C; Kobes S; Hanson RL; Stumvoll M; Blüher M; Bogardus C; Baier L; Piaggi P'],2024,genetic determinants of inter-individual differences in energy expenditure are unknown. ceramides have been implicated in the regulation of human EE via mitochondrial uncoupling. a cohort of american Indians informative for 24-hour EE and glucose disposal rates during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.
ITGB4 is a prognostic biomarker and correlated with lung adenocarcinoma brain metastasis.,"The aim of this study is to explore the prognostic value and immune signature of ITGB4 expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) brain metastasis. We comprehensively screened genes associated with LUAD brain metastasis by integrating datasets from the GEO database and TMT-based quantitative proteomics profiles. Univariable survival and Multivariate Cox analysis was used to compare several clinical characteristics with survival, and a risk model was constructed. The biological functions were explored via GO and KEGG analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the TCGA dataset. In addition, we use TIMER to explore the collection of ITGB4 Expression and Immune Infiltration Level in LUAD. The ability of ITGB4 to regulate tumor metastasis was further assessed by migration, invasion assay and Western-blot in H1975-BrM4 cells. We found that ITGB4 was the only gene with high clinical diagnostic and prognostic value in LUAD. Enrichment analysis indicated that ITGB4 is associated with brain metastasis, infiltration of immune cells, and the response to immunotherapy. ITGB4 expression can effectively predict the outcomes of patients with LUAD who are receiving anti-PD-1 therapy. ITGB4 knockdown inhibited the invasion, migration of H1975-BrM4 brain metastasis cells, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) abilities. The heightened expression of ITGB4 protein was shown to promote EMT and enhance the metastatic potential. ITGB4 promotes the progression in H1975-BrM4 cells via MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that the expression of ITGB4 is linked to the occurrence of brain metastasis and infiltration of immune cells, suggesting that ITGB4 might be a clinical treatment target for LUAD.",['Zhang J; Li L; Luo W; Ma S; Zhao Y'],2024,a study screened genes associated with LUAD brain metastasis. it analyzed genes associated with LUAD brain metastasis. the gene set enrichment analysis was performed using TIMER.
Opioid metabolism and drug-drug interaction in cancer.,"Concomitant use of multiple drugs in most patients with cancer may result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs), potentially causing serious adverse effects. These patients often experience unrelieved cancer-related pain (CRP) during and after cancer treatment, which can lead to a reduced quality of life. Opioids can be used as part of a multimodal pain management strategy when non-opioid analgesics are not providing adequate pain relief, not tolerated, or are contraindicated. However, due to their narrow therapeutic window, opioids are more susceptible to adverse events when a DDI occurs. Clinically relevant DDIs with opioids are usually pharmacokinetic, mainly occurring via metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP). This article aims to provide an overview of potential DDIs with opioids often used in the treatment of moderate-to-severe CRP and commonly used anticancer drugs such as chemotherapeutics, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), or biologics. A DDI-checker tool was used to contextualize the tool-informed DDI assessment outcomes with clinical implications and practice. The findings were compared to observations from a literature search conducted in Embase and PubMed to identify clinical evidence for these potential DDIs. The limited results mainly included case studies and retrospective reviews. Some potential DDIs on the DDI-checker were aligned with literature findings, while others were contradictory. In conclusion, while DDI-checkers are useful tools in identifying potential DDIs, it is necessary to incorporate literature verification and comprehensive clinical assessment of the patient before implementing tool-informed decisions in clinical practice.",['Aapro M; Fogli S; Morlion B; Danesi R'],2024,"DDIs with opioids are usually pharmacokinetic, mainly occurring via metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP).

The Efficacy and Safety of Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors in Real-World Clinical Practice: Potential Cautionary Use in Elderly Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown safe and therapeutic efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCT) to reduce adverse cardiorenal events in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 intervention in patients with T2D in a real-world clinical practice to confirm the validity of the RCT results. As a retrospective study, we evaluated medical records from 596 patients with T2D treated with SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) in addition to their prior drug regimen to improve glucose control between 2015 and 2019 in the Endocrinology Department at Chungbuk National University Hospital. No control arm was evaluated to compare the effects of adding SGLT inhibitors to the pre-existing regimen. The primary objective was the measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from each individual patient over a 36-month period at 6-month intervals. The secondary parameters were the measurement of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight (Bwt) changes, as well as the monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and determining the reasons for drug discontinuation. HbA1c levels were reduced at each of the time points throughout the 36-month period and were significantly reduced by 12.5% (P < 0.01) from time 0 (8.8 ± 1.3%) to 36 months (7.7 ± 1.0%). FPG levels [from basal (180 ± 60 mg/dL) to 36 months (138 ± 38 mg/dL)] and Bwt [from basal (74 ± 15 kg) to 36 months (72 ± 15 kg)] were also significantly reduced (P < 0.01) for both measurements in the SGLT2 inhibitor add-on group. Similar to HbA1c profile, the FPG and Bwt were measured at a consistently lower level at 6 months until the end of the study. The most common AEs were hypoglycemia (n = 57), genitourinary infection (GUI) (n = 31), and polyuria (n = 28). In the elderly population (≥ 75 years old), AEs (31%) were generally more prevalent (P < 0.001) than those (21%) in the adult (< 75 years old) patients. Over the study period, 211 (35%) patients either dropped or completely discontinued the use of the SGLT2 inhibitor, and the elderly patients tended to have a higher discontinuation rate (52%; P = 0.005) than the adults (33%). In this study, we demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors are an effective and durable hypoglycemic agent to control blood glucose levels with reduced maintenance of Bwt, but their use in the elderly (≥ 75 years old) patients with T2D may warrant some additional caution due to increased probability of AEs and discontinuation of drug use.",['Lee DH; Oh JH; Jeon HJ; Oh TK'],2024,saturday's trial was conducted in a real-world clinical practice. a retrospective study examined the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 intervention in patients with T2D. no control arm was evaluated to compare effects of adding SGLT inhibitors to the pre-existing regimen.
Association between plasma long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids concentrations and cognitive function: findings from NHANES III.,"With increased life expectancy, cognitive decline has emerged as a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. This study aimed to examine the correlation between concentrations of Plasma long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) and cognitive performance in elderly Americans. Data were analyzed from older adults enrolled in two NHANES cycles. Participants completed four cognitive assessments, including the Immediate Recall Test (IRT), Delayed Recall Test (DRT), Animal Fluency Test (AFT), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Linear regression and restricted cubic spline modeling examined associations between plasma LCPUFAs levels and cognitive test outcomes. The cohort included 610 adults aged 69 years on average, 300 (49.2%) males and 310 (50.8%) females. The median LCPUFAs concentration was 309.4 μmol/L, with an interquartile range of 244.7-418.9 μmol/L. In unadjusted and adjusted generalized linear regression model analyses, circulating LCPUFAs exhibited significant positive correlations with DRT performance. No relationships were detected among those with chronic conditions (chronic heart failure, stroke, diabetes). A significant association between LCPUFAs levels and DRT scores was evident in males but not females. Plasma LCPUFAs concentrations were significantly associated with DRT performance in males free of chronic illnesses, including heart failure, stroke, and diabetes.",['Li X; Huang Z; Tian Y; Chen X; Wu H; Wang T'],2024,"study aims to examine the correlation between plasma LCPUFAs levels and cognitive test outcomes in elderly Americans. participants completed four cognitive assessments, including the Immediate Recall Test (IRT), Delayed Recall Test (DRT), Animal Fluency Test (AFT) and Digit Symbol Substitution test (DSST)."
Suicide Risk Screening for Head and Neck Cancer Patients: An Implementation Study.," There is limited research on suicide risk screening (SRS) among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, a population at increased risk for suicide. To address this gap, this single-site mixed methods study assessed oncology professionals' perspectives about the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of an electronic SRS program that was implemented as a part of routine care for HNC patients. Staff who assisted with SRS implementation completed (e.g., nurses, medical assistants, advanced practice providers, physicians, social workers) a one-time survey (<i>N</i> = 29) and interview (<i>N</i> = 25). Quantitative outcomes were assessed using previously validated feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness measures. Additional qualitative data were collected to provide context for interpreting the scores.  Nurses and medical assistants, who were directly responsible for implementing SRS, reported low feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness, compared with other team members (e.g., physicians, social workers, advanced practice providers). Team members identified potential improvements needed to optimize SRS, such as hiring additional staff, improving staff training, providing different modalities for screening completion among individuals with disabilities, and revising the patient-reported outcomes to improve suicide risk prediction.  Staff perspectives about implementing SRS as a part of routine cancer care for HNC patients varied widely. Before screening can be implemented on a larger scale for HNC and other cancer patients, additional implementation strategies may be needed that optimize workflow and reduce staff burden, such as staff training, multiple modalities for completion, and refined tools for identifying which patients are at greatest risk for suicide.",['Kansara B; Basta A; Mikhael M; Perkins R; Reisman P; Hallanger-Johnson J; Rollison DE; Nguyen OT; Powell S; Gilbert SM; Turner K'],2024,there is limited research on suicide risk screening among head and neck cancer patients. there is limited research on suicide risk screening among patients. staff who assisted with SRS implementation completed a one-time survey.
Iberdomide increases innate and adaptive immune cell subsets in the bone marrow of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.,"Iberdomide is a potent cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD agent) with promising efficacy and safety as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Using a custom mass cytometry panel designed for large-scale immunophenotyping of the bone marrow tumor microenvironment (TME), we demonstrate significant increases of effector T and natural killer (NK) cells in a cohort of 93 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with iberdomide, correlating findings to disease characteristics, prior therapy, and a peripheral blood immune phenotype. Notably, changes are dose dependent, associated with objective response, and independent of prior refractoriness to MM therapies. This suggests that iberdomide broadly induces innate and adaptive immune activation in the TME, contributing to its antitumor efficacy. Our approach establishes a strategy to study treatment-induced changes in the TME of patients with MM and, more broadly, patients with cancer and establishes rational combination strategies for iberdomide with immune-enhancing therapies to treat MM.",['Van Oekelen O; Amatangelo M; Guo M; Upadhyaya B; Cribbs AP; Kelly G; Patel M; Kim-Schulze S; Flynt E; Lagana A; Gooding S; Merad M; Jagganath S; Pierceall WE; Oppermann U; Thakurta A; Parekh S'],2024,iberdomide is a potent cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD agent) with promising efficacy and safety as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). a custom mass cytometry panel designed for large-scale immunophenotyping of the bone marrow tumor microenvironment (TME) showed significant increases of effector T and natural killer cells
Procedural and cardiovascular outcomes of geriatric vs non-geriatric patients undergoing permanent pacemaker implantation - a nationwide cohort analysis.,"Permanent pacemaker implantation is increasing exponentially to treat atrio-ventricular block and symptomatic bradyarrhythmia. Despite being a minor surgery, immediate complications such as pocket infection, pocket hematoma, pneumothorax, hemopericardium, and lead displacement do occur. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried from 2016 to 2018 to identify patients with pacemakers using ICD-10 procedure code. The Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. The sample size consisted of 443,460 patients with a pacemaker, 26% were <70 years (male 57%, mean age of (60.6±9.7) yr, Caucasian 70%) and 74% were ≥70 years (male 50%, mean age of (81.4±5.9) yr, Caucasian 79%). Upon comparison of rates in the young vs elderly: mortality (1.6% vs 1.5%; P<0.01), obesity (26% vs 13%; P<0.001), coronary artery disease (40% vs 49%; P<0.001), HTN (74% vs 87%; P<0.01), anemia (4% vs 5%; P<0.01), atrial fibrillation (34% vs 49%; P<0.01), peripheral artery disease (1.7% vs 3%; P<0.01), CHF (31% vs 39%; P<0.001), diabetes (31% vs 27.4%; P<0.01), vascular complications (1.1% vs 1.2%; P<0.01), pocket hematoma (0.5% vs 0.8%; P<0.01), AKI (16% vs 21%; P<0.01), hemopericardium (0.1% vs 0.1%; P = 0.1), hemothorax (0.3% vs 0.2%; P<0.01), cardiac tamponade (0.4% vs 0.5%; P<0.01), pericardiocentesis (0.4% vs 0.4%; P<0.01), cardiogenic shock (4% vs 2.3%; P<0.01), respiratory complications (1.9% vs 0.9%; P<0.01), mechanical ventilation (5.1% vs 2.9%; P<0.01); post-op bleed (0.5% vs 0.3%; P<0.01), need for transfusion (4.8% vs 3.8%; P<0.01), severe sepsis (0.6% vs 0.5%; P<0.01 ), septic shock (2% vs 1%; P<0.01), bacteraemia (0.8% vs 0.4%; P<0.01), lead dislodgement (1.4% vs 1.1%; P<0.01).

Cardiovascular outcomes in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia on lipoprotein apheresis initiated during childhood: long-term follow-up of an international cohort from two registries.,"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disease characterised by extremely high plasma LDL cholesterol from birth, causing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at a young age. Lipoprotein apheresis in combination with lipid-lowering drugs effectively reduce LDL cholesterol, but long-term health outcomes of such treatment are unknown. We aimed to investigate the long-term cardiovascular outcomes associated with lipoprotein apheresis initiated in childhood or adolescence. In this cohort study, data were drawn from the HoFH International Clinical Collaboration (HICC) and the international registry for Children with Homozygous Hypercholesterolemia on Lipoprotein Apheresis (CHAIN). An overall cohort included patients diagnosed with HoFH aged 0-18 years who were alive and in follow-up between Jan 1, 2010, and Nov 8, 2021, and whose high plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations made them eligible for lipoprotein apheresis. To compare cardiovascular outcomes, patients who initiated lipoprotein apheresis in childhood (lipoprotein apheresis group) and patients who only received lipid-lowering drugs (pharmacotherapy-only group) were matched by sex and untreated plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, peripheral artery disease, carotid endarterectomy, angina pectoris, and supra-aortic or aortic stenosis (collectively referred to as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), for which survival analyses were performed in the matched cohort. Cox regression analyses were used to compare disease-free survival between cohorts and to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis, untreated plasma LDL cholesterol concentration, and number of lipid-lowering therapies other than lipoprotein apheresis. The overall cohort included 404 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 6·0 years (IQR 3·0-9·5) and median untreated plasma LDL cholesterol of 17·8 mmol/L (14·7-20·8). The matched cohorts included 250 patients (125 patients per group), with a median untreated LDL cholesterol of 17·2 mmol/L (14·8-19·7). Mean reduction in plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations between baseline and final follow-up was greater in the lipoprotein apheresis group (-55% [95% CI -60 to -51] vs -31% [-36 to -25]; p<0·0001). Patients in the lipoprotein apheresis group had longer atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-free survival (adjusted HR 0·52 [95% CI 0·32-0·85]) and longer cardiovascular death-free survival (0·0301 [0·0021-0·4295]). Cardiovascular death was more common in the pharmacotherapy-only group than in the lipoprotein apheresis group (ten [8%] vs one [1%]; p=0·010), whereas median age at coronary artery bypass grafting was lower in the lipoprotein apheresis group than in the pharmacotherapy-only group (15·0 years [IQR 12·0-24·0] vs 30·5 years [19·0-33·8]; p=0·037). Among patients with HoFH, lipoprotein apheresis initiated during childhood and adolescence is associated with reduced long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and death, and clear benefits of early initiation of high-frequency treatment on reducing plasma cholesterol were found. Consensus recommendations are now needed to guide more widespread and timely use of lipoprotein apheresis for children with HoFH, and research is required to further optimise treatment and ensure benefits of early and aggressive treatment delivery are balanced against effects on quality of life.

The best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method as a tool to estimate the lifetime risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in high-risk individuals with no known pathogenic germline variants.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western world. The number of diagnosed cases and the mortality rate are almost equal as the majority of patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis. Between 4 and 10% of pancreatic cancer cases have an apparent hereditary background, known as hereditary pancreatic cancer (HPC) and familial pancreatic cancer (FPC), when the genetic basis is unknown. Surveillance of high-risk individuals (HRI) from these families by imaging aims to detect PDAC at an early stage to improve prognosis. However, the genetic basis is unknown in the majority of HRIs, with only around 10-13% of families carrying known pathogenic germline mutations. The aim of this study was to assess an individual's genetic cancer risk based on sex and personal and family history of cancer. The Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology was used to estimate an individual's predicted risk of developing cancer during their lifetime. The model uses different demographic factors in order to estimate heritability. A reliable estimation of heritability for pancreatic cancer of 0.27 on the liability scale, and 0.07 at the observed data scale as obtained, which is different from zero, indicating a polygenic inheritance pattern of PDAC. BLUP was able to correctly discriminate PDAC cases from healthy individuals and those with other cancer types. Thus, providing an additional tool to assess PDAC risk HRI with an assumed genetic predisposition in the absence of known pathogenic germline mutations.",['Sanchez MEC; de Paredes AGG; Rodríguez M; Barreto E; López JV; Fuentes R; Beltrán MM; Sanjuanbenito A; Lobo E; Caminoa A; Ruz-Caracuel I; Durán SL; Olcina JRF; Blázquez J; Sequeros EV; Carrato A; Ávila JCM; Earl J'],2024,between 4 and 10% of pancreatic cancer cases have an apparent hereditary background. the genetic basis is unknown in the majority of HRIs. only around 10-13% of families carrying known pathogenic germline mutations carry known pathogenic germline mutations.
The mechanism of action of Botrychium (Thunb.) Sw. for prevention of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on 1H-NMR-based metabolomics.,"This study aimed to reveal the anti-fibrotic effects of Botrychium ternatum (Thunb.) Sw. (BT) against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to preliminarily analyze its potential mechanism on bleomycin-induced IPF rats. The inhibition of fibrosis progression in vivo was assessed by histopathology combined with biochemical indicators. In addition, the metabolic regulatory mechanism was investigated using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Firstly, biochemical analysis revealed that BT notably suppressed the expression of hydroxyproline and transforming growth factor-β1 in the pulmonary tissue. Secondly, Masson's trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosin showed that BT substantially improved the structure of the damaged lung and significantly inhibited the proliferation of collagen fibers and the deposition of extracellular matrix. Finally, serum metabolomic analysis suggested that BT may exert anti-fibrotic effects by synergistically regulating tyrosine metabolism; phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis; and synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies. Our study not only clarifies the potential anti-fibrotic mechanism of BT against IPF at the metabolic level but also provides a theoretical basis for developing BT as an effective anti-fibrotic agent.",['Lou Y; Zou X; Pan Z; Huang Z; Zheng S; Zheng X; Yang X; Bao M; Zhang Y; Gu J; Zhang Y'],2024,BT inhibited the expression of hydroxyproline and transforming growth factor-1 in the pulmonary tissue. trichrome staining and hematoxylin and eosin showed that BT substantially improved the structure of the damaged lung.
Implementing a closed system drug transfer device to enable nurses to prepare monoclonal antibody treatment.,"Efforts to increase capacity for oncology treatment in the author's Chemotherapy Day Unit, while allowing staff to treat more patients and offer more flexibility to patients, increased strain on the Aseptic Pharmacy at the author's Trust. Therefore, the possibility of nurse-led drug preparation was explored. Nurse-led monoclonal antibody (MAb) preparation was piloted to investigate whether a reduction in reliance on Aseptic Pharmacy could co-exist with maintaining optimal treatment capacity. The effectiveness of a closed system transfer device (CSTD) to protect nurses against drug exposure was also explored. A risk assessment for MAbs considered for nurse-led preparation was created, alongside a procedure for the safe handling of systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) with the use of a CSTD. The pilot resulted in an 89% reduction in the time patients had to wait for MAbs to be prepared.

"Efficacy and safety of sympathetic mapping and ablation of renal nerves for the treatment of hypertension (SMART): 6-month follow-up of a randomised, controlled trial.","Previous trials of renal denervation (RDN) have been designed to investigate reduction of blood pressure (BP) as the primary efficacy endpoint using non-selective RDN without intraoperatively verified RDN success. It is an unmet clinical need to map renal nerves, selectively denervate renal sympathetic nerves, provide readouts for the interventionalists and avoid futile RDN. We aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of renal nerve mapping/selective renal denervation (msRDN) in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) and determine whether antihypertensive drug burden is reduced while office systolic BP (OSBP) is controlled to target level (＜140 mmHg). We conducted a randomized, prospective, multicenter, single-blinded, sham-controlled trial. The study combined two efficacy endpoints at 6 months as primary outcomes: The control rate of patients with OSBP ＜140 mmHg (non-inferior outcome) and change in the composite index of antihypertensive drugs (Drug Index) in the treatment versus Sham group (superior outcome). This design avoids confounding from excess drug-taking in the Sham group. Antihypertensive drug burden was assessed by a composite index constructed as: Class N (number of classes of antihypertensive drugs) × (sum of doses). 15 hospitals in China participated in the study and 220 patients were enrolled in a 1:1 ratio (msRDN vs Sham). The key inclusion criteria included: age (18-65 years old), history of essential HTN (at least 6 months), heart rate (≥70 bpm), OSBP (≥150 mmHg and ≤180 mmHg), ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM, 24-h SBP ≥130 mmHg or daytime SBP ≥135 mmHg or nighttime SBP ≥120 mmHg), renal artery stenosis (＜50%) and renal function (eGFR ＞45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The catheter with both stimulation and ablation functions was inserted in the distal renal main artery. The RDN site (hot spot) was selected if SBP increased (≥5 mmHg) by intra-renal artery (RA) electrical stimulation; an adequate RDN was confirmed by repeated electronic stimulation if no increase in BP otherwise, a 2nd ablation was performed at the same site. At sites where there was decreased SBP (≥5 mmHg, cold spot) or no BP response (neutral spot) to stimulation, no ablation was performed. The mapping, ablation and confirmation procedure was repeated until the entire renal main artery had been tested then either treated or avoided. After msRDN, patients had to follow a predefined, vigorous drug titration regimen in order to achieve target OSBP (＜140 mmHg). Drug adherence was monitored by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis using urine. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02761811) and 5-year follow-up is ongoing. Between July 8, 2016 and February 23, 2022, 611 patients were consented, 220 patients were enrolled in the study who received standardized antihypertensive drug treatments (at least two drugs) for at least 28 days, presented OSBP ≥150 mmHg and ≤180 mmHg and met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. In left RA and right RA, mapped sites were 8.2 (3.0) and 8.0 (2.7), hot/ablated sites were 3.7 (1.4) and 4.0 (1.6), cold spots were 2.4 (2.6) and 2.0 (2.2), neutral spots were 2.0 (2.1) and 2.0 (2.1), respectively. Hot, cold and neutral spots was 48.0%, 27.5% and 24.4% of total mapped sites, respectively. At 6 M, the Control Rate of OSBP was comparable between msRDN and Sham group (95.4% vs 92.8%, p = 0.429), achieved non-inferiority margin -10% (2.69%; 95% CI -4.11%, 9.83%, p ＜ 0.001 for non-inferiority); the change in Drug Index was significantly lower in msRDN group compared to Sham group (4.37 (6.65) vs 7.61 (10.31), p = 0.010) and superior to Sham group (-3.25; 95% CI -5.56, -0.94, p = 0.003), indicating msRDN patients need significantly fewer drugs to control OSBP ＜140 mmHg. 24-hour ambulatory SBP decreased from 146.8 (13.9) mmHg by 10.8 (14.1) mmHg, and from 149.8 (12.8) mmHg by 10.0 (14.0) mmHg in msRDN and Sham groups, respectively (p < 0.001 from Baseline; p > 0.05 between groups). Safety profiles were comparable between msRDN and Sham groups, demonstrating the safety and efficacy of renal mapping/selective RDN to treat uncontrolled HTN. The msRDN therapy achieved the goals of reducing the drug burden of HTN patients and controlling OSBP <140 mmHg, with only approximately four targeted ablations per renal main artery, much lower than in previous trials.

Bone metabolism in diabetes: a clinician's guide to understanding the bone-glucose interplay.,"Skeletal fragility is an increasingly recognised, but poorly understood, complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Fracture risk varies according to skeletal site and diabetes-related characteristics. Post-fracture outcomes, including mortality risk, are worse in those with diabetes, placing these people at significant risk. Each fracture therefore represents a sentinel event that warrants targeted management. However, diabetes is a very heterogeneous condition with complex interactions between multiple co-existing, and highly correlated, factors that preclude a clear assessment of the independent clinical markers and pathophysiological drivers for diabetic osteopathy. Additionally, fracture risk calculators and routinely used clinical bone measurements generally underestimate fracture risk in people with diabetes. In the absence of dedicated prospective studies including detailed bone and metabolic characteristics, optimal management centres around selecting treatments that minimise skeletal and metabolic harm. This review summarises the clinical landscape of diabetic osteopathy and outlines the interplay between metabolic and skeletal health. The underlying pathophysiology of skeletal fragility in diabetes and a rationale for considering a diabetes-based paradigm in assessing and managing diabetic bone disease will be discussed.",['Sheu A; White CP; Center JR'],2024,fracture risk calculators and bone measurements underestimate fracture risk in diabetes. skeletal fragility is a complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Extracellular vesicles promote migration despite BRAF inhibitor treatment in malignant melanoma cells.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) constitute a vital component of intercellular communication, exerting significant influence on metastasis formation and drug resistance mechanisms. Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancers, because of its high metastatic potential and often acquired resistance to oncotherapies. The prevalence of BRAF mutations in MM underscores the importance of BRAF-targeted therapies, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib. This study aimed to elucidate the involvement of EVs in MM progression and ascertain whether EV-mediated metastasis promotion persists during single agent BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib), or MEK (trametinib) and combined BRAF/MEK (dabrafenib/trametinib) inhibition.Using five pairs of syngeneic melanoma cell lines, we assessed the impact of EVs - isolated from their respective supernatants - on melanoma cell proliferation and migration. Cell viability and spheroid growth assays were employed to evaluate proliferation, while migration was analyzed through mean squared displacement (MSD) and total traveled distance (TTD) measurements derived from video microscopy and single-cell tracking.Our results indicate that while EV treatments had remarkable promoting effect on cell migration, they exerted only a modest effect on cell proliferation and spheroid growth. Notably, EVs demonstrated the ability to mitigate the inhibitory effects of BRAF inhibitors, albeit they were ineffective against a MEK inhibitor and the combination of BRAF/MEK inhibitors. In summary, our findings contribute to the understanding of the intricate role played by EVs in tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance in MM.",['Németh A; Bányai GL; Dobos NK; Kós T; Gaál A; Varga Z; Buzás EI; Khamari D; Dank M; Takács I; Szász AM; Garay T'],2024,melanoma (MM) is one of the deadliest forms of skin cancers. prevalence of BRAF mutations in MM underscores the importance of BRAF-targeted therapies.

Molecular mechanism of Danxiong Tongmai Granules in treatment of coronary heart disease.,"Danxiong Tongmai Granules (DXTMG) are widely utilized in treating coronary heart disease (CHD) in China. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DXTMG on CHD by employing a network pharmacology approach, complemented with experimental validation. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds and targets were identified via searches in the BATMAN-TCM database, and the GeneCards database was used to obtain the main target genes involved in CHD. We combined disease targets with the drug targets to identify common targets. The ""TCM-compound-target"" network was plotted using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database from which core targets were obtained. Gene ontology (GO) function analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed for common drug-disease targets using R Version 4.0.4 (64 bit) software. Molecular docking of core protein-small molecule ligand interaction was modeled using AutoDock software. A molecular dynamics simulation was conducted on the optimal protein-small molecule complex identified through molecular docking, using Amber18 software. The rat model for myocardial ischemia was established through pre-gavage administration of DXTMG, followed by dorsal hypodermic injection of isoprenaline. Myocardial tissues from the rats were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Relevant targets were validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry. 162 potential targets of DXTMG involved in CHD were identified. These included INS, ALB, IL-6 and TNF according to PPI network studies. GO enrichment analysis identified a total of 3365 GO pathways, including 3049 biological process pathways (BP) concerned with the heart and circulatory system; 109 cellular component (CC) pathways, including cation channels and membrane rafts and 207 molecular function (MF) pathways related to receptor ligands and activators. KEGG analysis revealed a total of 137 pathways (<i>P</i> < 0.05), including those related to AGE-RAGE signaling associated with diabetic complications, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis. The results of molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the robust binding affinity between the compounds and target proteins. Animal experiment findings indicated that, compared with the model group, the DXTMG group effectively ameliorated inflammation and fibrosis in rat myocardial tissues, reduced LDH, cTn-I, and MDA levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01), elevated SOD and GSH-PX levels (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and reduced the percentage of positive area for IL-6 and TNF-α (<i>P</i> < 0.05). This study preliminarily suggests that DXTMG can modulate oxidative stress, inflammation response, and cardiomyocyte regulation, thereby mitigating the onset and progression of CHD.",['Ye J; Yang R; Li L; Zhong S; Jiang R; Hu Z'],2024,"a network pharmacology approach was used to identify common target genes. the ""TCM-compound-target"" network was plotted using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. a protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database."
Mesenchymal-like immune-altered is the fourth robust triple-negative breast cancer molecular subtype.,"Robust molecular subtyping of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a prerequisite for the success of precision medicine. Today, there is a clear consensus on three TNBC molecular subtypes: luminal androgen receptor (LAR), basal-like immune-activated (BLIA), and basal-like immune-suppressed (BLIS). However, the debate about the robustness of other subtypes is still open. An unprecedented number (n = 1942) of TNBC patient data was collected. Microarray- and RNAseq-based cohorts were independently investigated. Unsupervised analyses were conducted using k-means consensus clustering. Clusters of patients were then functionally annotated using different approaches. Prediction of response to chemotherapy and targeted therapies, immune checkpoint blockade, and radiotherapy were also screened for each TNBC subtype. Four TNBC subtypes were identified in the cohort: LAR (19.36%); mesenchymal stem-like (MSL/MES) (17.35%); BLIA (31.06%); and BLIS (32.23%). Regarding the MSL/MES subtype, we suggest renaming it to mesenchymal-like immune-altered (MLIA) to emphasize its specific histological background and nature of immune response. Treatment response prediction results show, among other things, that despite immune activation, immune checkpoint blockade is probably less or completely ineffective in MLIA, possibly caused by mesenchymal background and/or an enrichment in dysfunctional cytotoxic T lymphocytes. TNBC subtyping results were included in the bc-GenExMiner v5.0 webtool ( http://bcgenex.ico.unicancer.fr ). The mesenchymal TNBC subtype is characterized by an exhausted and altered immune response, and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Consensus for molecular classification of TNBC subtyping and prediction of cancer treatment responses helps usher in the era of precision medicine for TNBC patients.",['Jézéquel P; Lasla H; Gouraud W; Basseville A; Michel B; Frenel JS; Juin PP; Ben Azzouz F; Campone M'],2024,a clear consensus on three TNBC molecular subtypes is still open. the debate about the robustness of other subtypes is still open.
CDK12-inactivation-induced MYC signaling causes dependency on the splicing kinase SRPK1.,"Inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) characterizes an aggressive sub-group of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Hyper-activation of MYC transcription factor is sufficient to confer the CRPC phenotype. Here, we show that loss of CDK12 promotes MYC activity, which renders the cells dependent on the otherwise non-essential splicing regulatory kinase SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1). High MYC expression is associated with increased levels of SRPK1 in patient samples, and overexpression of MYC sensitizes prostate cancer cells to SRPK1 inhibition using pharmacological and genetic strategies. We show that Endovion (SCO-101), a compound currently in clinical trials against pancreatic cancer, phenocopies the effects of the well-characterized SRPK1 inhibitor SRPIN340 on nascent transcription. This is the first study to show that Endovion is an SRPK1 inhibitor. Inhibition of SRPK1 with either of the compounds promotes transcription elongation, and transcriptionally activates the unfolded protein response. In brief, here we discover that CDK12 inactivation promotes MYC signaling in an SRPK1-dependent manner, and show that the clinical grade compound Endovion selectively targets the cells with CDK12 inactivation.",['Liang J; Gondane A; Itkonen HM'],2024,"cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) characterizes an aggressive sub-group of castration-resistant prostate cancer. loss of CDK12 promotes MYC activity, which renders cells dependent on the otherwise non-essential splicing regulatory kinase SRSF protein kinase 1 (SRPK1). this is the first study to show that Endovion is an SRPK1 inhibitor."
T cells in obesity-associated inflammation: The devil is in the details.,"Obesity presents a significant health challenge, affecting 41% of adults and 19.7% of children in the United States. One of the associated health challenges of obesity is chronic low-grade inflammation. In both mice and humans, T cells in circulation and in the adipose tissue play a pivotal role in obesity-associated inflammation. Changes in the numbers and frequency of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Th subsets and their contribution to inflammation through cytokine production indicate declining metabolic health, that is, insulin resistance and T2D. While some Th subset alterations are consistent between mice and humans with obesity, some changes mainly characterize male mice, whereas female mice often resist obesity and inflammation. However, protection from obesity and inflammation is not observed in human females, who can develop obesity-related T-cell inflammation akin to males. The decline in female sex hormones after menopause is also implicated in promoting obesity and inflammation. Age is a second underappreciated factor for defining and regulating obesity-associated inflammation toward translating basic science findings to the clinic. Weight loss in mice and humans, in parallel with these other factors, does not resolve obesity-associated inflammation. Instead, inflammation persists amid modest changes in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies, highlighting the need for further research into resolving changes in T-cell function after weight loss. How lingering inflammation after weight loss affecting the common struggle to maintain lower weight is unknown. Semaglutide, a newly popular pharmaceutical used for treating T2D and reversing obesity, holds promise for alleviating obesity-associated health complications, yet its impact on T-cell-mediated inflammation remains unexplored. Further work in this area could significantly contribute to the scientific understanding of the impacts of weight loss and sex/hormones in obesity and obesity-associated metabolic decline.",['Valentine Y; Nikolajczyk BS'],2024,"obesity is a health challenge, affecting 41% of adults and 19.7% of children in the united states. inflammation persists amid modest changes in CD4sup>+/sup> T cell frequencies."

Rapid Tumor DNA Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid Accelerates Treatment of Central Nervous System Lymphoma.,"Delays and risks associated with neurosurgical biopsies preclude timely diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and other CNS neoplasms. We prospectively integrated targeted rapid genotyping of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the evaluation of 70 patients with CNS lesions of unknown etiology. Participants underwent genotyping of CSF-derived DNA using a qPCR-based approach for parallel detection of single-nucleotide variants in the MYD88, TERT promoter, IDH1, IDH2, BRAF and H3F3A genes within 80 minutes of sample acquisition. Canonical mutations were detected in 42% of patients with neoplasms, including cases of primary and secondary CNS lymphoma, glioblastoma, IDH-mutant brainstem glioma and H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. Genotyping results eliminated the need for surgical biopsies in 7/33 (21.2%) cases of newly diagnosed neoplasms, resulting in significantly accelerated initiation of disease-directed treatment (median 3 vs 12 days; p = 0.027). This assay was then implemented in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) environment, with 2-day median turnaround for diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma from 66 patients across 4 clinical sites.

"Charcot Neuro-Osteoarthropathy With Superimposed Osteomyelitis in a Nondiabetic Patient, as a Consequence of Cancer Chemotherapy: A MR-Monitored Case Report.","Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy (CNO) is a manifestation of peripheral neuropathy as a chronic complication of diabetes mellitus but, less frequently, can be associated to other conditions such as alcoholism or neurotoxic therapies. An increasingly emerging cause of CNO is the use of oncological drugs which can cause neuropathic damage. The use of these therapies dramatically increased in recent years. CNO leads to a progressive degeneration of the foot's joints and to bone destruction and resorption which ends in deformities. These alterations in the foot's anatomy determine a high risk of ulceration, infection, and osteomyelitis. The superimposition of osteomyelitis on CNO increases the risk of major amputation, already high in patients suffering either from only CNO or osteomyelitis alone. We report the case of a 61-year old nondiabetic woman affected by CNO as a consequence of antiblastic therapy for breast cancer and the subsequent overlap of osteomyelitis, confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. This case underlines how it is necessary to consider CNO as a possible complication of antiblastic therapy in the view of the severe consequences of missing its diagnosis.",['Giangreco F; Iacopi E; Maltinti M; Aringhieri G; Goretti C; Pieruzzi L; Piaggesi A'],2024,"a 61-year-old nondiabetic woman affected by CNO is diagnosed with cancer. the resulting overlap of osteomyelitis is confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. the case is a complication of diabetes mellitus but less frequently, can be associated to other conditions such as alcoholism or neurotoxic therapies."
"Calcium-sensing Receptor, a Potential Biomarker Revealed by Large-scale Public Databases and Experimental Verification in Metastatic Breast Cancer.","Breast cancer (BC) is a common cancer characterized by a high molecular heterogeneity. Therefore, understanding its biological properties and developing effective treatments for patients with different molecular features is imperative. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been implicated in several regulatory functions in various types of human cancers. However, its underlying pathological mechanism in BC progression remains elusive. We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases to explore the function of CaSR in the metastasis of BC. Gene ontology analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of biological processes and cell signaling pathways revealed that CaSR could be activated or inhibited. Importantly, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to verify the gene expression of the CaSR. Wound healing and transwell assays were conducted to assess the effect of CaSR on the migration of BC cells. We demonstrated that CaSR expression in metastatic BC was higher than that in non-metastatic BC. It is the first time that database information has been used to reveal the biological process and molecular mechanism of CaSR in BC. Moreover, the CaSR expression in normal breast epithelial cells was notably less compared to that in BC cells. The activation of CaSR by Cinacalcet (a CaSR agonist) significantly enhanced the migration of BC cells, whereas NPS-2143 (a CaSR antagonist) treatment dramatically inhibited these effects. Bioinformatics techniques and experiments demonstrated the involvement of CaSR in BC metastasis. Our findings shed new light on the receptor therapy and molecular pathogenesis of BC, and emphasize the crucial function of CaSR, facilitating the metastasis of BC.",['Xie W; Xu H; Cheng Y; Lin X; Zeng J; Sun Y'],2024,"the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) has been implicated in several regulatory functions in various types of human cancers. however, its underlying pathological mechanism in BC progression remains elusive."
Association between gestational cardiovascular health in the first trimester and pregnancy outcomes in the China birth cohort.,"To determine whether gestational cardiovascular health (CVH) during the first trimester is associated with a risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. A multicentre prospective cohort; part of the China birth cohort study. Pregnant women were recruited at 6-13<sup>+6</sup> gestation weeks and followed to delivery to identify pregnancy outcomes. Gestational CVH in the first trimester was assessed using five CVH metrics: body mass index, smoking, blood pressure, glucose, and lipids. Multilevel modified Poisson regression models calculated the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of gestational CVH for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Among 56,852 pregnant women, the mean score for gestational CVH during the first trimester was 9.1. Adjusting for confounding factors, each 1-point decrease in the total gestational CVH score significantly increased the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR = 1.682, 95% CI: 1.624-1.743), gestational diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.405, 95% CI: 1.384-1.426), preterm birth (RR = 1.184, 95% CI: 1.174-1.195), large for gestational age (RR = 1.224, 95% CI: 1.199-1.250), caesarean delivery (RR = 1.073, 95% CI: 1.049-1.097), and low Apgar score (RR = 1.131, 95% CI: 1.003-1.277) significantly increased. Meanwhile, the risk of small for gestational age decreased (SGA; RR = 0.922, 95% CI: 0.898-0.946).

"The associations between dietary flavonoids intake and risk of depressive symptom in diabetic patients: Data from NHANES 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2017-2018.","The increasing incidence of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients contributes to the global burden of disease, but few epidemiological studies have evaluated the relationship between dietary flavonoids intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients in American adults. This study intended to evaluate the associations of dietary flavonoids intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients in American adults. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1993 adults aged ≥20 years old who participated in the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Chi-square test and independent-sample t-test were used to compare subjects' characteristics. Logistic regression model was further used to analyze the relationship between dietary flavonoid intake and depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was used to investigate the non-linear relationship between dietary flavonoid intake and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. The weighted quartile sum (WQS) regression was used to analyze the effect of 29 flavonoids monomers. The results showed that the total flavonoid intake in the third quartile (OR, 0.635; 95 % CI,0.419-0.962; P, 0.032) was significantly associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients compared with the lowest quartile. And there was a U-shaped association between dietary flavonoid intake and risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients. Top contributors of flavonoid monomers were eriodictyol, naringenin, and theaflavin-3'-gallate, accounting for a percentage of 30.83 %, 22.17 %, and 6.92 %, respectively. Moderate (56.07-207.12 mg/day) dietary flavonoid intake was associated with a reduced risk of depressive symptoms in diabetic patients.

"Age-Related Patterns of Symptoms and Risk Factors in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): A Study Based on Cardiology Patients' Records at Rehman Medical Institute, Peshawar.","Introduction Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition characterized by reduced blood flow to the heart and includes various conditions such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate age-related patterns of symptoms and risk factors in ACS patients and to evaluate how diagnostic test results differ among various age groups of ACS patients. Methodology This retrospective study was conducted from May to November of 2023 on patients with acute coronary syndrome admitted to the cardiology ward of Rehman Medical Institute (RMI), Peshawar. The sample size was 137 ACS-diagnosed patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After getting ethical approval from the institutional ethical approval board, data were collected for the entire year of 2022 based on proforma with the variables demographic data, troponin I level, presented symptoms, and associated co-morbidities of the patients. The inclusion criteria were patients of all genders, patients diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), and patients whose records were available in the cardiology department of Rehman Medical Institute.  Results The results show that ACS is more prevalent in the age group of 50-69 years (p=0.037) and is significantly more common in males (p=0.019). Chest pain emerged as the predominant symptom, with a significant association of p=0.029 between chest pain and patients of ACS in the age group 30-49 years. While raised troponin I levels were prevalent across all age groups. Moreover, specific risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and family history of CAD showed the significance of p= 0.04, p=0.006, and p=0.021, respectively, with the age group 50-69 years old.

TyG was computed as Ln [triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL)/2]. The outcome variable was hyperuricemia. The association between TyG and hyperuricemia was examined using weighted multiple logistic regression, subgroup analysis, generalized additive models, smooth fitting curves, and two-piecewise linear regression models. In the regression model adjusting for all confounding variables, the OR (95% CI) for the association between TyG and hyperuricemia was 2.34 (1.70, 3.21). There is a nonlinear and reverse U-shaped association between TyG and hyperuricemia, with a inflection point of 9.69. The OR (95% CI) before the inflection point was 2.64 (2.12, 3.28), and after the inflection point was 0.32 (0.11, 0.98). The interaction in gender, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes analysis was statistically significant. Additional prospective studies are required to corroborate the current findings, which indicate a strong positive connection between TyG and hyperuricemia among adults in the United States.",['Qiu L; Ren Y; Li J; Li M; Li W; Qin L; Ning C; Zhang J; Gao F'],2024,"from 2011 to 2018, a cross-sectional study was carried out using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey. from 2011 to 2018, a cross-sectional study was carried out using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nHANES) this study had 8572 participants in all."
BMI status and weight trajectories across females' reproductive years and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: a prospective cohort study.,"Prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) is a well-established risk factor of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). The associations of long-term and short-term weight trajectories with APOs are less clear. This study aimed to determine the associations of weight trajectories during females' reproductive years, before and between pregnancies, with risk of APOs. We followed 16,241 females (25,386 singleton pregnancies) participating in a prospective cohort, the Nurses' Health Study II. Weight at age 18 y, current weight, and height were assessed at baseline (1989), and weight was updated biennially. Pregnancy history was self-reported in 2009. The primary outcome was a composite of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational diabetes (GDM), preterm birth, and stillbirth. Secondary outcomes were individual APOs. The associations of weight change with APOs were estimated using log-binomial regression, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, reproductive factors, and baseline BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age at first in-study pregnancy was 33.7 (4.1) y. The mean (SD) time from age 18 y to pregnancy, baseline to pregnancy, and between pregnancies was 16.3 (4.0), 6.1 (3.0), and 2.9 (1.6) y, with a corresponding weight change of 6.4 (9.1), 3.1 (5.8), and 2.3 (4.8) kg, respectively. Of the pregnancies, 4628 (18.2%) were complicated by ≥1 APOs. Absolute weight change since age 18 y was most strongly associated with APOs. Compared with females whose weight remained stable (0-2 kg) since age 18, females who gained >2 kg had higher risk of APO (2.1-9.9 kg, relative risk [RR]: 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02, 1.23; 10.0-14.9 kg, RR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.29, 1.60; ≥15 kg, RR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.69, 2.08), primarily driven by HDP and GDM. The associations of per 1 kg weight gain before and between pregnancies with HDP were nearly identical. Weight trajectories prior to and between pregnancies were associated with the risk of APOs, particularly HDP. Longer periods of weight gain, corresponding to greater absolute weight gain, were most strongly associated with higher risk of APOs.",['Arvizu M; Wang S; Mitsunami M; Mínguez-Alarcón L; Gaskins AJ; Rosner B; Rich-Edwards JW; Chavarro JE'],2024,"weight trajectories during females' reproductive years with risk of APOs. we followed 16,241 females (25,386 singleton pregnancies) participating in a prospective cohort, the Nurses' Health Study II."
May the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) play a role in predicting age-related macular degeneration?,"It is known that a healthy and balanced diet plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The aim of this study is to show the possible relationship between the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and AMD. This observational longitudinal study included 50 patients who were diagnosed with AMD and 100 participants as control group in the Ophthalmology Polyclinic of Kırşehir Ahi Evran Training and Research Hospital between December 2022 and February 2023. The PNI scores of the patients were calculated with the formula (10 × albumin (g/L) + (0.005 × total lymphocyte count), using routine hemogram and biochemical assays. One hundred fifty participants were included in the study (average age: 73.7 ± 8.6 years, male: 53.3%). When adjusted for age, sex, and total comorbidity index score via multivariate logistic regression analysis, the association between AMD and PNI scores (OR = 0.3; CI: 0.2-0.4; p = 0.01) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores (OR = 6.8; CI: 2.8-16.6; p = 0.01) was statistically significant.

The Impact of Red Beetroot Products on Glycemic Profiles: A Systematic Review of Human Evidence.,"Low-glycemic diets are crucial, particularly for individuals with diet-related diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Therefore, observing the impact of multiple forms of red beetroot-based products on the glycemic profiles of humans under various health conditions has arguably become significant due to beetroot's high fiber content, antioxidants, inorganic nitrates, etc., which this review aims to summarize. The relevant articles published between 2000 and 2022 were obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect by following the PRISMA-P 2020 statement. This systematic review included 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one non-randomized clinical trial (non-RCT), and one quasi-experimental (QE) study, and they covered different health conditions, e.g., type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, hypertension, etc. The studies produced conflicting results, likely due to differences in the study design, dosage, duration, and population. The risk of bias in most of the RCTs and QE studies included in the review was assessed as low or moderate, and only one non-RCT was assessed as having a high risk of bias. Red beetroot may help maintain the blood sugar levels of humans under different health conditions. However, the existing results on beetroot's potential for glycemic management are unclear due to varied outcomes across studies. Further intervention studies with standardized protocols and diverse participant groups are necessary to assess the role of beetroot products in regulating blood sugar levels before making a definitive judgment.",['Alhalabi B; Joseph A; Kumar D'],2024,"study included 18 randomized controlled trials, one non-RCT and one quasi-experimental study. the study produced conflicting results, likely due to differences in the study design, dosage, duration, and population."
Mechanistic evaluation of myristicin on apoptosis and cell cycle regulation in breast cancer cells.,"The current study was focused on the anticancer activity of myristicin against MCF-7 human breast cancer (BC) cells. BC is the most common and leading malignant disease in women worldwide. Now-a-days, various conventional therapies are used against BC and still represent a chief challenge because those treatments fail to differentiate normal cells from malignant cells, and they have severe side effects also. So, there is a need develop new therapies to decrease BC-related morbidity and mortality. Myristicin, a 1‑allyl‑5‑methoxy‑3, 4‑methylenedioxybenzene, is a main active aromatic compound present in various spices, such as nutmeg, mace, carrot, cinnamon, parsely and some essential oils. Myristicin has a wide range of effects, including antitumor, antioxidative and antimicrobial activity. Nevertheless, the effects of myristicin on human BC cells remain largely unrevealed. The cytotoxicity effect of myristicin on MCF‑7 cells was increased dose dependently detected by (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and Lactate Dehydrogenase assays. Myristicin was found to be significantly inducing the cell apoptosis, as compared to control, using acridine orange/ethidium bromide, Hoechst stain and annexin V. Moreover, it activates cell antimigration, intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and cell cycle arrest in the G<sub>1</sub>/S phase. In addition, myristicin induces the expression of apoptosis and cell cycle genes (Caspases8, Bax, Bid, Bcl2, PARP, p53, and Cdk1) was demonstrated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and apoptosis proteins (c-PARP, Caspase 9, Cytochrome C, PDI) expression was also analyzed with western blot. Overall, we illustrated that myristicin could regulate apoptosis signaling pathways in MCF-7 BC cells.",['Sufina Nazar S; Ayyappan JP'],2024,"myristicin is a main active aromatic compound present in various spices. it activates cell apoptosis, as compared to control."
[The use of medical imaging as a therapeutic patient education tool in radiotherapy : a feasibility study].,"Because of its prevalence and high mortality rate, cancer is a major public health challenge. Radiotherapy is an important treatment option, and makes extensive use of medical imaging. Until now, this type of tool has been reserved to professionals, but it is now opening up to wider use, including by patients themselves for educational purposes. However, this type of usage has been little explored so far. An experimental feasibility study was carried out in the radiotherapy department of the University Hospital of Liège on adult patients with cancer or pulmonary metastases, assigned to two randomized groups. In addition to the usual information given by the radiotherapist, the patients of the experimental group benefited from an intervention consisting in the 3D visualization of their own medical images via the free and open-source computer software «Stone of Orthanc». The study results show a low refuse rate (8.2 %) for the 15 patients recruited. Although non-significant, the experimental group showed a median gain in global perception of knowledge, a decrease in anxiety scores and emotional distress. A significant reduction (p = 0.043) was observed for the depression score. The positive results of the feasibility study encourage further work and reinforce the positioning of medical imaging as a tool for therapeutic patient education.",['Kirkove D; Ben Mustapha S; Jodogne S; Pétré B'],2024,experimental feasibility study was carried out in the radiotherapy department of the university hospital of Liège on adult patients with cancer or pulmonary metastases. the patients of the experimental group benefited from an intervention consisting in the 3D visualization of their own medical images via the free and open-source computer software «Stone of Orthanc»
Cross-sectional association of continuous glucose monitoring-derived metrics with cerebral small vessel disease in older adults with type 2 diabetes.,"To examine cross-sectional associations between continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived metrics and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) in older adults with type 2 diabetes. In total, 80 patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥70 years were analysed. Participants underwent CGM for 14 days. From the CGM data, we derived mean sensor glucose, percentage glucose coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glucose excursion, time in range (TIR, 70-180 mg/dl), time above range (TAR) and time below range metrics, glycaemia risk index and high/low blood glucose index. The presence of cerebral SVD, including lacunes, microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces and white matter hyperintensities, was assessed, and the total number of these findings comprised the total cerebral SVD score (0-4). Ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the association of CGM-derived metrics with the total SVD score. The median SVD score was 1 (interquartile range 0-2). Higher hyperglycaemic metrics, including mean sensor glucose, TAR >180 mg/dl, TAR >250 mg/dl, and high blood glucose index and glycaemia risk index, were associated with a higher total SVD score. In contrast, a higher TIR (per 10% increase) was associated with a lower total SVD score (odds ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.56-0.95). Glycated haemoglobin, percentage glucose coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glucose excursions, time below range and low blood glucose index were not associated with total cerebral SVD scores.

A case of new-onset Fulminant type 1 diabetes after secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Fulminant type 1 diabetes is a subtype of type 1 diabetes characterised by a rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis combined with a background of rapid and almost complete pancreatic islet destruction. FT1D induced by secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare. Herein, we present the case of a 42-year-old male patient with new-onset FT1D after a secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection, with recurrent hyperglycaemia and ketosis as the primary manifestations. Eventually, the patient responded well after receiving more than 50 units of insulin daily. This case illustrates the importance of paying attention to severe hyperglycaemia accompanying recurrent ketosis, particularly among patients with secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection.",['Wang J; Huang Y; Tao F'],2024,FT1D induced by secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare. a 42-year-old male patient with new-onset FT1D is diagnosed with recurrent hyperglycaemia and ketosis. recurrent ketosis is the primary manifestation of the disease.
Clinical biomarkers for thyroid immune-related adverse events in patients with stage III and IV gastrointestinal tumors.,"Thyroid immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment appear to correlate with a better prognosis. We aimed to investigate clinical biomarkers associated with thyroid irAEs. We retrospectively analyzed data from 129 patients receiving programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors for stage III and IV gastrointestinal tumors. Patients were divided into two groups: ""thyroid irAEs"" group and ""no thyroid irAEs"" group. We compared continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests and categorical variables using Pearson's chi-square test. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and associations between clinical features and thyroid irAEs were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Associations for thyroid irAEs and outcomes [progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)] of the patients were performed with a Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 129 patients, including 66 gastric cancer, 30 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and 33 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), were involved in this analysis with 47 cases of thyroid irAEs occurrence. The Cox proportional hazard model analysis confirmed the extended PFS [hazard rate (HR) = 0.447, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.215 to 0.931, <i>p</i> = 0.031] and OS (HR = 0.424, 95% CI: 0.201 to 0.893, <i>p</i> = 0.024) for thyroid irAEs group when compared with those of the no thyroid irAEs group. Association between thyroid irAEs and clinical characteristics at baseline was analyzed subsequently by univariate analysis. Higher body mass index (<i>p</i> = 0.005), increased eosinophil count (<i>p</i> = 0.014), increased lactate dehydrogenase (<i>p</i> = 0.008), higher baseline thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (<i>p</i> = 0.001), HCC (<i>p</i> = 0.001) and increased adenosine deaminase (ADA) (<i>p</i> = 0.001) were linked with thyroid irAEs occurrence. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that ADA [odds rate (OR) = 4.756, 95% CI: 1.147 to 19.729, <i>p</i> = 0.032] was independently associated with thyroid irAEs occurrence. Increased baseline level of ADA was associated with thyroid irAEs occurrence in patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors who received ICI treatment. In the case of abnormal ADA, attention should be paid to the risk of thyroid irAEs.",['Xing N; Liu J; Hou L; Zhao Y; Ma H; Wang F; Guo Z'],2024,irAEs associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment appear to correlate with a better prognosis. a total of 129 patients were involved in this analysis with 47 cases of thyroid irAEs occurrence.

Correlation study of serum lipid levels and lipid metabolism-related genes in cervical cancer.,"Lipid metabolism plays an important role in cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lipid metabolism and the development of cervical cancer, and to explore the prognostic significance of lipid metabolism-related genes in patients with cervical cancer. Initially, we retrospectively collected data from 1589 cervical cancer patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, with 1589 healthy individuals from the physical examination center serving as the control group. The correlation between their serum lipid levels and cervical cancer was analyzed. Subsequently, leveraging public databases, we conducted comprehensive studies on lipid metabolism-related genes. Additionally, we analyzed RNA expression profiling and clinical information sourced from TCGA and GTEx databases. Finally, we established a prognostic model integrating 9 genes associated with lipid metabolism and generated a nomogram model using R. GO and KEGG were performed to explore the functions and pathways of lipid metabolism-related genes. Our findings revealed that patients with cervical cancer exhibited dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C, alongside reduced HDL-C levels compared to controls (P<0.05). Interestingly, compared with early-stage patients, advanced patients had lower HDL-C level and higher LDL-C level. Regression analysis further highlighted high TC, TG, and LDL-C as significant risk factors for cervical cancer. Then a total of 188 lipid metabolism-related genes were identified and a prognostic signature based on 9 genes was established and validated. The results of the GO and KEGG functional analysis indicated that the lipid metabolism-related genes are primarily concentrated on pathways associated with fatty acid metabolism. Our study underscores the varying degrees of dyslipidemia observed in patients with cervical cancer, emphasizing the relevance of serum lipids in disease development. Our prognostic riskScore model predicted the overall survival time of patients based on 9 genes associated with lipid metabolism. These 9 genes may be tumor biomarkers and new targets for the treatment of cervical cancer.",['Cheng L; Li Z; Zheng Q; Yao Q'],2024,lipid metabolism plays an important role in cervical cancer. the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between lipid metabolism and the development of cervical cancer.
Fractures in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From a 20-year Registry at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor of infection. Although DM has been associated with worse functional outcomes after acetabular fracture, literature regarding the effect of DM on surgical site infection and other early complications is lacking. A 20-year registry from a level 1 trauma center was queried to identify 134 patients with DM and 345 nondiabetic patients with acetabular fractures. The diabetic patient population was older (57.2 versus 43.2; P < 0.001) and had higher average body mass index (33.6 versus 29.5; P < 0.001). Eighty-three patients with DM and 270 nondiabetics were treated surgically (62% versus 78%; P < 0.001). Diabetic patients who were younger (54.6 versus 61.4; P = 0.01) with fewer comorbidities (1.7 versus 2.2; P = 0.04) were more frequently managed surgically. On univariate analysis, patients with DM more commonly developed any early infection (28.4% versus 21%; P = 0.049) but were no more likely to develop surgical site infection, or other postoperative complications. Older patient age, length of stay, baseline pulmonary disease, and concurrent abdominal injury were independent predictors of postoperative infection other than surgical site infection. Diabetics that developed infection had more comorbidities (2.4 versus 1.5; P < 0.001) and higher Injury Severity Score (24.1 versus 15.8; P = 0.003), and were more frequently insulin-dependent (72.7% versus 41%; P = 0.01). Independent of management strategy, diabetic patients were more likely to develop an infection after acetabular fracture. Insulin dependence was associated with postoperative infection on univariate analysis.

Circadian regulation of macromolecular complex turnover and proteome renewal.,"Although costly to maintain, protein homeostasis is indispensable for normal cellular function and long-term health. In mammalian cells and tissues, daily variation in global protein synthesis has been observed, but its utility and consequences for proteome integrity are not fully understood. Using several different pulse-labelling strategies, here we gain direct insight into the relationship between protein synthesis and abundance proteome-wide. We show that protein degradation varies in-phase with protein synthesis, facilitating rhythms in turnover rather than abundance. This results in daily consolidation of proteome renewal whilst minimising changes in composition. Coupled rhythms in synthesis and turnover are especially salient to the assembly of macromolecular protein complexes, particularly the ribosome, the most abundant species of complex in the cell. Daily turnover and proteasomal degradation rhythms render cells and mice more sensitive to proteotoxic stress at specific times of day, potentially contributing to daily rhythms in the efficacy of proteasomal inhibitors against cancer. Our findings suggest that circadian rhythms function to minimise the bioenergetic cost of protein homeostasis through temporal consolidation of protein turnover.","[""Seinkmane E; Edmondson A; Peak-Chew SY; Zeng A; Rzechorzek NM; James NR; West J; Munns J; Wong DC; Beale AD; O'Neill JS""]",2024,"protein homeostasis is essential for normal cellular function and long-term health. in mammalian cells and tissues, daily variation in global protein synthesis has been observed. this results in daily consolidation of proteome renewal."
High red blood cell folate is associated with an increased risk of diabetes death among a hypertensive cohort.,"The relationship between folate and diabetes remains inconclusive, possibly because of folate measured differentially between studies. Interference from mandatory folic acid fortification (FAF) has also been blamed. With both folate intake and circulating concentration measured, we assessed the relationship between folate and the risk of diabetes death in a hypertensive cohort established before FAF. We hypothesized that the association between folate and diabetes death is measurement dependent. We analyzed the data of 3133 hypertensive adults aged ≥19 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1991-1994) and were followed up through December 31, 2010. Hazard ratios of diabetes death were estimated for participants with high (4th quartile) folate compared with those with moderate (2nd and 3rd quartiles) or low (1st quartile) concentrations of folate. Dietary folate intake, total folate intake (including folate from supplements), serum, and red blood cell (RBC) folate were measured. After 42,025 person-years of follow-up, 165 diabetes deaths were recorded, and a dose-response positive association was observed between diabetes death and RBC folate. The adjusted hazard ratios of diabetes death were 1.00 (reference), 1.80 (95% CI. 1.52-2.13), and 2.33 (1.80-3.02), respectively, for hypertensive adults with low, moderate, and high RBC folate. No association was detected between diabetes death and serum folate concentration, folate intake, or either dietary intake or total intake. With minimized interference from FAF, neither dietary nor serum folate was associated with diabetes death, but elevated RBC folate was associated with a high risk of diabetes deaths among hypertensive patients.",['Twum F; Cowan L; Yu L; Afriyie-Gyawu E; Zhang J'],2024,relationship between folate and diabetes death remains inconclusive. a dose-response positive association was observed between diabetes death and circulating concentration.

Validation of mobile phone use recall in the multinational MOBI-kids study.,"Potential differential and non-differential recall error in mobile phone use (MPU) in the multinational MOBI-Kids case-control study were evaluated. We compared self-reported MPU with network operator billing record data up to 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years before the interview date from 702 subjects aged between 10 and 24 years in eight countries. Spearman rank correlations, Kappa coefficients and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were used. No material differences in MPU recall estimates between cases and controls were observed. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients between self-reported and recorded MPU in the most recent 3 months were 0.57 and 0.59 for call number and for call duration, respectively. The number of calls was on average underestimated by the participants (GMR = 0.69), while the duration of calls was overestimated (GMR = 1.59). Country, years since start of using a mobile phone, age at time of interview, and sex did not appear to influence recall accuracy for either call number or call duration. A trend in recall error was seen with level of self-reported MPU, with underestimation of use at lower levels and overestimation of use at higher levels for both number and duration of calls. Although both systematic and random errors in self-reported MPU among participants were observed, there was no evidence of differential recall error between cases and controls.

Relationship between oral microbiota and colorectal cancer: A systematic review.,"This systematic review aims to investigate the microbial basis underlying the association between oral microbiota and colorectal cancer. A comprehensive search was conducted across four databases, encompassing potentially relevant studies published up to April 2024 related to the PECO question: ""Is there a differentiation in oral microbial composition between adult patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer compared to healthy patients?"". The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate the quality of the studies included. The level of evidence was assessed through the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) tool. Sixteen studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Based on low to moderate evidence profile, high levels of certain subspecies within Firmicutes (such as Streptococcus anginosus, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, S. koreensis, and S. gallolyticus), Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria oralis were found to be associated with colorectal cancer. Conversely, certain bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, F. periodonticum, and P. melaninogenica) could exert a symbiotic protective effect against colorectal cancer. Based on existing evidence, it appears that variations in oral microbiota composition exist among individuals with and without colorectal cancer. However, further research is necessary to determine the mechanisms of oral dysbiosis in colorectal carcinogenesis.",['Camañes-Gonzalvo S; Montiel-Company JM; Lobo-de-Mena M; Safont-Aguilera MJ; Fernández-Diaz A; López-Roldán A; Paredes-Gallardo V; Bellot-Arcís C'],2024,systematic review aims to investigate the microbial basis underlying the association between oral microbiota and colorectal cancer. the results were based on a low to moderate evidence profile. a study was conducted across four databases.
The health care experience of adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and influence of PNPLA3: A qualitative study.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, for which there is limited information about patient experience, including the patient journey. In this study, we conducted interviews with patients with MASH to qualitatively evaluate the patient journey and help elucidate the experiences of this patient population. We also investigated if the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) I148M variant (non-Hispanic) or being of Hispanic ethnicity may influence patient experiences because these 2 subgroups develop advanced liver disease more frequently than other patient groups. One-to-one interviews were conducted with 28 adults (with PNPLA3 I148M genetic variant, n = 10; Hispanic, n = 8) living in the United States who had been diagnosed with MASH with liver fibrosis. Patients were asked open-ended questions about their experiences before, at, and after their diagnosis. The data collected found that patients experienced a long process of misdiagnoses before their diagnosis of MASH, a lack of clear information provided by clinicians, and limited accessibility to support groups. Hispanic patients reported ""impact on family/friends"" (75%) and ""fear of disease progression"" (75%) more frequently than the other patient cohorts interviewed. This is the first report of ""fear of progression"" in patients with MASH. No patients who were White and had the PNPLA3 I148M variant reported nausea/vomiting, in contrast to other patient cohorts. This qualitative study identified key aspects of the patient journey that are important for clinical providers and medical teams to recognize. We also propose a new algorithm that could be developed to help screen relatives of patients who are found to carry the PNPLA3 I148M variant.",['Stine JG; Medic N; Pettersson B; Venerus M; Blau JE'],2024,"metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. there is limited information about patient experience, including the patient journey. one-to-one interviews were conducted with 28 adults living in the united states."
Burden of Disease Study of Patients with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Spain.,"Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a progressive retinal disease that causes severe and irreversible vision loss. The disease can therefore have a significant impact on the life of patients' and their families. The aim of this study was to evaluate the socio-economic burden of nAMD in Spain. The annual cost per patient with nAMD was estimated for the first, second, and third year (or beyond) of treatment since diagnosis. Several cost categories were considered including direct healthcare costs (DHC), direct non-healthcare costs (DNHC), labor productivity losses (LPL), and intangible costs (IC) related to loss of quality of life. The average annual cost per patient was estimated by assigning a unit price or financial proxy to the resources consumed per patient. Reference year of costs was 2021. The mean annual cost of nAMD was estimated at €17,265, €15,403, and €14,465 per patient in the first, second, and third year of treatment after diagnosis. There was an additional one-off cost of €744 associated with the diagnosis of nAMD. DHC accounted for most of the total annual cost per patient independent of the year of treatment since diagnosis (48% in year 1; 42% in year 2; 39% in year 3). Similarly, DNHC had an important contribution to the total costs (32% in year 1; 35% in year 2; 37% in year 3), followed by IC (20% in year 1; 23% in year 2; 24% in year 3), while the contribution of patients' LPL was minimal. This study estimated a high economic burden associated with nAMD for patients and their families, the healthcare system, and society at large. There is a need to improve the management of these patients to reduce the impact of nAMD disease progression.",['Abraldes MJ; Calvo P; Gámez Lechuga M; Merino M; Martín Lorenzo T; Maravilla-Herrera P; Gil Jiménez B; Ruiz-Moreno JM'],2024,"the annual cost per patient with nAMD was estimated for the first, second, and third year (or beyond) of treatment since diagnosis. the average annual cost per patient was estimated by assigning a unit price or financial proxy to the resources consumed per patient. the mean annual cost per patient was estimated at €17,265, €15,403, and €14,465 per patient in the first, second, and third year (or beyond) of treatment since diagnosis."
Application of short T1 inversion recovery sequence in increased signal intensity following cervical spondylotic myelopathy.,"To compare magnetic resonance (MR) short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequence with MR T2-weighted (T2W) sequence for detecting increased signal intensity (ISI) and assessing outcomes of ISI in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Data of patients with CSM who showed ISI on MR imaging and had undergone cervical spine surgery were retrospectively reviewed. STIR and T2W images were examined to assess signal intensity ratio (SIR), length and grading of the ISI, maximal spinal cord compression (MSCC), canal narrowing ratio (CNR), and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (LFH). The patients were divided into good and poor groups based on their outcomes. Chi-square tests and variance analysis were used to assess intergroup differences. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for poor outcomes, and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to detect prognostic effects. SIR and ISI lengths were significantly different between the STIR and T2 images. In the univariate logistic regression analysis, age, diabetes, SIR<sub>T2</sub>, SIR<sub>STIR</sub>, and ISI<sub>STIR</sub> grading were significant factors. Accordingly, in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, diabetes, SIR<sub>T2</sub>, and SIR<sub>STIR</sub> were included in the model. Among patients with diabetes, we observed a significant difference between SIR<sub>T2</sub> and SIR<sub>STIR</sub>. The STIR sequence demonstrated superior capability to the T2W sequence in detecting ISI; however, there was no obvious difference in predicted outcomes. STIR sequence has a better prognostic value than T2W sequence in patients with diabetes who have CSM. ISI grading based on the STIR sequence may be a clinically valuable indicator.",['Wang H; Ye W; Xiong J; Gao Y; Ge X; Wang J; Zhu Y; Tang P; Zhou Y; Wang X; Gu Y; Liu W; Luo Y; Cai W'],2024,MR short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequence with MR T2-weighted (T2W) sequence.

A nomogram of anastomotic stricture after rectal cancer: a retrospective cohort analysis.,"Anastomotic stricture significantly impacts patients' quality of life and long-term prognosis. However, current clinical practice lacks accurate tools for predicting anastomotic stricture. This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict anastomotic stricture in patients with rectal cancer who have undergone anterior resection. A total of 1542 eligible patients were recruited for the study. Least absolute shrinkage selection operator (Lasso) analysis was used to preliminarily select predictors. A prediction model was constructed using multivariate logistic regression and presented as a nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration diagrams, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Internal validation was conducted by assessing the model's performance on a validation cohort. 72 (4.7%) patients were diagnosed with anastomotic stricture. Participants were randomly divided into training (n = 1079) and validation (n = 463) sets. Predictors included in this nomogram were radiotherapy, diverting stoma, anastomotic leakage, and anastomotic distance. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the training set was 0.889 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.840-0.937] and for the validation set, it was 0.930 (95%CI 0.879-0.981). The calibration curve demonstrated a strong correlation between predicted and observed outcomes. DCA results showed that the nomogram had clinical value in predicting anastomotic stricture in patients after anterior resection of rectal cancer. We developed a predictive model for anastomotic stricture following anterior resection of rectal cancer. This nomogram could assist clinicians in predicting the risk of anastomotic stricture, thus improving patients' quality of life and long-term prognosis.",['Cheng Y; Tian Z; Gao S; Zhao S; Li R; Zhou J; Sun Q; Wang D'],2024,a nomogram was developed to predict anastomotic stricture in patients with rectal cancer who have undergone anterior resection. a total of 1542 eligible patients were recruited for the study.
Aristolochic Acid Exposure via Dermal Contact or Inhalation of Herbal Powders: Evidence of Occupational Exposure in Herbalists with Urothelial Cancer.,"Emerging evidence showing urothelial cancer in herbalists is linked to aristolochic acid (AA) exposure; however, the exposure pathway remains unclear. Here, we show that dermal contact and inhalation of fine powders of AA-containing herbs are significant occupational AA exposure pathways for herbalists. We initiated the study by quantifying the amount of AA in the AA-containing powder deposited on gloves and face masks worn by the operators of an AA-containing herb grinding machine. Then, we measured the kinetics of dermal absorption and dissolution of AA from fine powders of AA-containing herbs into artificial sweat and surrogate lung fluid. Lastly, we quantified the mutagenic AA-DNA adduct levels formed in the kidneys of mice exposed to AA-containing fine powders through dermal contact. Our findings highlight an urgent occupational risk that should demand implementation of safety standards for herbalists exposed to AA-containing fine powders.",['Kwok HC; Chan W'],2024,urothelial cancer in herbalists is linked to aristolochic acid exposure. the exposure pathway remains unclear.
Estimating pathological prognostic factors in epithelial ovarian cancers using apparent diffusion coefficients of functional tumor volume.,"To assess the utility of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of whole tumor volume (WTV) and functional tumor volume (FTV) in determining the pathologicalprognostic factors in epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs). A total of 155 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with EOC between January 2017 and August 2022 and underwent both conventional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging were assessed in this study. The maximum, minimum, and mean ADC values of the whole tumor (ADCwmax, ADCwmin, and ADCwmean, respectively) and functional tumor (ADCfmax, ADCfmin, and ADCfmean, respectively) as well as the WTV and FTV were derived from the ADC maps. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to assess the correlation between these ADC values and the pathological prognostic factors, namely subtypes, lymph node metastasis (LNM), Ki-67 index, and p53 expression. The ADCfmean value was significantly lower in type II EOC, LNM-positive, and high-Ki-67 index groups compared to the type I EOC, LNM-negative, and low-Ki-67 index groups (p ≤ 0.001). Similarly, the ADCwmean and ADCfmean values were lower in the mutant-p53 group compared to the wild-type-p53 group (p ≤ 0.001). Additionally, the ADCfmean showed the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) for evaluating type II EOC (0.725), LNM-positive (0.782), and high-Ki-67 index (0.688) samples among the given ROC curves, while both ADCwmean and ADCfmean showed high AUCs for assessing p53 expression (0.694 and 0.678, respectively). The FTV-derived ADC values, especially ADCfmean, can be used to assess preoperative prognostic factors in EOCs.",['Zhang C; Ma L; Zhao Y; Zhang Z; Zhang Q; Li X; Qin J; Ren Y; Hu Z; Zhao Q; Shen W; Cheng Y'],2024,"total of 155 patients were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancers. the total of 155 patients were assessed in this study. the maximum, minimum, and mean ADC values of whole tumor and functional tumor were derived from the ADC maps."
Normal and abnormal glycogen structure - A review.,"Glycogen, a complex branched glucose polymer, is found in animals and bacteria, where it serves as an energy storage molecule. It has linear (1 → 4)-α glycosidic bonds between anhydroglucose monomer units, with branch points connected by (1 → 6)-α bonds. Individual glycogen molecules are referred to as β particles. In organs like the liver and heart, these β particles can bind into larger aggregate α particles, which exhibit a rosette-like morphology. The mechanisms and bonding underlying the aggregation process are not fully understood. For example, mammalian liver glycogen has been observed to be molecularly fragile under certain conditions, such as glycogen from diabetic livers fragmenting when exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), while glycogen from healthy livers is much less fragile; this indicates some difference, as yet unknown, in the bonding between β particles in healthy and diabetic glycogen. This fragility may have implications for blood sugar regulation, especially in pathological conditions such as diabetes.",['Liu X; Gilbert RG'],2024,"a complex branched glucose polymer is found in animals and bacteria. it has linear (1  4)- glycosidic bonds between anhydroglucose monomer units. in organs like the liver and heart, these  particles can bind into larger aggregate  particles."

This provides new evidence for secondary prevention, including precision screening, and offers new ideas for improving the diagnosis and treatment of EOCRC.",['Hu YT; Xiao Q; Ding KF; Zheng S'],2024,"the incidence and mortality rates of early-onset colorectal cancer are showing an upward trend. traditional epidemiological studies have conducted relatively deep research. but our understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and treatment of this disease is far from sufficient."
The impact of time between surgery and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.,"In advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), adjuvant therapy (AT) is an important part of the treatment to ensure extended locoregional control after primary surgical resection. The impact of the time interval between surgery and AT on the oncological prognosis remains unclear, particularly in high-risk constellations. The aim of this study is to categorize treatment delays and to determine their impact on the oncological prognosis within the context of the histopathological risk parameters of patients with advanced OSCC. In this single-institutional retrospective cohort study, all patients treated for OSCC between 2016 and 2021 and who received postoperative chemoradiation (POCRT) were included. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I: ≤ 6 weeks between surgery and POCRT; and Group II: > 6 weeks between surgery and POCRT. Overall, 202 patients were included (Group I: 156 (77.2%) vs. Group II: 46 (22.8%)). There were no statistically significant differences in epidemiological aspects and histopathological risk factors between the two groups. The maximum time to initiation of POCRT was 11 weeks. Delayed POCRT initiation had no statistically significant influence on the 5-year OS (61.6% vs. 57.3%, p = 0.89), locoregional control rate (38.6% vs. 43.3%, p = 0.57), and RFS (32.3% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.21). On multivariate analysis, extracapsular spread (HR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.21 - 4.04, p = 0.01) and incomplete surgical resection (HR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.69, p = 0.02) were significantly correlated with OS. For RFS, ECS (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.15 - 2.86, p = 0.01), incomplete resection (HR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.04 - 2.71, p = 0.04), and vascular infiltration of the tumor (V-stage; HR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.08 - 4.27, p = 0.03) were significant risk predictors. Delays in POCRT initiation up to 11 weeks after surgical resection for advanced OSCC were not statistically significantly associated with impaired survival. In cases of prolonged surgical treatment due to management of complications, a small delay in AT beyond the recommended time limit may be justified and AT should still be pursued.",['Mrosk F; Absah M; Richter M; Sprünken E; Doll C; Kreutzer K; Rendenbach C; Beck M; Klinghammer K; Heiland M; Koerdt S'],2024,adjuvant therapy (AT) is an important part of the treatment to ensure extended locoregional control after primary surgical resection. the impact of the time interval between surgery and AT on the oncological prognosis remains unclear.
Comparative toxicological assessment of cigarettes and new category products via an <i>in vitro</i> multiplex proteomics platform.,"Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for several diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Alternative nicotine products with reduced risk potential (RRPs) including tobacco heating products (THPs), and e-cigarettes have recently emerged as viable alternatives to cigarettes that may contribute to the overall strategy of tobacco harm reduction due to the significantly lower levels of toxicants in these products' emissions as compared to cigarette smoke. Assessing the effects of RRPs on biological responses is important to demonstrate the potential value of RRPs towards tobacco harm reduction. Here, we evaluated the inflammatory and signaling responses of human lung epithelial cells to aqueous aerosol extracts (AqE) generated from the 1R6F reference cigarette, the glo™ THP, and the Vype ePen 3.0 e-cigarette using multiplex analysis of 37 inflammatory and phosphoprotein markers. Cellular exposure to the different RRPs and 1R6F AqEs resulted in distinct response profiles with 1R6F being the most biologically active followed by glo™ and ePen 3.0. 1R6F activated stress-related and pro-survival markers c-JUN, CREB1, p38 MAPK and MEK1 and led to the release of IL-1α. glo™ activated MEK1 and decreased IL-1β levels, whilst ePen 3.0 affected IL-1β levels but had no effect on the signaling activity compared to untreated cells. Our results demonstrated the reduced biological effect of RRPs and suggest that targeted analysis of inflammatory and cell signaling mediators is a valuable tool for the routine assessment of RRPs.",['Tsolakos N; Haswell LE; Miazzi F; Bishop E; Antoranz A; Pliaka V; Minia A; Alexopoulos LG; Gaca M; Breheny D'],2024,alternative nicotine products with reduced risk potential (RRPs) including tobacco heating products (THPs) and e-cigarettes have emerged as viable alternatives to cigarettes. e-cigarettes have recently emerged as viable alternatives to cigarettes.
Mitigation of ROS-triggered endoplasmic reticulum stress by upregulating Nrf2 retards diabetic nephropathy.,"Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN), and it is often accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the precise relationship between NFE2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of ROS balance, and ERS in DN remains elusive. This study aimed to investigate the impact of Nrf2 on ERS and its therapeutic potential in DN. Herein, ERS-related changes, including increased activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, were observed in the renal tissues of streptozotocin-induced DN mice and high glucose cultured human renal proximal tubular (HK-2) cells. Nrf2 knockdown increased the sensitivity of HK-2 cells to ERS under high glucose conditions, underscoring the regulatory role of Nrf2 in ERS modulation. Notably, upregulating Nrf2 in ezetimibe-treated diabetic mice restored ERS markers and ameliorated albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial expansion, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, the inhibition of ERS in HK-2 cells by the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine, highlights the interplay between ROS and ERS. This study, for the first time, elucidates that the upregulation of Nrf2 may alleviate the negative influence of ROS-mediated ERS, presenting a promising therapeutic avenue for delaying the progression of DN. These findings suggest a potential strategy for targeting Nrf2 and ERS in developing novel therapeutic interventions for DN.",['Zeng X; Zhang Y; Tian L; Zheng Y; Zhang J; Wu Z'],2024,"ERS plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.

Common and distinct risk profiles of asymptomatic extra- and intracranial atherosclerosis in the Nagahama cohort.,"Atherosclerotic burden increases the risk of both extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS) and intracranial large artery disease (ICAD). However, the differences in risk profiles have not been thoroughly investigated. Participants were recruited from the Nagahama study cohort in Japan. Individuals over 60 years old who underwent 1.5-T head and neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) between July 2013 and February 2017 were included. ICAD was defined as WASID ≥ 50%, and ICS was defined as NSCET ≥ 30%. The prevalence and association of risk factors, including proatherogenic and proinflammatory factors, and the p.R4810K variant in the RNF213 gene, were investigated. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. A total of 3089 individuals participated in the study, with a mean age of 68.1 ± 5.3 years, and 36.0% were males. Among them, 52 (1.7%) had ICS, 119 (3.8%) had ICAD, and 15 (0.49%) had both conditions. Alopecia areata was an independent predictor for both ICS (Odds ratio [OR] 3.5; 95% CI 1.3-8.3) and ICAD (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.0-3.9). Diabetes (OR 3.7; 95% CI 2.0-7.0) and older age (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.2-4.5) were associated only with ICS, while the RNF213 variant was associated with only ICAD (OR 5.7; 95% CI 1.6-16.0). ICS and ICAD were also independently associated with each other. In this MRA-based large scale study, alopecia areata, known as a systemic inflammatory disease, was shown to be a common risk factor for ICS and ICAD. While conventional atherosclerotic factors were associated with ICS, non-atherosclerotic factors appear to contribute to ICAD in Japan.",['Suzuki M; Mineharu Y; Okawa M; Yoshida K; Nagata M; Yang T; Suzuki K; Takayama N; Yamamoto Y; Tabara Y; Miyamoto S; Arakawa Y; Matsuda F'],2024,"participants recruited from the Nagahama study cohort in japan.

Chemerin regulates glucose and lipid metabolism by changing mitochondrial structure and function associated with androgen/androgen receptor.,"The adipokine chemerin contributes to exercise-induced improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to confirm the impact of reduced chemerin expression on exercise-induced improvement in glycolipid metabolism in male diabetic (DM) mice through exogenous chemerin administration. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of chemerin involved in changes in muscle mitochondria function mediated by androgen/androgen receptor (AR) was explored by generating adipose-specific and global chemerin knockout (adipo-chemerin-/- and chemerin-/-) mice. DM mice were categorized into the DM, exercised DM (EDM), and EDM + chemerin supplementation groups. Adipo-chemerin-/- and chemerin-/- mice were classified in the sedentary or exercised groups and fed either a normal or high-fat diet. Exercise mice underwent a 6-week aerobic exercise regimen. The serum testosterone and chemerin levels, glycolipid metabolism indices, mitochondrial function, and protein levels involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics were measured. Notably, exogenous chemerin reversed exercise-induced improvements in glycolipid metabolism, AR protein levels, mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial fusion in DM mice. Moreover, adipose-specific chemerin knockout improved glycolipid metabolism, enhanced exercise-induced increases in testosterone and AR levels in exercised mice, and alleviated the detrimental effects of a high-fat diet on mitochondrial morphology, biogenesis, and dynamics. Finally, similar improvements in glucose metabolism (but not lipid metabolism), mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial dynamics were observed in chemerin-/- mice. In conclusion, decreased chemerin levels affect exercise-induced improvements in glycolipid metabolism in male mice by increasing mitochondrial number and function, likely through changes in androgen/AR signaling.",['Yin L; Tang H; Qu J; Jia Y; Zhang Q; Wang X'],2024,adipokine chemerin contributes to exercise-induced improvements in glycolipid metabolism. exogenous chemerin administration compared exercise-induced improvements in glycolipid metabolism. adipose-specific chemerin knockout improved glycolipid metabolism.
PSMC5 insufficiency and P320R mutation impair proteasome function.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system mediates the degradation of a wide variety of proteins. Proteasome dysfunction is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. Here we identified mutations in PSMC5, an AAA ATPase subunit of the proteasome 19S regulatory particle, in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, which were initially considered as variants of unknown significance. We have now found heterozygotes with the following mutations: P320R (6 individuals), R325W, Q160A, and one nonsense mutation at Q69. We focused on understanding the functional consequence of PSMC5 insufficiency and the P320R mutation in cells and found that both impair proteasome function and activate apoptosis. Interestingly, the P320R mutation impairs proteasome function by weakening the association between the 19S regulatory particle and the 20S core particle. Our study supports that proteasome dysfunction is the pathogenic cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in individuals carrying PSMC5 variants.","[""Yu ZQ; Carmichael J; Collins GA; D'Agostino MD; Lessard M; Firth HV; Harijan P; Fry AE; Dean J; Zhang J; Kini U; Goldberg AL; Rubinsztein DC""]",2024,mutations in PSMC5 in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. mutations in the proteasome 19S regulatory particle impair proteasome function.
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Pregnancy Complications and Outcomes: A Mendelian Randomization Study and Retrospective Validation.,"Previous studies have shown that pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) tend to have a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, but the potential causal role remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between SLE and some common pregnancy complications and outcomes using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). The genetic tools were derived from genome-wide association studies of SLE and pregnancy complications and outcomes. MR analysis was performed using inverse variance weighting as primary method. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 200 pregnant women with SLE and a control group of pregnant women delivering at Tongji Hospital. In the results, we found that genetic susceptibility to SLE was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.028, 95% CI: 1.006-1.050), premature delivery (OR = 1.039, 95% CI: 1.013-1.066), polyhydramnios (OR = 1.075, 95% CI: 1.004-1.151) and premature rupture of membranes (OR = 1.030, 95% CI: 1.001-1.060). Some of the retrospective analysis results align with the findings from the MR analysis, indicating that pregnant women with SLE have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus and preterm birth. Additionally, although MR analysis did not reveal a causal relationship between SLE and preeclampsia/eclampsia, retrospective analysis discovered that SLE pregnant women are more susceptible to developing preeclampsia/eclampsia (OR = 2.935, 95% CI: 1.118-7.620). Our study findings suggest a potential causal relationship between SLE and increased risks of gestational diabetes and preterm delivery. Clinical data indicate that pregnant women with SLE are more prone to developing preeclampsia/eclampsia. Clinicians need to be vigilant about the occurrence of these conditions when managing pregnant women with SLE.",['Zhu S; Ren J; Feng L; Jiang Y'],2024,MR analysis was performed using inverse variance weighting as primary method. genetic susceptibility to SLE was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.

Healing the diabetic wound: Unlocking the secrets of genes and pathways.,"Diabetic wounds (DWs) are open sores that can occur anywhere on a diabetic patient's body. They are often complicated by infections, hypoxia, oxidative stress, hyperglycemia, and reduced growth factors and nucleic acids. The healing process involves four phases: homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling, regulated by various cellular and molecular events. Numerous genes and signaling pathways such as VEGF, TGF-β, NF-κB, PPAR-γ, MMPs, IGF, FGF, PDGF, EGF, NOX, TLR, JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK, ERK, JNK, p38, Wnt/β-catenin, Hedgehog, Notch, Hippo, FAK, Integrin, and Src pathways are involved in these events.

Augmenter of liver regeneration knockout aggravates tubular ferroptosis and macrophage activation by regulating carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A-induced lipid metabolism in diabetic nephropathy.,"Ferroptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death that performs a critical function in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) exists in the inner membrane of mitochondria, and inhibits inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in acute kidney injury; however, its role in DN remains unexplored. Here, we aimed to identify the role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN. The expression of ALR was examined in DN patients, db/db DN mice, and HK-2 cells treated with high glucose (HG). The effects of ALR on ferroptosis and macrophage activation were investigated with ALR conditional knockout, lentivirus transfection, transmission electron microscopy, qRT-PCR and western blotting assay. Mass spectrometry and rescue experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism of ALR. ALR expression was reduced in the kidney tissues of DN patients and mice, serum of DN patients, and HG-HK-2 cells. Moreover, the inhibition of ALR promoted ferroptosis, macrophage activation, and DN progression. Mechanistically, ALR can directly bind to carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A), the key rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and inhibit the expression of CPT1A to regulate lipid metabolism involving FAO and lipid droplet-mitochondrial coupling in DN. Taken together, our findings revealed a crucial protective role of ALR in ferroptosis induction and macrophage activation in DN and identified it as an alternative diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for DN.",['Zhang Y; Zhang Z; Huang L; Wang C; Yang P; Zhang L; Liao X'],2024,ferroptosis is a novel type of programmed cell death that performs a critical function in diabetic nephropathy (DN) the role of ALR in DN remains unexplored.
Utility of abbreviated MRI in the post-treatment evaluation of rectal cancer.,"Post-treatment evaluation of patients with rectal cancer (RC) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burdens medical resources, necessitating an exploration of abbreviated protocols. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of abbreviated MRI (A-MRI) for the post-treatment evaluation of RC patients. This retrospective study included RC patients who underwent non-contrast rectal MRI and standard liver MRI, as well as abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) for post-treatment evaluation. A-MRI comprised diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging of the upper abdomen and the pelvic cavity. Three radiologists independently reviewed A-MRI, CECT, and standard liver MRI in the detection of viable disease. The diagnostic performances were compared using a reference standard considering all available information, including pathology, FDG-PET, endoscopic results, and clinical follow-up. We included 78 patients (50 men, 28 women; mean age=60.9 ± 10.2 years) and observed viable disease in 34 (43.6%). On a per-patient-basis analysis, A-MRI showed significantly higher sensitivity (95% vs. 81%, <i>P </i>= 0.04) and higher accuracy (93% vs. 82%, <i>P </i>< 0.01), compared to those of CECT, while A-MRI showed comparable sensitivity (91% vs. 91%, <i>P </i>= 0.42) and accuracy (97% vs. 98%, <i>P</i> = 0.06) to that of standard liver MRI. On a per-lesion-based analysis, A-MRI exhibited significantly superior lesion detectability than that of CECT (figure of merit 0.91 vs. 0.77, <i>P </i>< 0.01) and comparable to that of standard liver MRI (figure of merit 0.91 vs. 0.92, <i>P = </i>0.75).

Sex differences in the trajectories of cognitive decline and affected cognitive domains among older adults with controlled and uncontrolled glycemia.,"We aimed to analyze the trajectories of cognitive decline as a function of the presence of type 2 diabetes and glycemic control in analyzes stratified by sex in an eight-year follow-up period. A total of 1,752 men and 2,232 women aged ≥50 years who participated in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), conducted from 2004 to 2012, were analyzed. The outcomes of interest were performance on the cognitive domains of memory, executive function, and temporal orientation as well as the global cognition score. Cognitive performance was standardized in z-scores in strata based on schooling and age. The participants were classified as without diabetes, with controlled glycemia and with uncontrolled glycemia, according to medical diagnosis, glucose-lowering medications use and HbA1c levels. Generalized linear mixed models controlled by sociodemographic, behavioral, and health-related characteristics were used for the trajectory analyses. No differences in z-scores were found for global cognition or cognitive domains based on diabetes classification in men and women at baseline. Over eight years of follow-up, women with uncontrolled glycemia had a greater decline in z-scores for global cognition (-0.037 SD/year [95%CI: -0.073; -0.001]) and executive function (-0.049 SD/year [95%CI: -0.092; -0.007]) compared to those without diabetes.

"α-Glucosidase inhibitory potential of <i>Oroxylum indicum</i> using molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and <i>in vitro</i> evaluation.","According to the International Diabetes Federation, there will be 578 million individuals worldwide with diabetes by 2030 and 700 million by 2045. One of the promising drug targets to fight diabetes is α-glucosidase (AG), and its inhibitors may be used to manage diabetes by reducing the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simple sugars. The study aims to identify and validate potential AG inhibitors in natural sources to combat diabetes. Computational techniques such as structure-based virtual screening and molecular dyncamic simulation were employed to predict potential AG inhibitors from compounds of <i>Oroxylum indicum</i>. Finally, in silico results were validated by <i>in vitro</i> analysis using <i>n</i>-butanol fraction of crude methanol extracts. The XP glide scores of top seven hits OI_13, OI_66, OI_16, OI_44, OI_43, OI_20, OI_78 and acarbose were -14.261, -13.475, -13.074, -13.045, -12.978, -12.659, -12.354 and -12.296 kcal/mol, respectively. These hits demonstrated excellent binding affinity towards AG, surpassing the known AG inhibitor acarbose. The MM-GBSA dG binding energies of OI_13, OI_66, and acarbose were -69.093, -62.950, and -53.055 kcal/mol, respectively. Most of the top hits were glycosides, indicating that active compounds lie in the <i>n</i>-butanol fraction of the extract. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for AG inhibition by <i>n</i>-butanol fraction was 248.1 μg/ml, and for that of pure acarbose it was 89.16 μg/ml. The predicted oral absorption rate in humans for the top seven hits was low like acarbose, which favors the use of these compounds as anti-diabetes in the small intestine. In summary, the study provides promising insights into the use of natural compounds derived from <i>O. indicum</i> as potential AG inhibitors to manage diabetes. However, further research, including clinical trials and pharmacological studies, would be necessary to validate their efficacy and safety before clinical use.",['Bhaumik S; Sarkar A; Debnath S; Debnath B; Ghosh R; Zaki MEA; Al-Hussain SA'],2024,the international diabetes Federation predicts 578 million people with diabetes by 2030. the study aims to identify and validate potential AG inhibitors in natural sources to combat diabetes.
Study on the bioactive ingredients and mechanism of Huangqi against diabetic retinopathy based on network pharmacology and experimental verification.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most well-known microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Huangqi (HQ), has been used for treating DR for a long time. However, its anti-DR active ingredients and mechanism are still unknown. Therefore, we designed this study to explore the active components and mechanism of HQ against DR via network pharmacology analysis. The ingredients of HQ, potential targets of HQ and DR were obtained from public databases. We employed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to identify core targets and pathways of HQ against DR. Finally, molecular docking and vitro experiments were applied to validate our results. A total of 34 potential targets of HQ against DR were obtained. Based on PPI network, VEGFA, PTGS2, IL6 and CCL2 were considered as core targets. GO analysis involved 692 biological processes, 21 cellular components and 35 molecular functions. KEGG enrichment analysis manifested that the anti-DR effect of HQ was mainly mediated via the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications. The molecular docking results indicated that kaempferol had higher affinity with CCL2, IL-6, VEGFA and PTGS2. The vitro experiments showed that the mRNA expressions of CCL2, IL-6, VEGFA and PTGS2 in ARPE-19 cell were differentially decreased after kaempferol treatment. This study preliminarily unveiled that the therapeutic efficacy of HQ against DR might be attributed to the reduced expression of CCL2, IL-6, VEGFA and PTGS2.",['Lin X; Bao M; Zhang X; Qirula S; Jiao C; Zhang D; Han J'],2024,HQ is one of the most well-known microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus. the anti-DR active ingredients and mechanism of HQ are still unknown. a total of 34 potential targets of HQ against DR were obtained.
Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyl transferase 14 is a novel mediator in pancreatic β-cell function and growth.,"Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyl transferase 14 (GALNT14) plays important roles in cancer progression and chemotherapy response. Here, we show that GALNT14 is highly expressed in pancreatic β cells and regulates β cell function and growth. We found that the expression level of Ganlt14 was significantly decreased in the primary islets from three rodent type-2 diabetic models. Single-Cell sequencing defined that Galnt14 was mainly expressed in β cells of mouse islets. Galnt14 knockout (G14KO) INS-1 cell line, constructed by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology were growth normal, but showed blunt shape, and increased basal insulin secretion. Combined proteomics and glycoproteomics demonstrated that G14KO altered cell-to-cell junctions, communication, and adhesion. Insulin receptor (IR) and IGF1-1R were indirectly confirmed for GALNT14 substrates, contributed to diminished IGF1-induced p-AKT levels and cell growth in G14KO cells. Overall, this study uncovers that GALNT14 is a novel modulator in regulating β cells biology, providing a missing link of β cells O-glycosylation to diabetes development.",['Shu T; Zhang Y; Sun T; Zhu Y'],2024,polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyl transferase 14 (GALNT14) plays important roles in cancer progression and chemotherapy response. the expression level of Ganlt14 was significantly decreased in the primary islets from three rodent type-2 diabetic models.
Epigenetic-related gene-based prognostic model construction and validation in prostate adenocarcinoma.,"Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), driven by both genetic and epigenetic factors, is a common malignancy that affects men worldwide. We aimed to identify and characterize differentially expressed epigenetic-related genes (ERGs) in PRAD and investigate their potential roles in disease progression and prognosis. We used PRAD samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify prognosis-associated ERGs. Thirteen ERGs with two distinct expression profiles were identified through consensus clustering. Gene set variation analysis highlighted differences in pathway activities, particularly in the Hedgehog and Notch pathways. Higher epigenetic scores correlated with favorable prognosis and improved immunotherapeutic response. Experimental validation underscored the importance of CBX3 and KAT2A, suggesting their pivotal roles in PRAD. This study provides crucial insights into the epigenetic scoring approach and presents a promising prognostic tool, with CBX3 and KAT2A as key players.

Metabolomic biomarkers for benign conditions and malignant ovarian cancer: Advancing early diagnosis.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is a major global cause of death among gynecological cancers, with a high mortality rate. Early diagnosis, distinguishing between benign conditions and early malignant OC forms, is vital for successful treatment. This research investigates serum metabolites to find diagnostic biomarkers for early OC identification. Metabolomic profiles derived from the serum of 60 patients with benign conditions and 60 patients with malignant OC were examined using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Comparative analysis revealed differential metabolites linked to OC, aiding biomarker identification for early-diagnosis of OC via machine learning features. The predictive ability of these biomarkers was evaluated against the traditional biomarker, cancer antigen 125 (CA125). 84 differential metabolites were identified, including 2-Thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA), Methionyl-Cysteine, and Citrulline that could serve as potential biomarkers to identify benign conditions and malignant OC. In the diagnosis of early-stage OC, the area under the curve (AUC) for Citrulline was 0.847 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 0.719-0.974), compared to 0.770 (95 % CI: 0.596-0.944) for TTCA, and 0.754 for Methionine-Cysteine (95 % CI: 0.589-0.919). These metabolites demonstrate a superior diagnostic capability relative to CA125, which has an AUC of 0.689 (95 % CI: 0.448-0.931). Among these biomarkers, Citrulline stands out as the most promising. Additionally, in the diagnosis of benign conditions and malignant OC, using logistic regression to combine potential biomarkers with CA125 has an AUC of 0.987 (95 % CI: 0.9708-1) has been proven to be more effective than relying solely on the traditional biomarker CA125 with an AUC of 0.933 (95 % CI: 0.870-0.996). Furthermore, among all the differential metabolites, lipid metabolites dominate, significantly impacting glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. The discovered serum metabolite biomarkers demonstrate excellent diagnostic performance for distinguishing between benign conditions and malignant OC and for early diagnosis of malignant OC.",['Zhang W; Lai Z; Liang X; Yuan Z; Yuan Y; Wang Z; Peng P; Xia L; Yang X; Li Z'],2024,"84 differential metabolites were identified, including 2-Thiothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (TTCA), Methionyl-Cysteine, and Citrulline. the area under the curve for Citrulline was 0.770 (95 % CI: 0.796-0.944) for TTCA, and 0.770 (95 % CI: 0.596-0.944) for TTCA."
Identification of co-expressed central genes and transcription factors in acute myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy.,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) are common clinical co-morbidities, but they are challenging to manage and have poor prognoses. There is no research on the bioinformatics mechanisms of comorbidity, and this study aims to investigate such mechanisms. We downloaded the AMI data (GSE66360) and DN datasets (GSE30528 and GSE30529) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) platform. The GSE66360 dataset was divided into two parts: the training set and the validation set, and GSE30529 was used as the training set and GSE30528 as the validation set. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AMI and DN in the training set, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction were performed. A sub-network graph was constructed by MCODE, and 15 hub genes were screened by the Cytohubba plugin. The screened hub genes were validated, and the 15 screened hub genes were subjected to GO, KEGG, Gene MANIA analysis, and transcription factor (TF) prediction. Finally, we performed TF differential analysis, enrichment analysis, and TF and gene regulatory network construction. A total of 46 genes (43 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated) were identified for subsequent analysis. GO functional analysis emphasized the presence of genes mainly in the vesicle membrane and secretory granule membrane involved in antigen processing and presentation, lipopeptide binding, NAD + nucleosidase activity, and Toll-like receptor binding. The KEGG pathways analyzed were mainly in the phagosome, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, apoptosis, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Eight co-expressed hub genes were identified and validated, namely TLR2, FCER1G, CD163, CTSS, CLEC4A, IGSF6, NCF2, and MS4A6A. Three transcription factors were identified and validated in AMI, namely NFKB1, HIF1A, and SPI1. Our study reveals the common pathogenesis of AMI and DN.

The causal relationship between sarcopenia-related traits and ischemic stroke: Insights from univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses.,"The causal relationship between sarcopenia-related traits and ischemic stroke (IS) remains poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the causal impact of sarcopenia-related traits on IS and to identify key mediators of this association. We conducted univariable, multivariable two-sample, and two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. This included data for appendicular lean mass (ALM), hand grip strength (HGS), and usual walking pace (UWP) from the UK Biobank, and IS data from the MEGASTROKE consortium. Additionally, 21 candidate mediators were analyzed based on their respective GWAS data sets. Each 1-SD increase in genetically proxied ALM was associated with a 7.5% reduction in the risk of IS (95% CI: 0.879-0.974), and this correlation remained after controlling for levels of physical activity and adiposity-related indices. Two-step MR identified that six mediators partially mediated the protective effect of higher ALM on IS, with the most significant being coronary heart disease (CHD, mediating proportion: 39.94%), followed by systolic blood pressure (36.51%), hypertension (23.87%), diastolic blood pressure (15.39%), type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, 12.71%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (7.97%). Our study revealed a causal protective effect of higher ALM on IS, independent of physical activity and adiposity-related indices. Moreover, we found that higher ALM could reduce susceptibility to IS partially by lowering the risk of vascular risk factors, including CHD, hypertension, T2DM, and hyperlipidemia. In brief, we elucidated another modifiable factor for IS and implied that maintaining sufficient muscle mass may reduce the risk of such disease.",['Song J; Zhou D; Li J; Wang M; Jia L; Lan D; Song H; Ji X; Meng R'],2024,sarcopenia-related traits and ischemic stroke (IS) remain poorly understood.

An effective urobilin clearance strategy based on paramagnetic beads facilitates microscale proteomic analysis of urine.,"Urine provides an ideal source for disease biomarker discovery. High-adhesion contaminants such as urobilin, which are difficult to remove from urine, can severely interfere with urinary proteomic analysis. Here, we aimed to establish a strategy based on single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) technology to prepare samples for urinary proteomics analysis that almost completely eliminates the impact of urobilin. A systematic evaluation of the effects of two urinary protein precipitation methods, two types of protein lysis buffers, and different ratios of magnetic digestion beads on the identification and quantification of the microscale urinary proteome was conducted. Our results indicate that methanol-chloroform precipitation, coupled with efficient lysis facilitated by urea, and subsequent enzymatic digestion using a mix of hydrophilic and hydrophobic magnetic beads offers the best performance. Further applying this strategy to the urine of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer and healthy individuals, combined with a narrow window of data-independent acquisition, FGFR4, MYLK, ORM2, GOLM1, SPP1, CD55, CSF1, DLD and TIMP3 were identified as potential biomarkers to discriminate benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer patients.",['Zhen K; Hou W; Bai L; Wang M; Yue Z; Xu Z; Xiong D; Gao L; Ying W'],2024,urobilin can interfere with urinary proteomics analysis. a systematic evaluation of the effects of two urinary protein precipitation methods. methanol-chloroform precipitation coupled with efficient lysis facilitated by urea offers the best performance.

"Extended dosing (12 cycles) vs conventional dosing (6 cycles) of adjuvant temozolomide in adults with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas: a randomized, single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group controlled trial.","Maximum safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiation and temozolomide chemotherapy is the current standard of care in the management of newly diagnosed high grade glioma. However, there are controversies about the optimal number of adjuvant temozolomide cycles. This study aimed to compare the survival benefits of 12 cycles against 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide adults with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas. Adult patients with newly diagnosed high grade gliomas, and a Karnofsky performance status>60%, were randomized to receive either 6 cycles or 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Patients were followed-up for assessment of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) by brain MRI every 3 months within the first year after treatment and then every six months. A total of 100 patients (6 cycles, 50; 12 cycles, 50) were entered. The rate of treatment completion in 6 cycles and 12 cycles groups were 91.3% and 55.1%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 26 months, the 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-month OS rates in 6 cycles and 12 cycles groups were 81.3% vs 78.8%, 58.3% vs 49.8%, 47.6% vs 34.1%, and 47.6% vs 31.5%, respectively (p-value=.19). Median OS of 6 cycles and 12 cycles groups were 35 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 11.0 to 58.9) and 23 months (95%CI, 16.9 to 29.0). The 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48- month PFS rates in 6 cycles and 12 cycles groups were 70.8% vs 56.9%, 39.5% and 32.7%, 27.1% vs 28.8%, and 21.1% vs 28.8%, respectively (p=.88). The Median PFS of 6 cycles and 12 cycles groups was 18 months (95% CI, 14.8 to 21.1) and 16 (95% CI, 11.0 to 20.9) months.

Novel strategy: Identifying new markers for demyelination in diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.,"To develop a novel strategy for identifying acquired demyelination in diabetic distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSP). Motor nerve conduction velocity (CV) slowing in diabetic DSP exceeds expectations for pure axonal loss thus implicating superimposed acquired demyelination. After establishing demyelination confidence intervals by regression analysis of nerve conduction data from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), we prospectively studied CV slowing in 90 diabetic DSP patients with and without at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing (groups A and B) into the demyelination range by American Academy of Neurology (AAN) criteria respectively and 95 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Simultaneously, secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity was assessed in both diabetic groups and 46 healthy controls. No ALS patient exhibited CV slowing in more than two motor nerves based on AAN criteria or the confidence intervals. Group A demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of patients as compared to group B fulfilling the above criteria, with an additional criterion of at least one motor nerve exhibiting CV slowing in the demyelinating range and a corresponding F response in the demyelinating range by AAN criteria (70.3 % <i>vs.</i> 1.9 %; p < 0.0001). Urine sPLA2 activity was increased significantly in diabetic groups as compared to healthy controls (942.9 ± 978.0 <i>vs.</i> 591.6 ± 390.2 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.05), and in group A compared to Group B (1328.3 ± 1274.2 <i>vs.</i> 673.8 ± 576.9 pmol/min/ml, p < 0.01). More patients with elevated sPLA2 activity and more than 2 motor nerves with CV slowing in the AAN or the confidence intervals were identified in group A as compared to group B (35.1 % <i>vs.</i> 5.7 %, p < 0.001). Furthermore, 13.5 % of patients in diabetic DSP Group A, and no patients in diabetic DSP Group B, fulfilled an additional criterion of more than one motor nerve with CV slowing into the demyelinating range with its corresponding F response into the demyelinating range by AAN criteria.

A structured iterative division approach for non-sparse regression models and applications in biological data analysis.,"In this paper, we focus on the modeling problem of estimating data with non-sparse structures, specifically focusing on biological data that exhibit a high degree of relevant features. Various fields, such as biology and finance, face the challenge of non-sparse estimation. We address the problems using the proposed method, called structured iterative division. Structured iterative division effectively divides data into non-sparse and sparse structures and eliminates numerous irrelevant variables, significantly reducing the error while maintaining computational efficiency. Numerical and theoretical results demonstrate the competitive advantage of the proposed method on a wide range of problems, and the proposed method exhibits excellent statistical performance in numerical comparisons with several existing methods. We apply the proposed algorithm to two biology problems, gene microarray datasets, and chimeric protein datasets, to the prognostic risk of distant metastasis in breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Structured iterative division provides insights into gene identification and selection, and we also provide meaningful results in anticipating cancer risk and identifying key factors.",['Yu S; Yang Y'],2024,structured iterative division effectively divides data into non-sparse and sparse structures. structured iterative division effectively divides data into non-sparse and sparse structures.
"Flavonoids with lipase inhibitory activity from lemon squeezing waste: isolation, multispectroscopic and in silico studies.","Obesity is recognized as a lifestyle-related disease and the main risk factor for a series of pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Citrus limon is an important medicinal plant, and its fruits are rich in flavonoids investigated for their potential in managing obesity. In the present work, a green extraction applied to lemon squeezing waste (LSW) was optimized to recover pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitors. The microwave-assisted procedure yielded an extract with higher lipase inhibitory activity than those obtained by maceration and ultrasound. The main compounds present in the extract were identified by high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis, and hesperidin, eriocitrin and 4'-methyllucenin II were isolated. The three compounds were evaluated for in vitro PL inhibitory activity, and 4'-methyllucenin II resulted in the most promising inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 12.1 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>; K<sub>i</sub> = 62.2 μmol L<sup>-1</sup>). Multispectroscopic approaches suggested the three flavonoids act as competitive inhibitors and the binding studies indicated a greater interaction between PL and 4'-methyllucenin II. Docking analysis indicated the significant interactions of the three flavonoids with the PL catalytic site. The present work highlights flavonoid glycosides as promising PL inhibitors and proposes LSW as a safe ingredient for the preparation of food supplements for managing obesity. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",['Cardullo N; Calcagno D; Pulvirenti L; Sciacca C; Pittalà MGG; Maccarronello AE; Thevenard F; Muccilli V'],2024,"citrus limon is an important medicinal plant, and its fruits are rich in flavonoids investigated for their potential in managing obesity. the extract was optimized to recover pancreatic lipase inhibitors. the main compounds present in the extract were identified by high-performance liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis."
Specific differences and novel key regulatory genes of sex in influencing exceptional longevity phenotypes.,"Although the life expectancy of women systematically and robustly exceeds that of men, specific differences and molecular mechanisms of sex in influencing longevity phenotypes remain largely unknown. Therefore, we performed transcriptome sequencing of peripheral blood samples to explore regulatory mechanisms of healthy longevity by incorporating sex data. We selected 34 exceptional longevity (age: 98.26 ± 2.45 years) and 16 controls (age: 52.81 ± 9.78) without advanced outcomes from 1363 longevity and 692 controls recruited from Nanning of Guangxi for RNA sequencing 1. The transcriptome sequencing 1 data of 50 samples were compared by longevity and sex to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, 121 aging samples (40-110 years old) without advanced outcomes from 355 longevity and 294 controls recruited from Dongxing of Guangxi were selected for RNA sequencing 2. The genes associated with aging from the transcriptome sequencing 2 of 121 aging samples were filtered out. Finally, the gender-related longevity candidate genes and their possible metabolic pathways were verified by cell model of aging and a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Metabolism differs between male and female and plays a key role in longevity. Moreover, the principal findings of this study revealed a novel key gene, UGT2B11, that plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism through the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG) signalling pathway and ultimately improving lifespan, particularly in females. The findings suggest specific differences in metabolism affecting exceptional longevity phenotypes between the sexes and offer novel therapeutic targets to extend lifespan by regulating lipid homeostasis.",['Ni X; Su H; Li GH; Li R; Lan R; Lv Y; Pang G; Zhang W; Yang Z; Hu C'],2024,transcriptome sequencing of peripheral blood samples was performed. the results were compared by longevity and sex to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) the genes associated with aging from the transcriptome sequencing 2 of 121 aging samples were filtered out.
Competing endogenous RNA networks and ferroptosis in cancer: novel therapeutic targets.,"As a newly identified regulated cell death, ferroptosis is a metabolically driven process that relies on iron and is associated with polyunsaturated fatty acyl peroxidation, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial damage. This distinct regulated cell death is dysregulated in various cancers; activating ferroptosis in malignant cells increases cancer immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy responses across different malignancies. Over the last decade, accumulating research has provided evidence of cross-talk between non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks and highlighted their significance in developing and progressing malignancies. Aside from pharmaceutical agents to regulate ferroptosis, recent studies have shed light on the potential of restoring dysregulated ferroptosis-related ceRNA networks in cancer treatment. The present study provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the ferroptosis significance, ferroptosis pathways, the role of ferroptosis in cancer immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, ceRNA biogenesis, and ferroptosis-regulating ceRNA networks in different cancers. The provided insights can offer the authorship with state-of-the-art findings and future perspectives regarding the ferroptosis and ferroptosis-related ceRNA networks and their implication in the treatment and determining the prognosis of affected patients.",['Nejadi Orang F; Abdoli Shadbad M'],2024,ferroptosis is a metabolically driven process that relies on iron. activating ferroptosis in malignant cells increases cancer immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy responses across different malignancies. recent studies shed light on the potential of restoring dysregulated ferroptosis-related ceRNA networks in cancer treatment.
Hemorrhage Sites and Mitigation Strategies After Pancreaticoduodenectomy.,"Postpancreatectomy hemorrhage is an uncommon but highly morbid complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy. Clinical evidence often draws suspicion to the gastroduodenal artery stump, even without a clear source. To determine the frequency of gastroduodenal artery bleeding compared to other sites and the results of mitigation strategies. This cohort study involved a retrospective analysis of data for consecutive patients who had pancreaticoduodenectomy from 2011 to 2021 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH). Demographic, perioperative, and disease-related variables. The incidence, location, treatment, and outcomes of primary (initial) and secondary (recurrent) hemorrhage requiring invasive intervention were analyzed. Imaging studies were re-reviewed by interventional radiologists to confirm sites. Inclusion criteria were met by 3040 patients (n = 1761 MSK, n = 1279 TJUH). Patients from both institutions were similar in age (median [IQR] age at MSK, 67 [59-74] years, and at TJUH, 68 [60-75] years) and sex (at MSK, 814 female [46.5%] and 947 male [53.8%], and at TJUH, 623 [48.7%] and 623 male [51.3%]). Primary hemorrhage occurred in 90 patients (3.0%), of which the gastroduodenal artery was the source in 15 (16.7%), unidentified sites in 24 (26.7%), and non-gastroduodenal artery sites in 51 (56.7%). Secondary hemorrhage occurred in 23 patients; in 4 (17.4%), the gastroduodenal artery was the source. Of all hemorrhage events (n = 117), the gastroduodenal artery was the source in 19 (16.2%, 0.63% incidence in all pancreaticoduodenectomies). Gastroduodenal artery hemorrhage was more often associated with soft gland texture (14 [93.3%] vs 41 [62.1%]; P = .02) and later presentation (median [IQR], 21 [15-26] vs 10 days [5-18]; P = .002). Twenty-three patients underwent empirical gastroduodenal artery embolization or stent placement, 7 (30.4%) of whom subsequently experienced secondary hemorrhage. Twenty percent of all gastroduodenal artery embolizations/stents (8/40 patients), including 13% (3/13 patients) of empirical treatments, were associated with significant morbidity (7 hepatic infarction, 4 biliary stricture), with a 90-day mortality rate of 38.5% (n = 5) for patients with these complications vs 7.8% without (n = 6; P = .008). Ninety-day mortality was 12.2% (n = 11) for patients with hemorrhage (3 patients [20%] with primary gastroduodenal vs 8 [10.7%] for all others; P = .38) compared with 2% (n = 59) for patients without hemorrhage. In this study, postpancreatectomy hemorrhage was uncommon and the spectrum was broad, with the gastroduodenal artery responsible for a minority of bleeding events. Empirical gastroduodenal artery embolization/stent without obvious sequelae of recent hemorrhage was associated with significant morbidity and rebleeding and should not be routine practice. Successful treatment of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage requires careful assessment of all potential sources, even after gastroduodenal artery mitigation.","[""Preston WA; Collins ML; Gönen M; Murtha T; Rivera V; Lamm R; Schafer M; Yarmohammadi H; Covey A; Brody LA; Topper S; Nevler A; Lavu H; Yeo CJ; Balachandran VP; Drebin JA; Soares KC; Wei AC; Kingham TP; D'Angelica MI; Jarnagin WR""]",2024,postpancreaticoduodenectomy hemorrhage is an uncommon but highly morbid complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy. clinical evidence often draws suspicion to the gastroduodenal artery stump.
Association of preoperative workup and comorbidities with risk of gastroesophageal surgery failure.,"While surgical failure rates for fundoplication and hiatal hernia repair are low, there has been no clear evaluation of the preoperative risk factors associated with surgical failure. This study aimed to identify risk factors predisposing patients to surgical failure. Patients who underwent antireflux surgery during a 3-year period were evaluated for evidence of surgical complications and placed accordingly into the failure or control group. Demographic data, comorbidities, clinical presentation, preoperative evaluation, and surgical data were collected and compared between the groups. In total, 86 patients with failure and 42 controls were identified among our cohort. No significant differences were found between groups based on sex (P=0.640). However, patients with failure were younger than controls (57.0 vs. 64.7 years, P=0.0001). Body mass index, tobacco use and alcohol use did not differ significantly between the groups (P=0.189, P=0.0999, P=0.060). Notably, psychiatric illness was more common in the failure group (P=0.0086). Neither hypertension (P=0.134) nor diabetes (P=0.335) had significant differences between groups. For procedures, no significant differences were found for the frequencies of preoperative imaging (P=0.395) or manometry (P=0.374), but pH/BRAVO studies (P=0.0193) and endoscopy (P<0.001) were both performed more frequently in the failure group. Patients with psychiatric comorbidities are at higher risk of surgical failure. Alcohol use trended toward significance, which warrants further investigation. We also noted an increase in rates of preoperative pH and endoscopy studies, contrary to the prior literature; this is likely due to more complex cases requiring additional workup.",['Ventura F; Gawdi R; German Z; Patel A; Westcott C; Clayton S'],2024,"patients who underwent antireflux surgery during a 3-year period were evaluated for evidence of surgical complications. no significant differences were found between groups based on sex (P=0.640) patients with failure were younger than controls (57.0 vs. 64.7 years, P=0.0001)"
Impact of patient information format on the experience of cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.,"Radiotherapy (RT) stands as one of the main cancer treatments. The impact of RT and cancer treatment can have a physical and psychological impact on patients and their carers. To gain patient's trust, and ensure they feel valued, information should be provided before, during, and after RT. Patient and public involvement (PPI) has been lacking, and increased engagement with PPI groups could improve this. This rapid review aims to analyse the literature, and describe and report patient perception, experience, and satisfaction regarding the information received concerning their course of RT. To allow the synthesis of results, a pragmatic decision was made to use a rapid review approach to analyse the literature, providing more timely information to inform future work. This rapid review utilised systematic review methods and was conducted according to a pre-defined protocol including clear inclusion criteria (PROSPERO registration: CRD42023415916).Electronic databases CINAHL, AMED, Pubmed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were searched using a comprehensive search for published studies from January 2012 to November 2023. Two independent reviewers applied the eligibility criteria. Evidence from literature was extracted and transcribed into qualitative data and Braun and Clarke's six-step thematic analysis (TA) was employed to determine themes by one reviewer and checked by a second [26]. Due to the heterogeneity of the included literature, the analysis of this review is presented primarily through narrative synthesis. Sixty eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Emerging themes included; a desire for information based on patient characteristics, information format, patient preparedness, timing e.g. timing of information and changing priorities over time, health care professional (HCP) involvement, barriers to information, and motivators for better information delivery. Several factors can influence a patient's desire for information, from whom and when they receive it, to what format they would prefer to receive it. There is benefit to be gained in employing PPI and patient advocacy to inform future studies that aim to further understand the themes that emerged from this review. Such studies can therefore inform HCPs in providing patient-specific information and support by utilising multiple teaching strategies available to them.",['Corish S; Fulton BA; Galbraith L; Coltart K; Duffton A'],2024,"RT and cancer treatment can have a physical and psychological impact on patients and their carers. rapid review aims to analyse literature, describe and report patient perception, experience, and satisfaction. a rapid review utilised systematic review methods and was conducted according to a pre-defined protocol including clear inclusion criteria."
Transcriptomics reveals transient and dynamic muscle fibrosis and atrophy differences following spinal cord injury in rats.,"The rate and magnitude of skeletal muscle wasting after severe spinal cord injury (SCI) exceeds most other disuse conditions. Assessing the time course of molecular changes can provide insight into the progression of muscle wasting post-SCI. The goals of this study were (1) to identify potential targets that may prevent the pathologic features of SCI in soleus muscles and (2) to establish therapeutic windows for treating these pathologic changes. Four-month-old Sprague-Dawley male rats received T9 laminectomy (SHAM surgery) or severe contusion SCI. Hindlimb locomotor function was assessed weekly, with soleus muscles obtained 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months post-surgery (n = 6-7 per group per timepoint). RNA was extracted from muscles for bulk RNA-sequencing analysis (n = 3-5 per group per timepoint). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were evaluated between age-matched SHAM and SCI animals. Myofiber size, muscle fibre type and fibrosis were assessed on contralateral muscles. SCI produced immediate and persistent hindlimb paralysis, with Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor scores remaining below 7 throughout the study, contributing to a progressive 25-50% lower soleus mass and myofiber atrophy versus SHAM (P < 0.05 at all timepoints). Transcriptional comparisons of SCI versus SHAM resulted in 184 DEGs (1 week), 436 DEGs (2 weeks), 133 DEGs (1 month) and 1200 DEGs (3 months). Upregulated atrophy-related genes included those associated with cell senescence, nuclear factor kappa B, ubiquitin proteasome and unfolded protein response pathways, along with upregulated genes that negatively influence muscle growth through the transforming growth factor beta pathway and inhibition of insulin-like growth factor-I/Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin and p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling. Genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM), including collagens, collagen crosslinkers, proteoglycans and those regulating ECM integrity, were enriched within upregulated DEGs at 1 week but subsequently downregulated at 2 weeks and 3 months and were accompanied by >50% higher ECM areas and hydroxyproline levels in SCI muscles (P < 0.05). Myofiber remodelling genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 2 weeks and 1 month and were downregulated at 3 months. Genes that regulate neuromuscular junction remodelling were evident in muscles post-SCI, along with slow-to-fast fibre-type shifts: 1 week and 2 weeks SCI muscles were composed of 90% myosin heavy chain (MHC) type I fibres, which decreased to only 16% at 3 months and were accompanied by 50% fibres containing MHC IIX (P < 0.05). Metabolism genes were enriched in upregulated DEGs at 1 month and were further enriched at 3 months. Our results substantiate many known pathologic features of SCI-induced wasting in rat skeletal muscle and identify a progressive and dynamic transcriptional landscape within the post-SCI soleus. Future studies are warranted to consider these therapeutic treatment windows when countering SCI muscle pathology.",['Kok HJ; Fletcher DB; Oster JC; Conover CF; Barton ER; Yarrow JF'],2024,skeletal muscle wasting after severe spinal cord injury exceeds most other disuse conditions. a study found that a skeletal muscle wasting post-SCI is a major factor.
Assessment of the hematological profiles among COVID-19 patients during the first and second waves in Ethiopia: A multicenter retrospective cohort study.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 is highly infectious and patients with coronavirus diseases demonstrated a series of clinical symptoms caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Without a break of the wave's hematological profile of the patients is still ambiguous and differs from wave to wave. This study aimed to assess the hematological profile among coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the first and the second waves in Ethiopia. A multi-centered facility-based retrospective cohort study design was conducted at six coronavirus disease 2019 treatment centers. A total of 538 study participants were enrolled in the selected coronavirus disease 2019 treatment centers during the first and second waves of the pandemic. The demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, symptoms, and hematological parameters of patients were recorded. Data were entered into Epi-Data Manager 4.6 and analyzed using STATA 14.2. An independent sample <i>t</i>-test was used to assess the mean differences in hematological parameters across waves. Associations between categorical variables across waves were also determined using Chi-square and Fisher exact tests. Among the total study participants, 240 (44.6%) and 298 (55.4%) patients were taken from wave-1 and wave-2, respectively. The average age of the study participants was 56.44 ± 16.25 years. The most frequent comorbidities in this study were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and asthma. The most presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection across the two waves were presented. In the first wave, dry cough 166 (69.2%), fatigue 153 (63.75%), shortness of breath 148 (61.67%), and fever accounted 116 (48.33%), while during the second wave, dry cough 242 (81.2%), fatigue 244 (81.88%) shortness of breath 204 (68.47%) and fever account 180 (60.40%). White blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, and lymphocytes had shown increment during the first wave.

Biotin labeling allows for post-transfusion functional assessment of stored human platelets in mice.,"Platelet radiolabeling with radioisotopes is currently used for human platelet recovery and survival studies. Biotinylation enables ex vivo post-transfusion platelet function testing. Whether platelet biotinylation itself affects platelet function is controversial. Platelet concentrates from healthy humans were stored for 6 days. Samples were obtained at 1 or 2 and 6 days, and platelets were labeled following a radiolabeling protocol using saline instead of radioactive indium-111 (sham radiolabeling [sham-RL]). Alternatively, a newly developed biotinylation protocol, a washing protocol, or an unmanipulated control sample were used. Platelet function was assessed by flow cytometry after stimulation with platelet agonists and labeling of platelets with platelet activation markers. To test whether platelets can be activated after transfusion, labeled platelets were transfused into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice, and samples were obtained 1 h after transfusion. The activation profile of biotinylated platelets was comparable to sham-RL platelets before transfusion except for significantly less α-degranulation and more phosphatidyl serine exposure on storage day 1/2. There was no significant difference between sham-RL and biotinylated platelets on storage day 6. Sham-RL and biotinylated platelets were significantly less activatable than washed and unmanipulated control platelets. After transfusion, the activation profile of biotinylated platelets was largely indistinguishable from unmanipulated ones. The decrease in activation level in biotinylated platelets we and others observed appears mainly due to the physical manipulation during the labeling process. In conclusion, biotinylated platelets allow for post-transfusion function assessment, a major advantage over radiolabeling.",['Bailey SL; Bochenek M; Chauhan A; Miller B; Stolla M'],2024,platelet radiolabeling with radioisotopes is currently used for human platelet recovery and survival studies. biotinylation enables ex vivo post-transfusion platelet function testing.
Recommendations on self-management interventions for adults living with obesity: COMPAR-EU project.,"Self-management interventions (SMIs) may improve disease management in adults living with obesity. We formulated evidence-based recommendations for SMIs within the context of the COMPAR-EU project. The multidisciplinary panel selected critical outcomes based on the COMPAR-EU core outcome set and established decision thresholds for each outcome. Recommendations were informed by systematic reviews of effects, cost-effectiveness, and a contextual assessment. To assess the certainty of the evidence and formulate the recommendations, we used the GRADE approach guidance. Overall, SMIs were deemed to have a small impact, but the absence of harmful effects and potential cumulative benefits indicated a favourable balance of effects, despite low certainty. SMIs showed variations in structure, intensity, and resource utilisation, but overall are likely to be cost-effective. Adapting SMIs to local contexts would enhance equity, acceptability, and feasibility, considering patients' values, and availability of resources and teamwork. Consequently, the panel made conditional recommendations favouring SMIs over usual care. The rigorous and explicit recommendations demonstrated the effectiveness of SMIs for adults living with obesity. However, the gaps in the literature influenced the panel to make only conditional recommendations in favour of SMIs. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence base and improve recommendations' certainty and applicability.",['Medina-Aedo M; Beltran J; Valli C; Canelo-Aybar C; Song Y; Ballester M; Bowman-Busato J; Christogiannis C; Grammatikopoulou MG; Groene O; Heijmans M; Hoogendorn M; Killeen SL; Kontouli KM; Mavridis D; Miñambres I; Mueller BS; Niño de Guzman E; Noordman J; Orrego C; Perestelo-Perez L; Saz-Parkinson Z; Seitidis G; Suñol R; Tsokani S; Alonso-Coello P'],2024,"multidisciplinary panel selected critical outcomes based on the COMPAR-EU core outcome set. based on the COMPAR-EU core outcome set, we used the GRADE approach guidance."
Design of randomized clinical trials with a binary endpoint: Conditional versus unconditional analyses of a two-by-two table.,"When designing a randomized clinical trial to compare two treatments, the sample size required to have desired power with a specified type 1 error depends on the hypothesis testing procedure. With a binary endpoint (e.g., response), the trial results can be displayed in a 2 × 2 table. If one does the analysis conditional on the number of positive responses, then using Fisher's exact test has an actual type 1 error less than or equal to the specified nominal type 1 error. Alternatively, one can use one of many unconditional ""exact"" tests that also preserve the type 1 error and are less conservative than Fisher's exact test. In particular, the unconditional test of Boschloo is always at least as powerful as Fisher's exact test, leading to smaller required sample sizes for clinical trials. However, many statisticians have argued over the years that the conditional analysis with Fisher's exact test is the only appropriate procedure. Since having smaller clinical trials is an extremely important consideration, we review the general arguments given for the conditional analysis of a 2 × 2 table in the context of a randomized clinical trial. We find the arguments not relevant in this context, or, if relevant, not completely convincing, suggesting the sample-size advantage of the unconditional tests should lead to their recommended use. We also briefly suggest that since designers of clinical trials practically always have target null and alternative response rates, there is the possibility of using this information to improve the power of the unconditional tests.",['Korn EL; Freidlin B'],2024,a randomized clinical trial can be designed to compare two treatments. the sample size required to have desired power with a specified type 1 error depends on the hypothesis testing procedure. the unconditional test of Boschloo is always at least as powerful as Fisher's exact test.
[Clinical characteristics and prognosis of five children with maturity onset of diabetes of the young 12 subtype].,"<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the genetic and clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of patients diagnosed with maturity onset of diabetes of the young (MODY) 12 subtype. <b>Methods:</b> This retrospective study collected and analyzed data from 5 children with MODY12 subtype caused by ABCC8 gene variants who underwent inpatient and outpatient genetic testing at Beijing Children's Hospital from January 2016 to December 2023. Their clinical and genetic features, treatment, and follow-up results were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 5 patients with MODY12 subtype, 4 were male and 1 was female, with an age of 13.4 (5.5, 14.6) years. Four of the patients were born large for gestational age, while one was born small for gestational age. Two patients were overweight or obese. Three patients exhibited typical symptoms of diabetes, while 2 were incidentally found to have elevated blood glucose level. One patient was found to have diabetic ketoacidosis at onset, who was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinism during the neonatal period and received diazoxide treatment, and experienced intellectual developmental delay. All 5 patients had autosomal dominant inherited diabetes within 3 generations. The fasting blood glucose at onset was 7.5 (6.5, 10.0) mmol/L, the haemoglobin, A1c (HbA1c) was 11.8% (7.5%, 13.5%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.2 (1.1, 2.2)μg/L. The duration of follow-up was 15 (9, 32) months. One patient underwent lifestyle intervention, two received metformin orally, one received insulin therapy, and the other received subcutaneous injection of insulin combined with sulfonylurea orally. At the last follow-up, the median fasting blood glucose was 6.1 (5.1, 7.0) mmol/L, the HbA1c was 5.9% (5.7%, 7.1%), and the fasting C-peptide was 1.7 (0.9, 2.9)μg/L. One patient developed diabetic retinopathy. There were 4 missense variations in ABCC8 gene and one in-frame deletion, all of which were maternally inherited heterozygotes. <b>Conclusions:</b> MODY12 subtype is a heterogeneous disorder with the age of onset from infancy to adolescence.

Landscape of esophageal cancer in Northern Kenya: experience from Garissa Regional Cancer Center.,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is the ninth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. More than 80% of cases and deaths from EC occur within developing countries. In Kenya, cancer is the second leading cause of non-communicable disease deaths, and the trend of cancer deaths is projected to increase as per the 2020 GLOBOCAN report showing 42,116 new cases annually with a mortality of 27,092 cases. EC is the leading cancer in men and the third most common in women in Kenya. The Garissa Regional Cancer Center (GRCC) is one of the three regional cancer centres in Kenya. Despite the rising EC incidence in the region, there is limited data about the clinicopathological features and treatment outcomes of EC, therefore, this is the first study to look at the landscape of EC in the northern Kenya region. This was a retrospective study involving patients' file review of confirmed EC cases diagnosed or treated at the GRCC from 2019 to 2023. Data collected from each patient's chart included age, sex, risk factors, family history of EC, histological type, stage at diagnosis, treatment type and survival outcomes. For patients who were no longer in contact with the staff through clinic visits, the patients or their next of kin were contacted through phone calls for patients' survival status. Data were collected and stored using the STATA software. Over the study period, 124 esophageal cases were identified, 64 (51.4%) were males and 60 (48.4%) were females with a mean age of 57.56 years. In terms of risk factors, hot beverage consumption was the highest (47 cases, 37.9%), followed by history of peptic ulcer disease (27 cases, 21.8%), smoking (8.9%) and gastresophageal reflux disease (2 cases, 1.6%). Stage of diagnosis at presentation was stage 1 (1 case, 0.8%), stage 2 (22 cases, 17.8%), stage 3 (25 cases, 20.2%), stage 4 (50 cases, 40.3%), not staged (26 cases, 21%). The majority had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (105 cases, 84.7%), followed by adenocarcinoma (5 cases, 4%), anaplastic (5 cases, 4%), SCC+ adenocarcinoma (1 case, 0.8%), unknown histology (8 cases, 3.2%). Nearly all patients had triple assessment (Endoscopy, histology and staging scans) accounting for 92 cases (74.2%), 24 cases (20%) had endoscopy+ histology only, and 8 cases (3.2%) had only imaging scans. In terms of family history of EC, 20 cases (16.1%) had a family history of EC.Most of the patients were of ethnic Kenyan-Somali background (108 cases, Kenyan Somali, 87.1%) and majority were from Garissa County 96 cases (77.4%), 12 cases (9.7%) Wajir County, 12 cases (9.7%) from Tana River County and 4 cases (3.2%) from other counties. Many patients lacked health insurance (27 cases, 25.8%), while the majority paid out of pocket (92 cases,74.1%). Only 21% (26 cases) received chemotherapy alone, 5 cases (4%) got radiotherapy alone, 12.9% (16 cases) got chemoradiotherapy and a significant number of patients (77 cases, 62.1%) did not receive hospital-based cancer treatment. This study is the first esophageal study at the GRCC and in northern Kenya in general. Our study confirmed the clinicopathological features of one of the most common cancers in Kenya and more so among Kenyan-Somalis.The study also validates the predominance of histological subtypes of esophageal SCC with the late presentation, short survival and significant loss of follow-up. We recommend future EC studies employing a large prospective design with a large sample size to determine the impact of the new GRCC on the outcomes of EC patients and the local community.",['Abdihamid O; Abdourahman H; Ibrahim A; Kareu T; Hadi A; Omar A; Mutebi M'],2024,"more than 80% of cases and deaths from EC occur within developing countries.

Anti-inflammatory Fucoidan-ConA oral insulin nanosystems for smart blood glucose regulation.,"The smart oral administration Insulin device has the potential to improve glycemic management. It can reduce the risk of hypoglycemia associated with exogenous Insulin (INS) therapy while also avoiding many of the disadvantages associated with subcutaneous injections. Furthermore, diabetes mellitus (DM) is an endocrine illness characterized by inflammation, and it is critical to minimize the amount of inflammatory markers in diabetic patients while maintaining average blood glucose. In this study, a responsive nanosystem vitamin B12-Fucoidan-Concanavalin A (VB12-FU-ConA NPs) with anti-inflammatory action was developed for smart oral delivery of Insulin. Con A has high sensitivity and strong specificity as a glucose-responsive material. Fucoidan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and hypoglycemic functions, and it can bind to Con A to form a reversible complex. Under high glucose conditions, free glucose competitively binds to Con A, which swells the nanocarrier and promotes Insulin release. Furthermore, in the low pH environment of the gastrointestinal tract, positively charged VB12 and anionic fucoidan bind tightly to protect the Insulin wrapped in the carrier, and VB12 can also bind to intestinal epithelial factors to improve transit rate, thereby promoting INS absorption. In vitro tests showed that the release of nanoparticles in hyperglycemic solutions was significantly higher than the drug release in normoglycemic conditions. Oral delivery of the nanosystems dramatically lowered blood glucose levels in type I diabetic mice (T1DM) during in vivo pharmacodynamics, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels reached a minimum of 8.1 ± 0.4 mmol/L after 8 h. Administering the nanosystem orally notably decreased the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in diabetic mice. The nano delivery system can be degraded and metabolized in the intestinal tract after being taken orally, demonstrating good biodegradability and biosafety. In conclusion, the present study showed that VB12-FU-ConA nanocarriers are expected to be a novel system for rationalizing blood glucose.",['Zhou J; Ma H; Guan M; Feng J; Dong X; Wei Y; Zhang T'],2024,smart oral administration Insulin device can reduce risk of hypoglycemia. it can also reduce the risk of hypoglycemia associated with exogenous Insulin therapy. diabetes mellitus is an endocrine illness characterized by inflammation.
CORRELATION OF LEPTIN AND ADIPONECTIN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION WITH CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN COLORECTAL CARCINOMA - A CROSS-SECTIONAL PROSPECTIVE STUDY.,"Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the common carcinomas with a rising incidence of metastasis due to its advanced stage of presentation. The existing biomarkers such as CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) etc., for prognosis, have low sensitivity and specificity. Hence a need for a newer definitive biomarker. Obesity is the leading cause of CRC. Leptin and adiponectin secreted by adipose tissue have been studied as potential biomarkers in the field of CRC. The present study helps to understand the association of leptin and adiponectin receptors with clinicopathological parameters. To correlate the various clinicopathological parameters with the tissue expression of leptin and adiponectin receptors in CRC. It is a cross-sectional prospective study conducted at a tertiary care hospital. Formalin fixed paraffin blocks of all radical resection CRC cases were collected and immunohistochemistry (IHC)was carried out on tumor tissue for leptin and adiponectin receptor. Tumor characteristics and clinical parameters were collected from the hospital medical records. Pearson's correlation coefficient test was used. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 60 cases of CRC. Significant positive correlation of leptin was observed with size, lymph node metastasis, advanced stage, and grade of tumor (P<0.05). A significant correlation between adiponectin receptor and CRC was observed concerning age, stage, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and grade of tumor. Positive expression of leptin and negative expression of adiponectin receptors in CRC helps to predict the risk of metastasis.",['Parmesh P; Dinesh US; Khandagale AS; Bapu AB; Sadashiv R; Reddy P'],2024,"colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the common carcinomas with a rising incidence of metastasis due to its advanced stage of presentation. existing biomarkers such as CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen) etc., for prognosis, have low sensitivity and specificity."

"Receipt of Diabetes Specialty Care and Management Services by Older Adults With Diabetes in the United States, 2015-2019: An Analysis of Medicare Fee-for-Service Claims.","We characterized the receipt of diabetes specialty care and management services among older adults with diabetes. Using a 20% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years, we analyzed cohorts of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) with history of severe hypoglycemia (HoH), and all other T2D annually from 2015 to 2019. Outcomes were receipt of office-based endocrinology care, diabetes education, outpatient diabetes health services, excluding those provided in primary care, and any of the aforementioned services. In the T1D cohort, receipt of endocrinology care and any service increased from 25.9% and 29.2% in 2015 to 32.7% and 37.4% in 2019, respectively. In the T2D with HoH cohort, receipt of endocrinology care and any service was 13.9% and 16.4% in 2015, with minimal increases. Age, race/ethnicity, residential setting, and income were associated with receiving care.

Puerarin alleviates atherosclerosis via the inhibition of <i>Prevotella copri</i> and its trimethylamine production.,"Puerarin (PU) is a natural compound that exhibits limited oral bioavailability but has shown promise in the treatment of atherosclerosis (AS). However, the precise mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of PU and its mechanisms in mitigating AS in both mice and humans. The impact of PU on AS was examined in <i>ApoE</i> <sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and in human patients with carotid artery plaque. To explore the causal link between PU-associated gut microbiota and AS, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and mono-colonisation of mice with <i>Prevotella copri</i> (<i>P. copri</i>) were employed. PU alleviated AS by modulating the gut microbiota, as evidenced by alterations in gut microbiota composition and the amelioration of AS following FMT from PU-treated mice into <i>ApoE<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice fed HFD. Specifically, PU reduced the abundance of <i>P. copri</i>, which exacerbated AS by producing trimethylamine (TMA). Prolonged mono-colonisation of <i>P. copri</i> undermines the beneficial effects of PU on AS. In clinical, the plaque scores of AS patients were positively correlated with the abundance of <i>P. copri</i> and plasma trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels. A 1-week oral intervention with PU effectively decreased <i>P. copri</i> levels and reduced TMAO concentrations in patients with carotid artery plaque. PU may provide therapeutic benefits in combating AS by targeting <i>P. copri</i> and its production of TMA.

The quality of reporting in case reports of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional study.,"Although randomized trials and systematic reviews provide the best evidence to guide medical practice, many permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) studies have been published as case reports. However, the quality of these studies has not been assessed. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which the current case reports for PNDM comply with the Case Report (CARE) guidelines and to explore variables associated with the reporting. Six English and four Chinese databases were searched from their inception to December 2022 for PNDM case reports. The 23 items CARE checklist was used to measure reporting quality. Primary outcome was the adherence rate of each CARE item and second outcome was total reporting score for each included PNDM case report. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to examine the connection between five pre-specified predictor variables and the reporting quality. The predictor variables were impact factor of the published journal (<3.4 vs. ≥3.4, categorized according to the median), funding (yes vs. no), language (English vs. other language), published journal type (general vs. special) and year of publication (>2013 vs. ≤ 2013). In total, 105 PNDM case reports were included in this study. None of the 105 PNDM case reports fulfilled all 23 items of the CARE checklist. The response rate of 11 items were under 50%, including prognostic characteristics presentation (0%), patient perspective interpretation (0%), diagnostic challenges statement (2.9%), clinical course summary (21.0%), diagnostic reasoning statement (22.9%), title identification (24.8%), case presentation (33.3%), disease history description (34.3%), strengths and limitations explanation (41.0%), informed consent statement (45.7%), and lesson elucidation (47.6%). This study identified that the PNDM case reports published in higher impact factor journals were statistically associated with a higher reporting quality. The reporting of case reports for PNDM is generally poor. As a result, this information may be misleading to providers, and the clinical applications may be detrimental to patient care.

Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-1 targeted siRNA promotes wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice by restoring glucose homeostasis.,"It is well-accepted that the liver plays a vital role in the metabolism of glucose and its homeostasis. Dysregulated hepatic glucose production and utilization, leads to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In the current study, RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of nanoformulation-treated T2DM mice (TG<sub>thr</sub> group) revealed beneficial crosstalk of PCK-1 silencing with other pathways involved in T2DM. The comparison of precise genetic expression profiles of the different experimental groups showed significantly improved hepatic glucose, fatty acid metabolism and several other T2DM-associated crucial markers after the nanoformulation treatment. As a result of these improvements, we observed a significant acceleration in wound healing and improved insulin signaling in vascular endothelial cells in the TG<sub>thr</sub> group as compared to the T2DM group. Enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt pathway proteins in the TG<sub>thr</sub> group resulted in increased angiogenesis as observed by the increased expression of endothelial cell markers (CD31, CD34) thereby improving endothelial dysfunctions in the TG<sub>thr</sub> group. Additionally, therapeutic nanoformulation has been observed to improve the inflammatory cytokine profile in the TG<sub>thr</sub> group. Overall, our results demonstrated that the synthesized therapeutic nanoformulation referred to as GPR8:PCK-1<sub>siRNA</sub> holds the potential in ameliorating hyperglycemia-associated complications such as delayed wound healing in diabetes.",['Bajaj G; Singh V; Sagar P; Gupta R; Singhal NK'],2024,RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR analysis of nanoformulation-treated T2DM mice showed beneficial crosstalk of PCK-1 silencing with other pathways involved in T2DM. a significant acceleration in wound healing and improved insulin signaling in vascular endothelial cells in the TGsub>thr/sub> group.
Fluorescence-Guided Spatial Drug Screening in 3D Colorectal Cancer Spheroids.,"The limited recapitulation of critical cancer features in two-dimensional (2D) cultures causes poor translatability of preclinical results from in vitro assays to in vivo tumor models. This contributes to slow drug development with a low success rate. Three-dimensional (3D) cultures better recapitulate the tumor microenvironment, enabling more accurate predictions when screening drug candidates and improving the development of chemotherapeutics. Platinum (Pt) (IV) compounds are promising prodrugs designed to reduce the severe systemic toxicity of widely-used Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Pt(II) drugs such as cisplatin. Here, we present spatiotemporal evaluations in 3D colorectal cancer (CRC) spheroids of mitochondria-targeting Pt(IV) complexes. CRC spheroids provide a greater pathophysiological recapitulation of in vivo tumors than 2D cultures by a marked upregulation of the ABCG2 chemoresistance marker expression. Furthermore, we introduce new 3D-staining protocols to evaluate the real-time decrease in mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨ) in CRC spheroids, and a Pt-sensing dye to quantify the Pt mitochondrial accumulation. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation between in vitro results and the efficacy of the compounds in vivo. Overall, the CRC spheroids represent a fast and cost-effective model to assess the behavior of Pt compounds in vitro and predict their translational potential in CRC treatment.

Association of Coronary Computed Tomography-Defined Myocardial Bridge With Pre- and Post-Procedural Fractional Flow Reserve in Patients Undergoing Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,"Myocardial bridge (MB) is a common coronary anomaly characterized by a tunneled course through the myocardium. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) can identify MB. The impact of MB detected by CCTA on coronary physiological parameters before and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unknown.Methods and Results: We investigated 141 consecutive patients who underwent pre-PCI CCTA and fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided elective PCI for de novo single proximal lesions in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). We compared clinical demographics and physiological parameters between patients with and without CCTA-defined MB. MB was identified in 46 (32.6%) patients using pre-PCI CCTA. The prevalence of diabetes was higher among patients with MB. Median post-PCI FFR values were significantly lower among patients with than without MB (0.82 [interquartile range 0.79-0.85] vs. 0.85 [interquartile range 0.82-0.89]; P=0.003), whereas pre-PCI FFR values were similar between the 2 groups. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of MB and greater left ventricular mass volume in the LAD territory were independently associated with lower post-PCI FFR values. Multivariable logistic regression analysis also revealed that the presence of MB and lower pre-PCI FFR values were independent predictors of post-PCI FFR values ≤0.80.

"Phylogenetic analysis and antigenic epitope prediction for E6 and E7 of Alpha-papillomavirus 9 in Taizhou, China.","Alpha-papillomavirus 9 (α-9) is a member of the human papillomavirus (HPV) α genus, causing 75% invasive cervical cancers worldwide. The purpose of this study was to provide data for effective treatment of HPV-induced cervical lesions in Taizhou by analysing the genetic variation and antigenic epitopes of α-9 HPV E6 and E7. Cervical exfoliated cells were collected for HPV genotyping. Positive samples of the α-9 HPV single type were selected for E6 and E7 gene sequencing. The obtained nucleotide sequences were translated into amino acid sequences (protein primary structure) using MEGA X, and positive selection sites of the amino acid sequences were evaluated using PAML. The secondary and tertiary structures of the E6 and E7 proteins were predicted using PSIPred, SWISS-MODEL, and PyMol. Potential T/B-cell epitopes were predicted by Industrial Engineering Database (IEDB). From 2012 to 2023, α-9 HPV accounted for 75.0% (7815/10423) of high-risk HPV-positive samples in Taizhou, both alone and in combination with other types. Among these, single-type-positive samples of α-9 HPV were selected, and the entire E6 and E7 genes were sequenced, including 298 HPV16, 149 HPV31, 185 HPV33, 123 HPV35, 325 HPV52, and 199 HPV58 samples.

Chloramphenicol alleviates 5-fluorouracil-induced cellular senescence through activation of autophagy.,"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a first-line treatment for colorectal cancer, but side effects such as severe diarrhea are common in clinical use and have been linked to its induction of normal cell senescence. Chloramphenicol (CAP) is an antibiotic commonly used to treat typhoid or anaerobic infections, but its senescence-related aspects have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we used 5-FU to induce senescence in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and investigated the relationship between CAP and cellular senescence at the cellular level. In a model of cellular senescence induced by 5-FU treatment, we discovered that CAP treatment reversed the rise in the percentage of senescence-associated galactosidase (SA-β-gal)-positive cells and decreased the expression of senescence-associated proteins (p16), senescence-associated genes (p21), and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs: IL-6, TNF-α). In addition, CAP subsequently restored the autophagic process inhibited by 5-FU and upregulated the levels of autophagy-related proteins. Mechanistically, we found that CAP restored autophagic flux by inhibiting the mTOR pathway, which in turn alleviated FU-induced cellular senescence. Our findings suggest that CAP may help prevent cellular senescence and restore autophagy, opening up new possibilities and approaches for the clinical management of colorectal cancer.",['Bai S; Zhao Q; Jia HJ; He F; Wang XB'],2024,5-FU is a first-line treatment for colorectal cancer. side effects such as severe diarrhea are common in clinical use.

Targeted Ferroptosis-Immunotherapy Synergy: Enhanced Antiglioma Efficacy with Hybrid Nanovesicles Comprising NK Cell-Derived Exosomes and RSL3-Loaded Liposomes.,"Ferroptosis therapy and immunotherapy have been widely used in cancer treatment. However, nonselective induction of ferroptosis in tumors is prone to immunosuppression, limiting the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis cancer treatment. To address this issue, this study reports a customized hybrid nanovesicle composed of NK cell-derived extracellular versicles and RSL3-loaded liposomes (hNRVs), aiming to establish a positive cycle between ferroptosis therapy and immunotherapy. Thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect and the tumor homing characteristics of NK exosomes, our data indicate that hNRVs can actively accumulate in tumors and enhance cellular uptake. FASL, IFN-γ, and RSL3 are released into the tumor microenvironment, where FASL derived from NK cells effectively lyses tumor cells. RSL3 downregulates the expression of GPX4 in the tumor, leading to the accumulation of LPO and ROS, and promotes ferroptosis in tumor cells. The accumulation of IFN-γ and TNF-α stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells and effectively induces the inactivation of GPX4, promoting lipid peroxidation, making them sensitive to ferroptosis and indirectly promoting the occurrence of ferroptosis. This study highlights the role of the customized hNRV platform in enhancing the effectiveness of synergistic treatment with selective delivery of ferroptosis inducers and immune activation against glioma without causing additional side effects on healthy organs.",['Hao W; Sun N; Fan Y; Chen M; Liu Q; Yang M; Yang Y; Gao C'],2024,hNRVs can actively accumulate in tumors and enhance cellular uptake. hNRVs are released into the tumor microenvironment. hNRVs are a customized nanovesicle composed of NK cell-derived extracellular versicles.
Development of an individualized model for predicting postoperative delirium in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in older patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that adversely impacts clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for POD and to construct a predictive nomogram. Data for a total of 1481 older patients (training set: n=1109; validation set: n=372) who received liver resection for HCC were retrospectively retrieved from two prospective databases. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance. The rate of POD was 13.3% (148/1109) in the training set and 16.4% (61/372) in the validation set. Multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that factors including age, history of cerebrovascular disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, albumin level, and surgical approach had significant effects on POD. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for the nomogram, incorporating the aforementioned predictors, was 0.798 (95% CI 0.752-0.843) and 0.808 (95% CI 0.754-0.861) for the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration curves of both sets showed a degree of agreement between the nomogram and the actual probability.

Mild therapeutic hypothermia upregulates the O-GlcNAcylation level of COX10 to alleviate mitochondrial damage induced by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Mild therapeutic hypothermia (MTH) is an important method for perioperative prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). Modifying mitochondrial proteins after protein translation to regulate mitochondrial function is one of the mechanisms for improving myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study investigated the relationship between shallow hypothermia treatment improving myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and the O-GlcNAcylation level of COX10. We used in vivo Langendorff model and in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell model to investigate the effects of MTH on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Histological changes, myocardial enzymes, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial structure/function were assessed. Mechanistic studies involved various molecular biology methods such as ELISA, immunoprecipitation (IP), WB, and immunofluorescence. Our research results indicate that MTH upregulates the O-GlcNACylation level of COX10, improves mitochondrial function, and inhibits the expression of ROS to improve myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In vivo, MTH effectively alleviates ischemia-reperfusion induced cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury, mitochondrial damage, and redox imbalance. In vitro, the OGT inhibitor ALX inhibits the OGT mediated O-GlcNA acylation signaling pathway, downregulates the O-Glc acylation level of COX10, promotes ROS release, and counteracts the protective effect of MTH. On the contrary, the OGA inhibitor ThG showed opposite effects to ALX, further confirming that MTH activated the OGT mediated O-GlcNAcylation signaling pathway to exert cardioprotective effects. In summary, MTH activates OGT mediated O-glycosylation modified COX10 to regulate mitochondrial function and improve myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, which provides important theoretical basis for the clinical application of MTH.",['Deng W; Chen Y; Zhang J; Ling J; Xu Z; Zhu Z; Tang X; Liu X; Zhang D; Zhu H; Lang H; Zhang L; Hua F; Yu S; Qian K; Yu P'],2024,a study investigated the relationship between shallow hypothermia treatment improving myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and the O-GlcNAcylation level of COX10. the study was used in vivo hypoxia/reoxygenation cell model.
Improved brain metastases segmentation using generative adversarial network and conditional random field optimization mask R-CNN.,"In radiotherapy, the delineation of the gross tumor volume (GTV) in brain metastases using computed tomography (CT) simulation localization is very important. However, despite the criticality of this process, a pronounced gap exists in the availability of tools tailored for the automatic segmentation of the GTV based on CT simulation localization images. This study aims to fill this gap by devising an effective tool specifically for the automatic segmentation of the GTV using CT simulation localization images. A dual-network generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture was developed, wherein the generator focused on refining CT images for more precise delineation, and the discriminator differentiated between real and augmented images. This architecture was coupled with the Mask R-CNN model to achieve meticulous GTV segmentation. An end-to-end training process facilitated the integration between the GAN and Mask R-CNN functionalities. Furthermore, a conditional random field (CRF) was incorporated to refine the initial masks generated by the Mask R-CNN model to ensure optimal segmentation accuracy. The performance was assessed using key metrics, namely, the Dice coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. The GAN+Mask R-CNN+CRF integration method in this study performs well in GTV segmentation. In particular, the model has an overall average DSC of 0.819 ± 0.102 and an IoU of 0.712 ± 0.111 in the internal validation. The overall average DSC in the external validation data is 0.726 ± 0.128 and the IoU is 0.640 ± 0.136. It demonstrates favorable generalization ability. The integration of the GAN, Mask R-CNN, and CRF optimization provides a pioneering tool for the sophisticated segmentation of the GTV in brain metastases using CT simulation localization images. The method proposed in this study can provide a robust automatic segmentation approach for brain metastases in the absence of MRI.",['Wang Y; Wen Z; Su L; Deng H; Gong J; Xiang H; He Y; Zhang H; Zhou P; Pang H'],2024,a pronounced gap exists in the availability of tools tailored for the automatic segmentation of the GTV using CT simulation localization images. the model has an overall average DSC of 0.819  0.102 and an IoU of 0.712  0.111 in the internal validation.
A whole-slide foundation model for digital pathology from real-world data.,"Digital pathology poses unique computational challenges, as a standard gigapixel slide may comprise tens of thousands of image tiles<sup>1-3</sup>. Prior models have often resorted to subsampling a small portion of tiles for each slide, thus missing the important slide-level context<sup>4</sup>. Here we present Prov-GigaPath, a whole-slide pathology foundation model pretrained on 1.3 billion 256 × 256 pathology image tiles in 171,189 whole slides from Providence, a large US health network comprising 28 cancer centres. The slides originated from more than 30,000 patients covering 31 major tissue types. To pretrain Prov-GigaPath, we propose GigaPath, a novel vision transformer architecture for pretraining gigapixel pathology slides. To scale GigaPath for slide-level learning with tens of thousands of image tiles, GigaPath adapts the newly developed LongNet<sup>5</sup> method to digital pathology. To evaluate Prov-GigaPath, we construct a digital pathology benchmark comprising 9 cancer subtyping tasks and 17 pathomics tasks, using both Providence and TCGA data<sup>6</sup>. With large-scale pretraining and ultra-large-context modelling, Prov-GigaPath attains state-of-the-art performance on 25 out of 26 tasks, with significant improvement over the second-best method on 18 tasks. We further demonstrate the potential of Prov-GigaPath on vision-language pretraining for pathology<sup>7,8</sup> by incorporating the pathology reports. In sum, Prov-GigaPath is an open-weight foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various digital pathology tasks, demonstrating the importance of real-world data and whole-slide modelling.",['Xu H; Usuyama N; Bagga J; Zhang S; Rao R; Naumann T; Wong C; Gero Z; González J; Gu Y; Xu Y; Wei M; Wang W; Ma S; Wei F; Yang J; Li C; Gao J; Rosemon J; Bower T; Lee S; Weerasinghe R; Wright BJ; Robicsek A; Piening B; Bifulco C; Wang S; Poon H'],2024,"a standard gigapixel slide may comprise tens of thousands of image tiles. prior models have often subsampled a small portion of tiles for each slide. this means that the slides originated from more than 30,000 patients."
Dynamic changes in RNA m<sup>6</sup>A and 5 hmC influence gene expression programs during macrophage differentiation and polarisation.,"RNA modifications are essential for the establishment of cellular identity. Although increasing evidence indicates that RNA modifications regulate the innate immune response, their role in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and polarisation is unclear. While m<sup>6</sup>A has been widely studied, other RNA modifications, including 5 hmC, remain poorly characterised. We profiled m<sup>6</sup>A and 5 hmC epitranscriptomes, transcriptomes, translatomes and proteomes of monocytes and macrophages at rest and pro- and anti-inflammatory states. Transcriptome-wide mapping of m<sup>6</sup>A and 5 hmC reveals enrichment of m<sup>6</sup>A and/or 5 hmC on specific categories of transcripts essential for macrophage differentiation. Our analyses indicate that m<sup>6</sup>A and 5 hmC modifications are present in transcripts with critical functions in pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages. Notably, we also discover the co-occurrence of m<sup>6</sup>A and 5 hmC on alternatively-spliced isoforms and/or opposing ends of the untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs with key roles in macrophage biology. In specific examples, RNA 5 hmC controls the decay of transcripts independently of m<sup>6</sup>A. This study provides (i) a comprehensive dataset to interrogate the role of RNA modifications in a plastic system (ii) a resource for exploring different layers of gene expression regulation in the context of human monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and polarisation, (iii) new insights into RNA modifications as central regulators of effector cells in innate immunity.",['Pinello N; Song R; Lee Q; Calonne E; Duan KL; Wong E; Tieng J; Mehravar M; Rong B; Lan F; Roediger B; Ma CJ; Yuan BF; Rasko JEJ; Larance M; Ye D; Fuks F; Wong JJ'],2024,msup>6/sup>A and 5 hmC modifications are present in transcripts with critical functions in pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages. msup>6/sup>A and 5 hmC modifications are present in transcripts with critical functions in pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages.
AI-enhanced integration of genetic and medical imaging data for risk assessment of Type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) presents a formidable global health challenge, highlighted by its escalating prevalence, underscoring the critical need for precision health strategies and early detection initiatives. Leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), we devise robust risk assessment models for T2D. Drawing upon comprehensive genetic and medical imaging datasets from 68,911 individuals in the Taiwan Biobank, our models integrate Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), Multi-image Risk Scores (MRS), and demographic variables, such as age, sex, and T2D family history. Here, we show that our model achieves an Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively identifying high-risk T2D subgroups. A streamlined model featuring eight key variables also maintains a high AUC of 0.939. This high accuracy for T2D risk assessment promises to catalyze early detection and preventive strategies. Moreover, we introduce an accessible online risk assessment tool for T2D, facilitating broader applicability and dissemination of our findings.",['Huang YJ; Chen CH; Yang HC'],2024,"eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models for T2D. based on comprehensive genetic and medical imaging datasets from 68,911 individuals. we create robust risk assessment models for T2D."
Comparative analysis of the image quality and diagnostic performance of the zooming technique with diffusion-weighted imaging using different b-values for thyroid papillary carcinomas and benign nodules.,"To compare image quality and diagnostic performance using different b-values for the zooming technique with diffusion-weighted imaging (ZOOMit-DWI) in thyroid nodules. A total of 51 benign thyroid nodules and 50 thyroid papillary carcinomas were included. ZOOMit-DWI was performed with b-values of 0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. The sharpness was evaluated as subjective index. The signal intensity ratio (SIR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured as objective indices. Pairwise comparisons were performed among the different b-value groups using the <i>Friedman</i> test. A receiver operating characteristic curve of the ADC value was used to evaluate diagnostic performance. The DeLong test was used to compare diagnostic effectiveness among the different b-value groups. In both the papillary carcinoma group (<i>P</i> = 0.670) and the benign nodule group (<i>P</i> = 0.185), the sharpness of nodules was similar between b-values of 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>and 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. In the papillary carcinoma group, the SIR<sub>nodule</sub> was statistically higher in DWI images with a b-value of 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>than in DWI images with b-values of 500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>(<i>P</i> = 0.004), 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>(<i>P</i> = 0.002), and 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>(<i>P</i> = 0.003). When the b-values were 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>(<i>P</i> = 0.008) and 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>(<i>P</i> = 0.009), the SIR<sub>nodule</sub> significantly differed between the papillary carcinoma group and the benign nodule group. When b = 500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, the ADC had an AUC of 0.888. When b = 1000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, the ADC had an AUC of 0.881. When b = 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, the ADC had an AUC of 0.896. When b = 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, the ADC had an AUC of 0.871. The DeLong test showed comparable diagnostic effectiveness among the different b-value groups except for between b-values of 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>and 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>, with a b-value of 2000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>showing lower effectiveness. This study suggests that 1500 s/mm<sup>2</sup>may be a suitable b-value to differentiate benign and malignant thyroid nodules in ZOOMit-DWI images, which yielded better image quality.",['Jiang L; Chen J; Tan Y; Wu J; Zhang J; Liu D; Zhang J'],2024,"a total of 51 benign thyroid nodules and 50 thyroid papillary carcinomas were included.

Novel Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe for Hepatocyte Growth Factor <i>in Vivo</i> Imaging in Surgical Navigation of Colorectal Cancer.,"Despite recent advancements in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment, the prognosis remains unfavorable primarily due to high recurrence and liver metastasis rates. Fluorescence molecular imaging technologies, combined with specific probes, have gained prominence in facilitating real-time tumor resection guided by fluorescence. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is overexpressed in CRC, but the advancement of HGF fluorescent probes has been impeded by the absence of effective HGF-targeting small-molecular ligands. Herein, we present the targeted capabilities of the novel V-1-GGGK-MPA probe labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent dye, which targets HGF in CRC. The V-1-GGGK peptide exhibits high specificity and selectivity for HGF-positive <i>in vitro</i> tumor cells and <i>in vivo</i> tumors. Biodistribution analysis of V-1-GGGK-MPA revealed tumor-specific accumulation with low background uptake, yielding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of tumor-to-colorectal >6 in multiple subcutaneous CRC models 12 h postinjection. Quantitative analysis confirmed the probe's high uptake in SW480 and HT29 orthotopic and liver metastatic models, with SNR values of tumor-to-colorectal and -liver being 5.6 ± 0.4, 4.6 ± 0.5, and 2.1 ± 0.3, 2.0 ± 0.5, respectively, enabling precise tumor visualization for surgical navigation. Pathological analysis demonstrated the excellent tumor boundaries discrimination capacity of the V-1-GGGK-MPA probe at the molecular level. With its rapid tumor targeting, sustained tumor retention, and precise tumor boundary delineation, V-1-GGGK-MPA merges as a promising HGF imaging agent, enriching the toolbox of intraoperative navigational fluorescent probes for CRC.",['Chen S; Li G; Pan R; Zhou K; Wen W; Tao J; Wang F; Han RPS; Pan H; Tu Y'],2024,fluorescent probes have gained prominence in facilitating real-time tumor resection. the advancement of HGF fluorescent probes has been impeded by the absence of effective HGF-targeting small-molecular ligands. the V-1-GGGK-MPA probe exhibits high specificity and selectivity for HGF-positive i>in vitro/i> tumor cells and i>in vivo/i> tumors.
Elevated remnant cholesterol is a risk factor for acute ischemic stroke.,"Remnant cholesterol (RC) is thought to be an important pathogenic risk factor for atherosclerosis, however, the relationship between RC and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is still unclear. This study aimed to determine whether fasting blood RC level is an independent risk factor for AIS. A retrospective analysis was performed on 650 patients with AIS and 598 healthy controls during the same time period. The association between RC and AIS was investigated using binary logistic regression, and the relationship between RC and AIS risk was demonstrated using Restricted Cubic Splines (RCS). RC was significantly higher in the AIS group compared with control group, and was an independent risk factor for AIS when the covariates were not adjusted;After adjusting some covariates, RC was still an independent risk factor for AIS. The RCS analysis found the risk was non-linear: when RC concentration was less than 0.69 mol/L, the risk of AIS increased with the elevation of RC, and when RC concentration was more than or equal to 0.69 mol/L, the risk of AIS was insignificant with the elevation of RC. Correlation analysis revealed that RC was associated with diabetes and fasting glucose. Further analysis revealed that the incidence of AIS in diabetic patients increased significantly with the increase of RC, and RCS analysis revealed that the risk of AIS in diabetic patients increased with the increase of RC when RC was more than 1.15 mol/L. This study confirms RC as an independent risk factor for AIS, which highlights a distinct non-linear association between RC levels and AIS risk. These findings suggest the need for targeted AIS risk assessment strategies, especially in diabetic patients, and underscore the relevance of RC as a biomarker in AIS risk stratification.",['Feng Q; Li H; Zhang RY; Sun L; Zhang SY; Chen Y; Zhang Y; Shan BS; Zhao Z; Zhou H; Xu X'],2024,RC is an independent risk factor for AIS. a retrospective analysis was performed on 650 patients with AIS.

Time-resolved small RNA transcriptomics of the ichthyosporean <i>Sphaeroforma arctica</i>.,"Ichthyosporea, a clade of holozoans, represent a clade closely related to animals, and thus hold a key phylogenetic position for understanding the origin of animals. We have previously discovered that an ichthyosporean, <i>Sphaeroforma arctica,</i> contains microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as the miRNA processing machinery. This was the first discovery of miRNAs among the closest single-celled relatives of animals and raised intriguing questions about the roles of regulatory small RNAs in cell development and differentiation in unicellular eukaryotes. Like many ichthyosporeans, <i>S. arctica</i> also undergoes a transient multicellular developmental life cycle. As miRNAs are, among other roles, key regulators of gene expression during development in animals, we wanted to investigate the dynamics of miRNAs during the developmental cycle in <i>S. arctica.</i> Here we have therefore collected a comprehensive time-resolved small RNA transcriptome linked to specific life stages with a substantially higher sequencing depth than before, which can enable further discovery of functionally relevant small RNAs. The data consists of Illumina-sequenced small RNA libraries from two independent biological replicates of the entire life cycle of <i>S. arctica</i> with high temporal resolution. The dataset is directly linked and comes from the same samples as a previously published mRNA-seq dataset, thus enabling direct cross-functional analyses.",['Ondracka A; Dudin O; Bråte J'],2023,"ichthyosporea, a clade of holozoans, are closely related to animals. the clade contains microRNAs as well as the miRNA processing machinery. this was the first discovery of miRNAs among the closest single-celled relatives of animals."
Utilities for Complications Associated with Type 2 Diabetes: A Review of the Literature.,"Utility values are used in health economic modeling analyses of type 2 diabetes (T2D) to quantify the effect of acute and long-term complications on quality of life (QoL). For accurate modeling projections, it is important that the utility values used are up to date, accurate and representative of the simulated model cohort. A literature review was performed to identify utility values for health states representing acute and chronic T2D-related complications including cardiovascular complications, stroke, renal disease, ophthalmic complications, neuropathy, diabetic foot, amputation and hypoglycemia. Searches were performed using the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases and limited to articles published since 2010. Supplementary searches were performed to identify data published at congresses in 2019-2023. A total of 54 articles were identified that reported utility values for T2D-related complications. The most frequently used elicitation method/instrument was the EQ-5D (n = 42 studies) followed by the Short Form-6 dimensions (n = 6), time tradeoff (n = 5), the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 or Mark 3 (n = 2), 15D (n = 1), visual analog scale (n = 1) and standard gamble (n = 1). Stroke and amputation were consistently associated with the largest decrements in QoL. There is a lack of published data that distinguishes between severity of several complications including renal disease, retinopathy and neuropathy. Diabetes-related complications can have a profound impact on QoL; therefore, it is important that these are captured accurately and appropriately in health economic models. Recently published utility values for diabetes-related complications that can be used to inform health economic models are summarized here.",['Valentine WJ; Norrbacka K; Boye KS'],2024,"utility values used in health economic modeling analyses of type 2 diabetes. utility values used are up to date, accurate and representative of simulated model cohort. a literature review was performed to identify utility values for health states representing acute and chronic T2D-related complications."
Non-adherence to Anti-diabetic Prescriptions Among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.,"Treatment adherence is a primary key in controlling diabetes disease. The study aims to determine the prevalence of treatment adherence in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, investigate the potential influence of adherence on elevated blood glucose levels, and identify the key factors which play a role in non-adherence to the prescribed drugs. A cross-sectional study method was utilized to collect data from all T2DM patients at the Diabetic and Endocrine Centre and Shar Hospital in Sulaymaniyah city in the Kurdistan region of Iraq from February 2022 to April 2022. The data collection was performed through a structured questionnaire. The prevalence of drug adherence was assessed using the Morisky Medication-Taking Adherence Scale (4-item), and the glycated hemoglobin test (A1C) was used to determine the blood glucose level. A total of 300 participants were studied, and more than half of them (192; 64%) revealed that they did not adhere to their anti-diabetic medications. Non-adherence was significantly associated with higher A1C. Several barriers to non-adherence were identified as multiple medications, feeling the dose given is high, lack of finance, and side effects by 209 (70%), 116 (39%), 113 (38%), and 103 (34%), respectively. The current study's result revealed that most T2DM patients have no adherence to their medication. This non-adherence is significantly linked to higher A1C levels, emphasizing the critical role of medication compliance in managing diabetes effectively. The study also sheds light on the multiple barriers such as taking multiple prescriptions, the perception that the dose is excessive, lack of finances, and experiencing side effects, which contribute to non-adherence among diabetes patients. These findings underscore the need for healthcare providers to address these barriers and develop tailored strategies to enhance medication adherence among individuals with diabetes.",['Hamalaw S; Hama Salih A; Weli S'],2024,treatment adherence is a key key in controlling diabetes disease. study aims to determine prevalence of treatment adherence in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. study aims to investigate potential influence of adherence on elevated blood glucose levels.
Animal studies of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered one of the most common chronic liver diseases. Modern lifestyle, characterized by increasing rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has led to a ""pandemic"" of NAFLD that imposes a personal health and socioeconomic burden. Apart from overnutrition and insulin resistance, various metabolic aberrations, gut microbiota and genetic predispositions are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The multifactorial nature of NAFLD's pathogenesis makes the development of pharmacological therapies for patients with this disease challenging. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are antidiabetic agents that reduce blood glucose mainly by increasing its renal excretion. As T2DM is one of the major contributors to NAFLD, SGLT-2i have emerged as promising agents for the management of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize the main animal studies on SGLT-2i in models of NAFLD.",['Makri ES; Makri E; Goulas A; Xanthopoulos K; Polyzos SA'],2024,"nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is considered one of the most common chronic liver diseases. a ""pandemic"" of NAFLD has led to a ""pandemic"" of the disease. a number of factors have contributed to the pathogenesis of the disease."
Absolute Lymphocyte Count after BCMA CAR-T Therapy is a Predictor of Response and Outcomes in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma.,"BCMA-targeting CAR-T cells used in multiple myeloma (MM) are rapidly becoming a mainstay in the treatment of relapsed/refractory (RR) disease, and CAR-T cell expansion post-infusion has been shown to inform depth and duration of response, but measuring this process remains investigational. This multicenter study describes the kinetics and prognostic impact of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in the first 15 days after CAR-T infusion in 156 relapsed MM patients treated with the BCMA-targeting agents cilta-cel and ide-cel. Patients with higher maximum ALC (ALCmax) had better depth of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DoR). Patients with ALCmax >1.0 x103/uL had a superior PFS (30.5 versus 6 months, p <0.001) compared to those ≤1.0x103/uL, while patients with ALCmax ≤0.5 x103/uL represent a high-risk group with early disease progression and short PFS (HR 3.4, 95 CI: 2 -5.8, P <0.001). In multivariate analysis, ALCmax >1.0 x103/uL and non-paraskeletal extramedullary disease were the only independent predictors of PFS and DoR after accounting for ISS staging, age, CAR-T product, high-risk cytogenetics and number of previous lines. Moreover, our flow cytometry data suggests that ALC is a surrogate for BCMA CAR-T expansion and can be used as an accessible prognostic marker. We report for the first time the association of ALC after BCMA CAR-T infusion with clinical outcomes and its utility in predicting response in RRMM patients.",['Mejia Saldarriaga M; Pan D; Unkenholz C; Mouhieddine TH; Velez-Hernandez JE; Engles K; Fein JA; Monge J; Rosenbaum CA; Pearse R; Jayabalan DS; Gordillo CA; Chan HT; Yamshon S; Thibaud S; Mapara MY; Inghirami GG; Lentzsch S; Reshef R; Rossi A; Parekh S; Jagannath S; Richard S; Niesvizky R; Bustoros M'],2024,"156 relapsed MM patients treated with the BCMA-targeting agents cilta-cel and ide-cel. patients with higher maximum ALC (ALCmax) had better depth of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DoR)"

This retrospective study included 141 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM): 45 without diabetic retinopathy (NDR), 47 with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and 49 with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Complete blood counts were obtained, and NLR, PLR, and SII were calculated. The study analysed the ability of inflammatory markers to predict DR using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The relationships between DR stages and SII, PLR, and NLP were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. The average NLR, PLR, and SII were higher in the PDR group than in the NPDR group (<i>P</i>=0.011, 0.043, 0.009, respectively); higher in the NPDR group than in the NDR group (<i>P</i><0.001 for all); and higher in the PDR group than in the NDR group (<i>P</i><0.001 for all). In the ROC curve analysis, the NLR, PLR, and SII were significant predictors of DR (<i>P</i><0.001 for all). The highest area under the curve (AUC) was for the PLR (0.929 for PLR, 0.925 for SII, and 0.821 for NLR).

[Multi-omics research progress in early-onset colorectal cancer].,"Globally, the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) among individuals younger than 50 is escalating. Compared to late-onset colorectal cancer, EOCRC exhibits distinct clinical, pathological, and molecular features, with a higher prevalence in the left colon and rectum. However, the occurrence and development of EOCRC is a multi-factor and multi-stage evolution process, which is the result of the mutual effect of environmental, genetic and biological factors, and involves the multi-level regulation mechanism of other organisms. With the development and improvement of high-throughput sequencing technology, the application of multi-omics analysis has become an important development direction to resolve the pathogenesis of complex diseases and individualized treatment plans.

How do mindfulness-based interventions promote coping and self-efficacy in patients with cancer: A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative data.,"The purpose of this study was to review the existing quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding how mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) help cope with cancer-related challenges and increase affected patients' perceived self-efficacy. A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, PsycInfo, PubPsych, and CINAHL. Quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies were included if they (1) evaluated MBIs (2) for patients with cancer or cancer survivors (3) regarding their impact on coping with cancer and perceived self-efficacy. The reports were screened by two independent reviewers and conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. The review was pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022368765). Findings from 28 reports of 19 quantitative studies, six qualitative studies, and three mixed-methods studies (total N = 1722) were extracted and integrated. The synthesis of quantitative data showed considerable heterogeneity in outcomes and measurement instruments. Most often reported were significant positive impacts of mindfulness on general coping skills, self-regulation, and perceived efficacy in coping with cancer. Qualitative interviews with patients supported those results. The three meta-themes identified were that MBI (1) provided patients with tools to use in stressful situations, (2) promoted a general change of mindset and (3) created a feeling of social connectedness. The reviewed studies suggest that MBI can promote coping and enhance the perceived self-efficacy of patients with cancer. In the future, more research investigating the different aspects of coping and the potentially moderating role of self-efficacy could provide further insights with respect to how coping and self-efficacy related to MBI.",['Heinen JM; Laing EM; Schäffeler N; Bäuerle A; Krakowczyk JB; Schug C; Ziesemer SK; Teufel M; Erim Y; Zipfel S; Stengel A; Graf J'],2024,quantitative and qualitative evidence was used to assess the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on coping with cancer. the findings were screened by two independent reviewers.
Artificial intelligence enables precision diagnosis of cervical cytology grades and cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer is a significant global health issue, its prevalence and prognosis highlighting the importance of early screening for effective prevention. This research aimed to create and validate an artificial intelligence cervical cancer screening (AICCS) system for grading cervical cytology. The AICCS system was trained and validated using various datasets, including retrospective, prospective, and randomized observational trial data, involving a total of 16,056 participants. It utilized two artificial intelligence (AI) models: one for detecting cells at the patch-level and another for classifying whole-slide image (WSIs). The AICCS consistently showed high accuracy in predicting cytology grades across different datasets. In the prospective assessment, it achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.947, a sensitivity of 0.946, a specificity of 0.890, and an accuracy of 0.892. Remarkably, the randomized observational trial revealed that the AICCS-assisted cytopathologists had a significantly higher AUC, specificity, and accuracy than cytopathologists alone, with a notable 13.3% enhancement in sensitivity. Thus, AICCS holds promise as an additional tool for accurate and efficient cervical cancer screening.",['Wang J; Yu Y; Tan Y; Wan H; Zheng N; He Z; Mao L; Ren W; Chen K; Lin Z; He G; Chen Y; Chen R; Xu H; Liu K; Yao Q; Fu S; Song Y; Chen Q; Zuo L; Wei L; Wang J; Ouyang N; Yao H'],2024,the system was trained and validated using various datasets. it used two artificial intelligence models for detecting cells at the patch-level.
Post-trial monitoring of a randomised controlled trial of intensive glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes extended from 10 years to 24 years (UKPDS 91).,"The 20-year UK Prospective Diabetes Study showed major clinical benefits for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes randomly allocated to intensive glycaemic control with sulfonylurea or insulin therapy or metformin therapy, compared with conventional glycaemic control. 10-year post-trial follow-up identified enduring and emerging glycaemic and metformin legacy treatment effects. We aimed to determine whether these effects would wane by extending follow-up for another 14 years. 5102 patients enrolled between 1977 and 1991, of whom 4209 (82·5%) participants were originally randomly allocated to receive either intensive glycaemic control (sulfonylurea or insulin, or if overweight, metformin) or conventional glycaemic control (primarily diet). At the end of the 20-year interventional trial, 3277 surviving participants entered a 10-year post-trial monitoring period, which ran until Sept 30, 2007. Eligible participants for this study were all surviving participants at the end of the 10-year post-trial monitoring period. An extended follow-up of these participants was done by linking them to their routinely collected National Health Service (NHS) data for another 14 years. Clinical outcomes were derived from records of deaths, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and accident and emergency unit attendances. We examined seven prespecified aggregate clinical outcomes (ie, any diabetes-related endpoint, diabetes-related death, death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and microvascular disease) by the randomised glycaemic control strategy on an intention-to-treat basis using Kaplan-Meier time-to-event and log-rank analyses. This study is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN75451837. Between Oct 1, 2007, and Sept 30, 2021, 1489 (97·6%) of 1525 participants could be linked to routinely collected NHS administrative data. Their mean age at baseline was 50·2 years (SD 8·0), and 41·3% were female. The mean age of those still alive as of Sept 30, 2021, was 79·9 years (SD 8·0). Individual follow-up from baseline ranged from 0 to 42 years, median 17·5 years (IQR 12·3-26·8). Overall follow-up increased by 21%, from 66 972 to 80 724 person-years. For up to 24 years after trial end, the glycaemic and metformin legacy effects showed no sign of waning. Early intensive glycaemic control with sulfonylurea or insulin therapy, compared with conventional glycaemic control, showed overall relative risk reductions of 10% (95% CI 2-17; p=0·015) for death from any cause, 17% (6-26; p=0·002) for myocardial infarction, and 26% (14-36; p<0·0001) for microvascular disease. Corresponding absolute risk reductions were 2·7%, 3·3%, and 3·5%, respectively. Early intensive glycaemic control with metformin therapy, compared with conventional glycaemic control, showed overall relative risk reductions of 20% (95% CI 5-32; p=0·010) for death from any cause and 31% (12-46; p=0·003) for myocardial infarction. Corresponding absolute risk reductions were 4·9% and 6·2%, respectively. No significant risk reductions during or after the trial for stroke or peripheral vascular disease were observed for both intensive glycaemic control groups, and no significant risk reduction for microvascular disease was observed for metformin therapy. Early intensive glycaemic control with sulfonylurea or insulin, or with metformin, compared with conventional glycaemic control, appears to confer a near-lifelong reduced risk of death and myocardial infarction.

Oral administration of coenzyme Q10 ameliorates memory impairment induced by nicotine-ethanol abstinence through restoration of biochemical changes in male rat hippocampal tissues.,"Substance abuse among adolescents has become a growing issue throughout the world. The significance of research on this life period is based on the occurrence of neurobiological changes in adolescent brain which makes the individual more susceptible for risk-taking and impulsive behaviors. Alcohol and nicotine are among the most available drugs of abuse in adolescents. Prolonged consumption of nicotine and alcohol leads to drug dependence and withdrawal which induce various dysfunctions such as memory loss. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ<sub>10)</sub> is known to improve learning and memory deficits induced by various pathological conditions such as Diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. In the present study we investigated whether CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment ameliorates memory loss following a nicotine-ethanol abstinence. Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests were done in male Wistar rats undergone nicotine-ethanol abstinence and the effect of CoQ10 was assessed on at behavioral and biochemical levels. Results indicated that nicotine-ethanol abstinence induces memory dysfunction which is associated with increased oxidative and inflammatory response, reduced cholinergic and neurotrophic function plus elevated Amyloid-B levels in hippocampi. CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment prevented memory deficits and biochemical alterations. Interestingly, this ameliorative effect of CoQ<sub>10</sub> was found to be dose-dependent in most experiments and almost equipotential to that of bupropion and naloxone co-administration. CoQ<sub>10</sub> treatment could effectively improve memory defects induced by nicotine-ethanol consumption through attenuation of oxidative damage, inflammation, amyloid-B level and enhancement of cholinergic and neurotrophic drive. Further studies are required to assess the unknown side effects and high dose tolerability of the drug in human subjects.",['Ahmadi-Soleimani SM; Ghasemi S; Rahmani MA; Gharaei M; Mohammadi Bezanaj M; Beheshti F'],2024,substance abuse among adolescents has become a growing issue in the world. alcohol and nicotine are among the most available drugs of abuse in adolescents. prolonged consumption of nicotine leads to drug dependence and withdrawal.
Ultrasound-induced immune responses in tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Ultrasound is widely used in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer. Tumors can be treated by thermal or mechanical tissue ablation. Furthermore, tumors can be manipulated by hyperthermia, sonodynamic therapy and sonoporation, e.g., by increasing tumor perfusion or the permeability of biological barriers to enhance drug delivery. These treatments induce various immune responses in tumors. However, conflicting data and high heterogeneity between experimental settings make it difficult to generalize the effects of ultrasound on tumor immunity. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to answer the question: ""Does ultrasound alter the immune reaction of peripheral solid tumors in humans and animals compared to control conditions without ultrasound?"" A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science and 24,401 potentially relevant publications were identified. Of these, 96 publications were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Experiments were performed in humans, rats, and mice and focused on different tumor types, primarily breast and melanoma. We collected data on thermal and non-thermal ultrasound settings, the use of sono-sensitizers or sono-enhancers, and anti-tumor therapies. Six meta-analyses were performed to quantify the effect of ultrasound on tumor infiltration by T cells (cytotoxic, helper, and regulatory T cells) and on blood cytokines (interleukin-6, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α). We provide robust scientific evidence that ultrasound alters T cell infiltration into tumors and increases blood cytokine concentrations. Furthermore, we identified significant differences in immune cell infiltration based on tumor type, ultrasound settings, and mouse age. Stronger effects were observed using hyperthermia in combination with sono-sensitizers and in young mice. The latter may impair the translational impact of study results as most cancer patients are older. Thus, our results may help refining ultrasound parameters to enhance anti-tumor immune responses for therapeutic use and to minimize immune effects in diagnostic applications.",['Rix A; Heinrichs H; Porte C; Leenaars C; Bleich A; Kiessling F'],2024,ultrasound is widely used in diagnosis and therapy of cancer. tumors can be treated by thermal or mechanical tissue ablation. ultrasound alters T cell infiltration by T cells and on blood cytokines.
"Childhood adversity, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms among pre-abortion Chinese women.","Unintended (unwanted) pregnancy is a sexual and reproductive health issue with psychosocial consequences for the individual, their family, and society. However, the relationship between social support and related mental health issues, like depression and the effects of childhood adversity, is poorly studied. This study aims to explore the connections between childhood adversity, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms in pre-abortion women (women who have decided to have an abortion) in a clinical setting, based on the common risk factor approach and social support theory. A total of 299 pre-abortion Chinese women 18-45 years were recruited in a hospital in Shantou, China. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were employed to examine the relative effects of childhood adversity and sources of social support on depressive symptoms, controlling for sociodemographic influences. The results show that 37.2 percent of participants reported at least one adverse experience in childhood. More than half of the respondents were at risk for depression. Results of regression analysis showed that childhood adversities were negatively associated with depressive symptoms before sources of social support were entered into the model. However, when the sources of perceived social support were added, the effect of childhood adversity was not significant. Perceived social support explained the additional 15 percent variance in depressive symptoms. Additionally, being married (β = -.12, p < .05) and number of siblings (β = .13, p < .05) were significantly related to depressive symptoms. Pre-abortion women are at risk of mental health problems. Peer and familial social supports can alleviate the influence of childhood adversity on depression among pre-abortion Chinese women. Strengthening the role of various sources of social support can help to improve the mental health conditions of pre-abortion women.",['Yang S; Wang Y; Fang B; Chen B; Chen P; Xie L; Zhong Z; Chen G'],2024,study aims to explore the connections between childhood adversity and perceived social support. a total of 299 pre-abortion women 18-45 years were recruited in a hospital in china.
Fair evaluation of federated learning algorithms for automated breast density classification: The results of the 2022 ACR-NCI-NVIDIA federated learning challenge.,"The correct interpretation of breast density is important in the assessment of breast cancer risk. AI has been shown capable of accurately predicting breast density, however, due to the differences in imaging characteristics across mammography systems, models built using data from one system do not generalize well to other systems. Though federated learning (FL) has emerged as a way to improve the generalizability of AI without the need to share data, the best way to preserve features from all training data during FL is an active area of research. To explore FL methodology, the breast density classification FL challenge was hosted in partnership with the American College of Radiology, Harvard Medical Schools' Mass General Brigham, University of Colorado, NVIDIA, and the National Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute. Challenge participants were able to submit docker containers capable of implementing FL on three simulated medical facilities, each containing a unique large mammography dataset. The breast density FL challenge ran from June 15 to September 5, 2022, attracting seven finalists from around the world. The winning FL submission reached a linear kappa score of 0.653 on the challenge test data and 0.413 on an external testing dataset, scoring comparably to a model trained on the same data in a central location.",['Schmidt K; Bearce B; Chang K; Coombs L; Farahani K; Elbatel M; Mouheb K; Marti R; Zhang R; Zhang Y; Wang Y; Hu Y; Ying H; Xu Y; Testagrose C; Demirer M; Gupta V; Akünal Ü; Bujotzek M; Maier-Hein KH; Qin Y; Li X; Kalpathy-Cramer J; Roth HR'],2024,"breast density classification FL challenge was hosted by the American College of Radiology, the mass general Brigham, the university of Colorado, and the national Institutes of Health National Cancer Institute. the winning FL submission reached a linear kappa score of 0.653 on the challenge test data and 0.413 on an external testing dataset."
The prevalence and severity of upper gastrointestinal complications among patients with chronic diseases: a cross-sectional study from Palestine.,"Many old people have at least one chronic disease. As a result, multiple drugs should be used. Gastrointestinal complications may occur because of the harmful effects of these chronic drugs on the stomach. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal complications in patients taking chronic medications, the severity of these symptoms, and whether they take any gastro-protective drugs or not. This was a cross-sectional study through face-to-face questionnaires from internal outpatient clinics at a specialized hospital. Patients with chronic diseases who were taking at least one chronic medication were included in the study. Data Collection Form was used to gather information. The Short-Form Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (SF-LDQ) was used to evaluate the severity of the upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21. A total of 400 patients with chronic diseases and using multiple medications were included. Among them, 53.8% were females and 56% were married, 58.5% were unemployed, 70% were not smokers, the mean age was 54.7 ± 17.5 years. The most common comorbid diseases among the patients were diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis, with percentages of 44.3%, 38%, and 27.3%, respectively. The mean number of chronic medications used was 3.36 ± 1.6 with a range of 1 to 9. The most commonly used was aspirin with a percentage of 50%, followed by atorvastatin, bisoprolol, and insulin with percentages of 29.5%, 25%, and 20.3%, respectively. Among the 400 participants, 362 (90.5%) suffered from upper gastrointestinal side effects like indigestion (65.8%), heartburn (78.3%), nausea (48.8%), and regurgitation (52.0%). Based on SF-LDQ scoring, of the 400 respondents, 235(58.8%), 109(27.3%) and 18(4.5%) suffered from mild, moderate and severe dyspepsia, respectively. A high percentage 325 (81.3%) of participants were prescribed gastro-protective medications. Proton pump inhibitors were the most prescribed group in 209 (52.3%) patients. Dyspepsia was significantly associated with older age (p-value = 0.001), being educated (p-value = 0.031), not being single (p-value < 0.001), having health insurance (p-value = 0.021), being a smoker (p-value = 0.003), and using ≥ 5 medications (p-value < 0.001). Upper gastrointestinal complications among patients with chronic diseases were very common. Fortunately, the symptoms were mild in most cases. The risk increased with age and using a higher number of medications. It is important to review patients' medications and avoid overuse of them, in addition to use gastro-protective agents when needed.",['Al Ramahi R; Tumeh D'],2024,study aimed to assess prevalence of upper gastrointestinal complications in patients taking chronic medications. patients with chronic diseases who were taking at least one chronic medication were included in the study.
Gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy.,"A high risk of complications still accompanies gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy. In this narrative review, we summarize the technological progress and the problems of gastric conduit reconstruction after esophagectomy. Several types of gastric conduits exist, including the whole stomach and the narrow gastric tube. The clinical outcomes are similar between the two types of conduits. Sufficient blood supply to the conduit is mandatory for a successful esophageal reconstruction. Recently, due to the availability of equipment and its convenience, indocyanine green angiography has been rapidly spreading. When the blood perfusion of the planning anastomotic site is insufficient, several techniques, such as the Kocher maneuver, pedunculated gastric tube with duodenal transection, and additional microvascular anastomosis, exist to decrease the risk of anastomotic failure. There are two different anastomotic sites, cervical and thoracic, and mainly two reconstructive routes, retrosternal and posterior mediastinal routes. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference in outcomes between the anastomotic sites as well as the reconstructive routes. Anastomotic techniques include hand-sewn, circular, and linear stapling. Anastomoses using linear stapling is advantageous in decreasing anastomosis-related complications. Arteriosclerosis and poorly controlled diabetes are the risk factors for anastomotic leakage, while a narrow upper mediastinal space and a damaged stomach predict leakage. Although standardization among the institutional team members is essential to decrease anastomotic complications, surgeons should learn several technical options for predictable or unpredictable intraoperative situations.",['Watanabe M; Takahashi N; Tamura M; Terayama M; Kuriyama K; Okamura A; Kanamori J; Imamura Y'],2024,esophagectomy is a long-term cause of complications. a high risk of complications still accompanies gastric conduit reconstruction. the esophagectomy is a long-term cause of complications.
Predicting the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Brazil: a modeling study.,"We adopted a modeling approach to predict the likely future prevalence of type 2 diabetes, taking into account demographic changes and trends in obesity and smoking in Brazil. We then used the model to estimate the likely future impact of different policy scenarios, such as policies to reduce obesity. The IMPACT TYPE 2 DIABETES model uses a Markov approach to integrate population, obesity, and smoking trends to estimate future type 2 diabetes prevalence. We developed a model for the Brazilian population from 2006 to 2036. Data on the Brazilian population in relation to sex and age were collected from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, and data on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and smoking were collected from the Surveillance of Risk and Protection Factors for Chronic Diseases by Telephone Survey (VIGITEL). The observed prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Brazilians aged over 25 years was 10.8% (5.2-14.3%) in 2006, increasing to 13.7% (6.9-18.4%) in 2020. Between 2006 and 2020, the observed prevalence in men increased from 11.0 to 19.1% and women from 10.6 to 21.3%. The model forecasts a dramatic rise in prevalence by 2036 (27.0% overall, 17.1% in men and 35.9% in women). However, if obesity prevalence declines by 1% per year from 2020 to 2036 (Scenario 1), the prevalence of diabetes decreases from 26.3 to 23.7, which represents approximately a 10.0% drop in 16 years. If obesity declined by 5% per year in 16 years as an optimistic target (Scenario 2), the prevalence of diabetes decreased from 26.3 to 21.2, representing a 19.4% drop in diabetes prevalence. The model predicts an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Brazil. Even with ambitious targets to reduce obesity prevalence, type 2 diabetes in Brazil will continue to have a large impact on Brazilian public health.","[""Moreira PVL; de Arruda Neta ADCP; Ferreira FELL; de Araújo JM; Rodrigues REA; de Lima RLFC; Vianna RPT; da Silva Neto JM; O'Flaherty M""]",2024,"model used markov approach to integrate population, obesity, and smoking trends. model for the Brazilian population from 2006 to 2036. if obesity prevalence declines by 1% per year from 2020 to 2036, prevalence of diabetes decreases from 26.3 to 23.7."
Association of Body Composition Changes with the Development of Diabetes Mellitus: A Nation-Wide Population Study.,"We investigated the association between body composition changes and new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) development according to the body mass index (BMI) in a longitudinal setting in the general Korean population. From 2010 to 2011 (1st) and 2012 to 2013 (2nd), we included 1,607,508 stratified random sample participants without DM from the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening dataset of Korean. The predicted appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (pASMMI), body fat mass index (pBFMI), and lean body mass index (pLBMI) were calculated using pre-validated anthropometric prediction equations. A prediction equation was constructed by combining age, weight, height, waist circumference, serum creatinine levels, alcohol consumption status, physical activity, and smoking history as variables affecting body composition. Decreased pASMMI (men: hazard ratio [HR], 0.866; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.830 to 0.903; P<0.001; women: HR, 0.748; 95% CI, 0.635 to 0.881; P<0.001), decreased pLBMI (men: HR, 0.931; 95% CI, 0.912 to 0.952; P<0.001; women: HR, 0.906; 95% CI, 0.856 to 0.959; P=0.007), and increased pBFMI (men: HR, 1.073; 95% CI, 1.050 to 1.096; P<0.001; women: HR, 1.114; 95% CI, 1.047 to 1.186; P=0.007) correlated with the development of new-onset DM. Notably, only in the overweight and obese BMI categories, decreases in pASMMI and pLBMI and increases in pBFMI associated with new-onset DM, regardless of gender. Decreased pASMMI and pLBMI, and increased pBFMI with excess fat accumulation may enhance the risk of newonset DM. Therefore, appropriate changes in body composition can help prevent new-onset DM.",['Kim HJ; Lee HW; Kang MK; Leem GH; Kim MH; Song TJ'],2024,"from 2010 to 2011 (1st) and 2012 to 2013 (2nd), 1,607,508 random sample participants without DM were calculated using pre-validated anthropometric prediction equations. predicted appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (pASMMI), body fat mass index (pBFMI) and lean body mass index (pLBMI) were calculated using pre-validated anthropometric prediction equations."
"[Adequacy of provision of procedures for early detection of breast cancer in the Brazilian Unified National Health System: a cross-sectional study conducted in Brazil and its regions, 2019].","Early detection is a major strategy in breast cancer control and, for this reason, it is important to ensure access to investigation of suspected cases for care continuity and timely treatment. This study aimed to estimate the need for procedures of breast cancer early detection and assess their adequacy for providing care to screened and symptomatic women in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in 2019. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to analyze the provision of tests for breast cancer early detection, comparing the estimated need with the procedures performed in the SUS. Parameters provided by the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were used to estimate the population and the need for early detection tests.

Cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Cancer patients with diabetes are at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases due to common risk factors and well-documented drug-associated cardiotoxicity. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown cardiovascular benefits in patients with diabetes, but their effects on cancer patients remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the cardiovascular outcomes associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in patients with concomitant diabetes and cancer. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies comparing cardiovascular outcomes between cancer patients with diabetes receiving SGLT2 inhibitors and those not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 29, 2024. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcomes were heart failure hospitalization, and adverse events. Random-effect models were used to calculate pooled risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify potential sources of heterogeneity and explore the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on mitigating cardiotoxicity. Nine cohort studies involving 82,654 patients were included. SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.68, P < 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 98%) and heart failure hospitalization (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.81, P = 0.006; I<sup>2</sup> = 21%) compared to non-use. The mortality benefit remained significant in patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.89, P = 0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 71%). SGLT2 inhibitor use was also associated with a lower risk of sepsis (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.23-0.44, P < 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) and no increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.20-2.16, P = 0.49; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization in patients with concomitant diabetes and cancer. These findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors may offer cardiovascular benefits in this high-risk population.

Quantitative live-cell imaging of secretion activity reveals dynamic immune responses.,"Quantification of cytokine secretion has facilitated advances in the field of immunology, yet the dynamic and varied secretion profiles of individual cells, particularly those obtained from limited human samples, remain obscure. Herein, we introduce a technology for quantitative live-cell imaging of secretion activity (qLCI-S) that enables high-throughput and dual-color monitoring of secretion activity at the single-cell level over several days, followed by transcriptome analysis of individual cells based on their phenotype. The efficacy of qLCI-S was demonstrated by visualizing the characteristic temporal pattern of cytokine secretion of group 2 innate lymphoid cells, which constitute less than 0.01% of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and by revealing minor subpopulations with enhanced cytokine production. The underlying mechanism of this feature was linked to the gene expression of stimuli receptors. This technology paves the way for exploring gene expression signatures linked to the spatiotemporal dynamic nature of various secretory functions.",['Yamagishi M; Miyata K; Kamatani T; Kabata H; Baba R; Tanaka Y; Suzuki N; Matsusaka M; Motomura Y; Kiniwa T; Koga S; Goda K; Ohara O; Funatsu T; Fukunaga K; Moro K; Uemura S; Shirasaki Y'],2024,quantitative live-cell imaging of secretion activity (qLCI-S) allows high-throughput and dual-color monitoring of secretion activity. qLCI-S was demonstrated by visualizing the characteristic temporal pattern of cytokine secretion of group 2 innate lymphoid cells.
Incident heart failure in chronic kidney disease: proteomics informs biology and risk stratification.,"Incident heart failure (HF) among individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) incurs hospitalizations that burden patients and health care systems. There are few preventative therapies, and the Pooled Cohort equations to Prevent Heart Failure (PCP-HF) perform poorly in the setting of CKD. New drug targets and better risk stratification are urgently needed. In this analysis of incident HF, SomaScan V4.0 (4638 proteins) was analysed in 2906 participants of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) with validation in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. The primary outcome was 14-year incident HF (390 events); secondary outcomes included 4-year HF (183 events), HF with reduced ejection fraction (137 events), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (165 events). Mendelian randomization and Gene Ontology were applied to examine causality and pathways. The performance of novel multi-protein risk models was compared to the PCP-HF risk score. Over 200 proteins were associated with incident HF after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate at P < 1 × 10-5. After adjustment for covariates including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, 17 proteins remained associated at P < 1 × 10-5. Mendelian randomization associations were found for six proteins, of which four are druggable targets: FCG2B, IGFBP3, CAH6, and ASGR1. For the primary outcome, the C-statistic (95% confidence interval [CI]) for the 48-protein model in CRIC was 0.790 (0.735, 0.844) vs. 0.703 (0.644, 0.762) for the PCP-HF model (P = .001). C-statistic (95% CI) for the protein model in ARIC was 0.747 (0.707, 0.787). Large-scale proteomics reveal novel circulating protein biomarkers and potential mediators of HF in CKD.

Novel Definitive Hypofractionated Accelerated Radiation Dose-painting (HARD) for Unresected Soft Tissue Sarcomas.,"Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are historically radioresistant, with surgery being an integral component of their treatment. With their low α/β, STS may be more responsive to hypofractionated radiation therapy (RT), which is often limited by long-term toxicity risk to surrounding normal tissue. An isotoxic approach using a hypofractionated accelerated radiation dose-painting (HARD) regimen allows for dosing based on clinical risk while sparing adjacent organs at risk. We retrospectively identified patients from 2019 to 2022 with unresected STS who received HARD with dose-painting to high, intermediate, and low-risk regions of 3.0 Gy, 2.5 Gy, and 2.0 to 2.3 Gy, respectively, in 20 to 22 fractions. Clinical endpoints included local control, locoregional control, progression free survival, overall survival, and toxicity outcomes. Twenty-seven consecutive patients were identified and had a median age of 68 years and tumor size of 7.0 cm (range, 1.2-21.0 cm). Tumors were most often high-grade (70%), stage IV (70%), located in the extremities (59%), and locally recurrent (52%). With a median follow-up of 33.4 months, there was a 3-year locoregional control rate of 100%. The 3-year overall and progression-free survival were 44.9% and 23.3%, respectively. There were 5 (19%) acute and 2 (7%) late grade 3 toxicities, and there were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities at any point. The HARD regimen is a safe method of dose-escalating STS, with durable 3-year locoregional control. This approach is a promising alternative for unresected STS, though further follow-up is required to determine long-term control and toxicity.",['Bryant JM; Mills MN; Yang GQ; Liveringhouse C; Palm R; Johnstone PA; Miller JT; Latifi K; Feygelman V; Naghavi AO'],2024,a hypofractionated accelerated radiation dose-painting regimen allows for dosing based on clinical risk while sparing adjacent organs at risk. the accelerated radiation dose-painting regimen is a safe and effective treatment.
The CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance checkpoint triggers a distinct differentiation state defined by protein translation defects.,"Peripheral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell tolerance is a checkpoint in both autoimmune disease and anti-cancer immunity. Despite its importance, the relationship between tolerance-induced states and other CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation states remains unclear. Using flow cytometric phenotyping, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin accessibility profiling, we demonstrated that in vivo peripheral tolerance to a self-antigen triggered a fundamentally distinct differentiation state separate from exhaustion, memory, and functional effector cells but analogous to cells defectively primed against tumors. Tolerant cells diverged early and progressively from effector cells, adopting a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct state within 60 h of antigen encounter. Breaching tolerance required the synergistic actions of strong T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and inflammation, which cooperatively induced gene modules that enhanced protein translation. Weak TCR signaling during bystander infection failed to breach tolerance due to the uncoupling of effector gene expression from protein translation. Thus, tolerance engages a distinct differentiation trajectory enforced by protein translation defects.",['Van Der Byl W; Nüssing S; Peters TJ; Ahn A; Li H; Ledergor G; David E; Koh AS; Wagle MV; Deguit CDT; de Menezes MN; Travers A; Sampurno S; Ramsbottom KM; Li R; Kallies A; Beavis PA; Jungmann R; Bastings MMC; Belz GT; Goel S; Trapani JA; Crabtree GR; Chang HY; Amit I; Goodnow CC; Luciani F; Parish IA'],2024,tolerance-induced states are a checkpoint in autoimmune disease and anti-cancer immunity. tolerance triggered a fundamentally distinct differentiation state. tolerance required the synergistic actions of strong T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and inflammation.
What is the clinical significance of low serum amylase? Systematic review of the conditions associated with low serum amylase.,"Most studies have assessed the impact of elevated serum amylase levels in clinical practice, but only a few have investigated the significance of low serum amylase. We therefore, aimed to review the literature to understand the conditions associated with low serum amylase and its clinical relevance. This systematic review was performed in accordance with the criteria established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The search was conducted on Medline and Embase databases until November 2022. After identifying relevant titles, abstracts were read and data of eligible articles retrieved. The conditions associated with low serum amylase were evaluated. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Score. Our search strategy identified 19 studies including a total of 15 097 patients for systematic review. All the studies were observational including two studies which used secretin-induced test. The main conditions associated with low serum amylase were diabetes mellitus (n=9), metabolic syndrome (n=3), chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n=3), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n=2) and obesity (n=1). Low serum amylase showed a high specificity (94%) with low sensitivity (38.7%-59%) in diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. This systematic review revealed a unique insight into the relevance of low serum amylase in clinical practice. Low serum amylase can be a useful adjunct test in the assessment of patients with CP, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome.",['Jalal M; Gbadegesin SA; Tehami N; Nakajima K'],2024,systematic review was performed in accordance with criteria established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. the search was conducted on Medline and Embase databases until November 2022.
In the heart and beyond: Mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major cardiovascular disorder with increasing prevalence and a limited range of targeted treatment options. While HFpEF can be derived from several different etiologies, much of the current growth in the disease is being driven by metabolic dysfunction (e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension). Deleterious changes in mitochondrial energy metabolism are a common feature of HFpEF, and may help to drive the progression of the disease. In this brief article we aim to review various aspects of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in HFpEF, discuss the emerging topic of HFpEF-driven mitochondrial dysfunction in tissues beyond the heart, and examine whether supporting mitochondrial function may be a therapeutic approach to arrest or reverse disease development.",['Bhattarai N; Scott I'],2024,heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major cardiovascular disorder.

Do no harm: the impact of implementing cancer prevention strategies on other preventive health measures.,"Translational efforts to increase uptake of evidence-based practices typically look at those outcomes in isolation of their impact on other aspects of care delivery. If we are in fact to ""do no harm"", we must consider the possible negative impact of improving use of one practice on other quality measures. Alternatively, a focus on one practice could lead to spread of effective strategies to other practices, which would be highly beneficial. We studied the impact of a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening initiative on delivery of other preventive care measures. We used an interrupted time series design with implementation year as the interruption point. The initiative was conducted between 2015 and 2020, with three staggered cohorts. Main outcomes were quality measures for colorectal cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, hypertension management, diabetes management, weight screening and follow-up, tobacco use screening and cessation treatment, and depression screening and follow-up. The initiative was associated with an increase in CRC screening (OR = 1.67, p ≤ 0.01; average marginal effect = 12.2% points), and did not reduce performance on other quality measures in the year of CRC program implementation or a change in their respective secular trends. The initiative led to a clinically meaningful increase in CRC screening and was not associated with reductions in delivery of six other preventive services. Quality improvement (QI) initiatives typically approach implementation with an eye towards reducing unintended impact and leveraging existing staff and resources. Implementation research studies may benefit from considering how QI initiatives factor in the local context in implementation efforts.",['Emmons KM; Pelton-Cairns L; Gundersen DA; Cruz JL; Mascioli L; Kruse GR'],2024,a colorectal cancer screening initiative was conducted between 2015 and 2020. the initiative led to a clinically meaningful increase in CRC screening. the initiative was not associated with reductions in delivery of six other preventive services.
Tripartite motif-containing protein 21 is involved in IFN-γ-induced suppression of hepatitis B virus by regulating hepatocyte nuclear factors.,"The antiviral role of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family , a member of the E3-ubiquitin ligase family, has recently been actively studied. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major contributor to liver diseases; however, the host factors regulated by cytokine-inducible TRIM21 to suppress HBV remain unclear. In this study, we showed the antiviral efficacy of TRIM21 against HBV in hepatoma cell lines, primary human hepatocytes isolated from patient liver tissues, and mouse model. Using TRIM21 knock-out cells, we confirmed that the antiviral effects of interferon-gamma, which suppress HBV replication, are diminished when TRIM21 is deficient. Northern blot analysis confirmed a reduction of HBV RNA levels by TRIM21. Using Luciferase reporter assay, we also discovered that TRIM21 decreases the activity of HBV enhancers, which play a crucial role in covalently closed circular DNA transcription. The participation of the RING domain and PRY-SPRY domain in the anti-HBV effect of TRIM21 was demonstrated through experiments using deletion mutants. We identified a novel interaction between TRIM21 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) through co-immunoprecipitation assay. More specifically, ubiquitination assay revealed that TRIM21 promotes ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of HNF4α. HNF1α transcription is down-regulated as a result of the degradation of HNF4α, an activator for the HNF1α promoter. Therefore, the reduction of key HBV enhancer activators, HNF4α and HNF1α, by TRIM21 resulted in a decline in HBV transcription, ultimately leading to the inhibition of HBV replication.IMPORTANCEDespite extensive research efforts, a definitive cure for chronic hepatitis B remains elusive, emphasizing the persistent importance of this viral infection as a substantial public health concern. Although the risks associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are well known, host factors capable of suppressing HBV are largely uncharacterized. This study elucidates that tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) suppresses HBV transcription and consequently inhibits HBV replication by downregulating the hepatocyte nuclear factors, which are host factors associated with the HBV enhancers. Our findings demonstrate a novel anti-HBV mechanism of TRIM21 in interferon-gamma-induced anti-HBV activity. These findings may contribute to new strategies to block HBV.",['Won J; Kang HS; Kim NY; Dezhbord M; Marakkalage KG; Lee E-H; Lee D; Park S; Kim D-S; Kim K-H'],2024,TRIM21 is a member of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein family. hepatitis B virus is a major contributor to liver diseases. ubiquitination assay revealed that TRIM21 promotes ubiquitination.
Comparison of HIIT and MICT and further detraining on metabolic syndrome and asprosin signaling pathway in metabolic syndrome model of rats.,"Physical activity promotes various metabolic benefits by balancing pro and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Recent studies suggest that asprosin might be involved in progression of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the underlying mechanisms have not been understood yet. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), and further detraining on MetS indices, insulin resistance, serum and the liver levels of asprosin, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in menopause-induced MetS model of rats. A total of 64 Wistar rats were used in this study and divided into eight groups: Sham1, OVX1 (ovariectomized), Sham2, OVX2, OVX + HIIT, OVX + MICT, OVX + HIIT + Det (detraining), and OVX + MICT + Det. Animals performed the protocols, and then serum concentrations of asprosin, TNF-α, insulin, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profiles (TC, LDL, TG, and HDL) were assessed. Additionally, the liver expression of asprosin, AMPK, and P-AMPK was measured by western blotting. Both HIIT and MICT caused a significant decrease in weight, waist circumference, BMI (P = 0.001), and serum levels of glucose, insulin, asprosin (P = 0.001), triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and TNF-α (P = 0.001), but an increase in the liver AMPK, P-AMPK, and P-AMPK/AMPK (P = 0.001), compared with OVX2 noexercised group. MICT was superior to HIIT in reducing serum asprosin, TNF-a, TG, LDL (P = 0.001), insulin, fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR, and QUEKI index (P = 0.001), but an increase in the liver AMPK, and p-AMPK (P = 0.001). Although after two months of de-training almost all indices returned to the pre exercise values (P < 0.05). The findings suggest that MICT effectively alleviates MetS induced by menopause, at least partly through the activation of liver signaling of P-AMPK and the reduction of asprosin and TNF-α. These results have practical implications for the development of exercise interventions targeting MetS in menopausal individuals, emphasizing the potential benefits of MICT in mitigating MetS-related complications.",['Rahim HA; Damirchi A; Babaei P'],2024,"study aimed to evaluate effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on MetS indices, insulin resistance, serum and the liver levels of asprosin, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway.

Molecular and cellular consequences of mitochondrial DNA double-stranded breaks.,"Mitochondria are subcellular organelles essential for life. Beyond their role in producing energy, mitochondria govern various physiological mechanisms, encompassing energy generation, metabolic processes, apoptotic events, and immune responses. Mitochondria also contain genetic material that is susceptible to various forms of damage. Mitochondrial double-stranded breaks (DSB) are toxic lesions that the nucleus repairs promptly. Nevertheless, the significance of DSB repair in mammalian mitochondria is controversial. This review presents an updated view of the available research on the consequences of mitochondrial DNA DSB from the molecular to the cellular level. We discuss the crucial function of mitochondrial DNA damage in regulating processes such as senescence, integrated stress response, and innate immunity. Lastly, we discuss the potential role of mitochondrial DNA DSB in mediating the cellular consequences of ionizing radiations, the standard of care in treating solid tumors.",['Yu C; Asadian S; Tigano M'],2024,"mitochondrial DNA damage is controversial in mammalian mitochondria. mitochondrial DNA damage is crucial in regulating processes such as senescence, integrated stress response, and innate immunity."

The present study aims to offer a further contribute to the topic by presenting our personal experience with an implant-guided tailor-made mastopexy technique to manage moderate breast ptosis and hypotrophy. A retrospective analysis of our database was carried out, and a total of 194 women who underwent a tailor-made resection pattern mastopexy plus implant from November 2016 to December 2021 were enrolled. All patients included in the study presented breast hypoplasia and ptosis classified as Regnault grade II. At the first-year follow-up visit, patients received an anonymous written questionnaire that addressed their self-perception of cosmetic results and overall satisfaction. The technique presented in the study showed a favorable safety profile with a total complication rate accounting for an 8.2% and an overall reoperation rate as low as 4.6%. Major concerns including wound dehiscence, implant exposure, and nipple necrosis are not reported. Patients' self-reported outcomes revealed high satisfaction rates and stable results in the long-term follow-up.

LARS1 is a Prognostic Biomarker and Exhibits a Correlation with Immune Infiltrates in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"To study the relationship between LARS1 expression and immune infiltration and prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The clinical characteristics together with LARS1 expression levels were obtained from the TCGA database. Immunohistochemistry confirmed LARS1 expression levels in paraneoplastic and tumor tissues. To investigate LARS1-related downstream molecules, a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and the Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were built. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze the pathways associated with LARS1 expression, whereas Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) was applied to perform an association study between immune infiltration and LARS1 gene expression. The TISCH Database and the TISIDB database were used to compare the difference of LARS1 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and immunomodulators. In comparison to that in normal tissues, the LARS1 expression level was elevated in tumor tissues. LARS1 expression exhibited substantial correlation with AFP, Histologic grade, pathologic stage, Residual tumor, and Vascular invasion in HCC. Higher LARS1 expression in HCC was linked to lower progression-free survival (PFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). According to the GO/KEGG study, the important biological process (neutral lipid metabolic process), cellular component (triglyceride-rich plasma lipoprotein), molecular functions (lipase inhibitor activity), and KEGG pathway (cholesterol metabolism) could be a probable function mechanism in promoting HCC. Various pathways as per GSEA revealed that they were enriched in samples with elevated LARS1 expression. The expression level of LARS1 in malignant tumor cells after immunotherapy was significantly higher than that before immunotherapy. LARS1 was also remarkably linked to the infiltration level and the immunomodulators. LARS1 can be used as a biomarker of HCC, which is associated to immune infiltration of HCC.",['Fan L; Qin Z; Wu D; Yang Y; Zhang Y; Xie B; Qian J; Wei J; Wang Z; Yang P; Qian Z; Yuan M; Zhu Z; Tan Y; Tan Y'],2024,immunohistochemistry confirmed LARS1 expression levels in paraneoplastic and tumor tissues. a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and the Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were built.
You can't spell distress without stress: Expanding our perspective of the intersection between mental and physical health in cancer survivors.,"Although many breast cancer survivors adjust to cancer treatment and survivorship, a sizable subgroup of women do not do so, resulting in psychological distress.

A Two-Stage Training Framework Using Multicontrast MRI Radiomics for IDH Mutation Status Prediction in Glioma.,"<i>""Just Accepted"" papers have undergone full peer review and have been accepted for publication in <i>Radiology: Artificial Intelligence</i>. This article will undergo copyediting, layout, and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content.</i> Purpose To develop a radiomics framework for preoperative MRI-based prediction of <i>IDH</i> mutation status, a crucial glioma prognostic indicator. Materials and Methods Radiomics features (shape, first-order statistics, and texture) were extracted from the whole tumor or the combination of nonenhancing, necrosis, and edema regions. Segmentation masks were obtained via the federated tumor segmentation tool or the original data source. Boruta, a wrapper-based feature selection algorithm, identified relevant features. Addressing the imbalance between mutated and wild-type cases, multiple prediction models were trained on balanced data subsets using Random Forest or XGBoost and assembled to build the final classifier. The framework was evaluated using retrospective MRI scans from three public datasets (The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA, 227 patients), the University of California San Francisco Preoperative Diffuse Glioma MRI dataset (UCSF, 495 patients), and the Erasmus Glioma Database (EGD, 456 patients)) and internal datasets collected from UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW, 356 patients), New York University (NYU, 136 patients), and University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWM, 174 patients). TCIA and UTSW served as separate training sets, while the remaining data constituted the test set (1617 or 1488 testing cases, respectively). Results The best-performing models trained on the TCIA dataset achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.89 for UTSW, 0.86 for NYU, 0.93 for UWM, 0.94 for UCSF, and 0.88 for EGD test sets. The best-performing models trained on the UTSW dataset achieved slightly higher AUCs: 0.92 for TCIA, 0.88 for NYU, 0.96 for UWM, 0.93 for UCSF, and 0.90 for EGD.

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction in heart transplantation recipients.,"This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and risk factors of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (NCD) in patients who underwent heart transplantation. Seventy-six heart transplant patients were analyzed for clinical data including gender, age, height, weight, education level, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), stroke volume (SV), transplantation duration, and pretransplant medical history. Cognitive function was assessed using the mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) scales. Patients were categorized into cognitively normal and impaired groups based on the presence or absence of cognitive dysfunction, and their cognitive function scores were compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in postoperative cardiac transplant patients. Cognitive dysfunction was observed in 48 out of 76 heart transplant patients, representing an incidence of 63.2%. Cognitive impairment in heart transplant recipients predominantly affected multiple cognitive domains. Logistic regression analysis identified age (OR = 1.057, 95% CI 1.002-1.115), gender (OR = .200, 95% CI .044-.919), education level (OR = .728, 95% CI .600-.883), LVEF (OR = .891, 95% CI .820-.969), and history of diabetes (OR = 7.674, 95% CI 1.317-44.733) as independent risk factors for postoperative NCD in heart transplant recipients (P < .05). The study found a high incidence of postoperative NCD in heart transplant patients, with gender, age, education level, LVEF, and diabetes history being significant risk factors.

Type 2 diabetes in latin America: recommendations on the flash glucose monitoring system.,"To establish recommendations through the consensus of a Latin American experts panel on the use of the flash glucose monitoring system (fCGM) in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) regarding the benefits and challenges of using the fCGM. An executive committee of experts was created, comprised by a panel of fifteen physicians, including endocrinologists and internal medicine physicians, with expertise in management of adult patients with T2DM. The experts were from various countries: Colombia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. The modified Delphi method was used, considering a consensus level of at least 80% of the participants. A seventeen-item instrument was developed to establish recommendations on the use of fCGM in patients with T2DM in Latin American. The number of glucose scans recommended per day with the fCGM for patients managed with oral antidiabetic drugs or basal insulin was a median of 6 scans per day, and for those managed with multiple insulin doses, a median of 10 scans per day was recommended. Additionally, a holistic and individualized management approach was recommended, taking into account new treatment directions and identifying patients who would benefit from the use of the fCGM.

Environmental enrichment and the combined interventions of EE and metformin enhance hippocampal neuron survival and hippocampal-dependent memory in type 2 diabetic rats under stress through the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathways.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) with depression causes severe cognitive impairments. The devastating conditions will further compromise the overall quality of life. The overconsumption of high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet is one of the modifiable risk factors for T2D, depression, and cognitive impairments. Thus, it is essential to identify effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the cognitive impairments in T2D with depression. We proposed environmental enrichment (EE) which encompasses social, cognitive, and physical components as the alternative treatment for such impairments. We also investigated the potential neuroprotective properties of the antidiabetic drug metformin. This study aimed to investigate the effects of EE and metformin interventions on hippocampal neuronal death, and hippocampal-dependent memory impairment in T2D rats under stress. Thirty-two male rats (200-250 g) were divided into four groups: C group (standard diet + conventional cage), DS group [HFS-induced T2D + restraint stress (RS)], DSE group [HFS-induced T2D + RS + EE] and DSEM group [HFS + RS + EE + metformin]. Serum corticosterone (CORT) was measured to evaluate stress levels. The serum Free Oxygen Radicals Testing (FORT) and Free Oxygen Radicals Defence Test (FORD) were measured to evaluate the systemic oxidative status (OS). Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and T-maze tasks were performed to evaluate cognitive functions. Rats were humanely sacrificed to collect brains for histological, morphometric, and hippocampal gene expression studies. The CORT and the serum FORT levels in the DSE and DSEM groups were lower than in the DS group. Meanwhile, the serum BDNF, T-maze scores, histological, and morphometric analysis were improved in the DSE and DSEM groups than in the DS group. These findings supported that EE and the combined interventions of EE and metformin had neuroprotective properties. The hippocampal gene expression analysis revealed that the DSE and DSEM groups showed improved regulation of BDNF-TrkB signalling pathways, including the BDNF/TrkB binding, PI3K - Akt pathway, Ras-MAPK pathway, PLCγ-Ca2+ pathway, and CREB transcription. EE and the combined interventions of EE and metformin improved hippocampal neuron survival and hippocampal-dependent memory in T2D rats under stress by enhancing gene expression regulation of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.",['Ismail TR; Yap CG; Naidu R; Shri L; Pamidi N'],2024,type 2 diabetes (T2D) with depression causes severe cognitive impairments. the devastating conditions will further compromise the overall quality of life.
The development of an EU-wide nutrition and physical activity expert knowledge base to support a personalised mobile application across various EU population groups.,"A healthy lifestyle comprising regular physical activity and an adequate diet is imperative for the prevention of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and some cancers. Advances in information computer technology offer the opportunity to provide personalised lifestyle advice directly to the individual through devices such as smartphones or tablets. The overall aim of the PROTEIN project (Wilson-Barnes et al., 2021) was to develop a smartphone application that could provide tailored and dynamic nutrition and physical activity advice directly to the individual in real time. However, to create this mobile health (m-health) smartphone application, a knowledge base of reference ranges for macro-/micronutrient intake, anthropometry, biochemical, physiological and sleep parameters was required to underpin the parameters of the recommender systems. Therefore, the principal aim of this emerging research paper is to describe the process by which experts in nutrition and physiology from the PROTEIN consortium collaborated to develop the nutritional and physical activity requirements, based upon existing recommendations, for 10 separate population groups living within the EU including, but not limited to healthy adults, adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, excess weight, obesity and iron deficiency anaemia. A secondary aim is to describe the development of a library of 24-h meal plans appropriate for the same groups and also encompassing various dietary preferences and allergies. Overall, the consortium devised an extensive nutrition and physical activity knowledge base that is pertinent to 10 separate EU user groups, is available in 7 different languages and is practically implemented via a library of culturally appropriate, 24-h meal plans.",['Wilson-Barnes SL; Pagkalos I; Patra E; Kokkinopoulou A; Hassapidou M; Lalama E; Csanalosi M; Kabisch S; Pfeiffer AFH; DeCorte E; Cornelissen V; Bacelar P; Balula Dias S; Stefanidis K; Tsatsou D; Gymnopoulos L; Dimitropoulos K; Rouskas K; Argiriou N; Leoni R; Botana JM; Russell D; Lanham-New SA; Hart K'],2024,"the aim of the PROTEIN project was to develop a smartphone application that could provide tailored and dynamic nutrition and physical activity advice directly to the individual. the project was to develop a knowledge base of reference ranges for macro-/micronutrient intake, anthropometry, biochemical, physiological and sleep parameters."

Oral Drug Dosing After Gastric Bypass and Diet-Induced Weight Loss: Simpler Than We Think? Lessons Learned From the COCKTAIL Study.,"This article summarizes the lessons learned from the COCKTAIL study: an open, three-armed, single-center study including patients with obesity scheduled for treatment with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or nonsurgical calorie restriction, and a normal- to overweight control group. The clinical implications of the results from multiple peer-reviewed articles describing the effects of RYGB, severe caloric restriction, weight loss, and type 2 diabetes on the in vivo activity and protein expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A) and transporters (DMETs; organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)) are discussed in the perspective of three clinically relevant questions: (1) How should clinicians get the dose right in patients after RYGB? (2) Will drug disposition in patients with obesity be normalized after successful weight loss? (3) Are dose adjustments needed according to obesity and diabetes status? Overall, RYGB seems to have a lower impact on drug disposition than previously assumed, but clinicians should pay close attention to drugs with a narrow therapeutic range or where a high maximum drug concentration may be problematic. Whether obesity-related alterations of DMETs normalize with substantial weight loss depends on the DMET in question. Obesity and diabetes downregulate the in vivo activity of CYP2C19 and CYP3A (only obesity) but whether substrate drugs should be dose adjusted is also dependent on other factors that influence clearance, that is, liver blood flow and protein binding.

Assessment of genetic and clinical factors in T2D susceptibility among patients with hypertension.,"Hypertension (HTN) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) often coexist, therefore understanding the relationship between both diseases is imperative to guide targeted prevention/therapy. This study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D using genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis and biochemical data to understand the implication of both clinical and genetic factors in these pathologies. A total of 2,876 patients were enrolled. Using GWAS and biochemical data, patients with both T2D and HTN were compared to patients with only HTN. Specificity was confirmed by testing the detected genetic variants for associations with HTN development in T2D patients, or with HTN in healthy subjects. Regression models were applied to examine the association of T2D in patients with HTN with cardiovascular risk factors. Replication was performed using UK Biobank dataset with 31,170 subjects. Data showed that females with HTN are at higher risk of developing T2D due to dyslipidemia, while males faced higher risk due to high BMI (body mass index) and family history of T2D. GWAS identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to T2D in patients with HTN. Notably, rs7865889, rs7756992, and rs10896290 were positively associated with T2D, whereas rs12737517 yielded negative association. Three SNPs were replicated in the UK Biobank (rs10896290, rs7865889, and rs7756992). Incorporating clinical and genetic screening into risk assessment is important for the detection and prevention of T2D in patients with HTN. The detected SNPs (rs7865889, rs12737517, and rs10896290), especially the protective SNP (rs12737517), provide an opportunity for better diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of patients with T2D and HTN.","[""Al Hageh C; O'Sullivan S; Henschel A; Chacar S; Hantouche M; Nader M; Zalloua PA""]",2024,"study aims to explore the relationship between HTN and T2D.

TAZ is involved in breast cancer cell migration via regulating actin dynamics.,"Cancer metastasis is dependent on cell migration. Several mechanisms, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and actin fiber formation, could be involved in cancer cell migration. As a downstream effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is recognized as a key mediator of the metastatic ability of breast cancer cells. We aimed to examine whether TAZ affects the migration of breast cancer cells through the regulation of EMT or actin cytoskeleton. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with siRNA to attenuate TAZ abundance. Transwell migration assay and scratch wound healing assay were performed to study the effects of TAZ knockdown on cancer cell migration. Fluorescence microscopy was conducted to examine the vinculin and phalloidin. Semiquantitative immunoblotting and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to study the expression of small GTPases and kinases. Changes in the expression of genes associated with cell migration were examined through next-generation sequencing. TAZ-siRNA treatment reduced TAZ abundance in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which was associated with a significant decrease in cell migration. TAZ knockdown increased the expression of fibronectin, but it did not exhibit the typical pattern of EMT progression. TGF-β treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a reduction in TAZ and an increase in fibronectin levels. However, it paradoxically promoted cell migration, suggesting that EMT is unlikely to be involved in the decreased migration of breast cancer cells in response to TAZ suppression. RhoA, a small Rho GTPase protein, was significantly reduced in response to TAZ knockdown. This caused a decrease in the expression of the Rho-dependent downstream pathway, i.e., LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1), phosphorylated LIMK1/2, and phosphorylated cofilin, leading to actin depolymerization. Furthermore, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and phosphorylated MLC2 were significantly decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells with TAZ knockdown, inhibiting the assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions. TAZ knockdown inhibits the migration of breast cancer cells by regulating the intracellular actin cytoskeletal organization. This is achieved, in part, by reducing the abundance of RhoA and Rho-dependent downstream kinase proteins, which results in actin depolymerization and the disassembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions.",['Choi HS; Jang HJ; Kristensen MK; Kwon TH'],2024,"tumor metastasis is dependent on cell migration. several mechanisms, including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and actin fiber formation, could be involved in cancer cell migration."
Intravenous iron and iron deficiency anemia in patients with gastrointestinal cancer: A systematic review.,"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent hematological complication associated with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers due to an increased loss of iron and decreased iron absorption. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the use of parenteral iron to treat IDA in patients with GI cancer. PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, CINHAL and Scopus were searched from January 1, 2010 to September 29, 2023 with no language restrictions. We excluded editorials, case reports, abstracts, conference papers, and poster presentations. Studies were included if they discussed IDA, GI neoplasms, use of iron supplementation (with or without erythropoietin-stimulating agents [ESAs]), defined anemia and had an adult patient population. We assessed the efficacy of parenteral iron in comparison to other iron supplementation methods when treating IDA in patients with GI cancer. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2 (RoB 2) and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) assessment tools were used to assess the quality of the included studies. Moreover, the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization data collection form was used to collect pertinent study information. Our search yielded 3,969 studies across all databases. Twenty-one studies were included (6 randomized control trials; 15 non-randomized studies). Of the 15 studies evaluating hemoglobin (Hb) response, seven studies found an increase in Hb levels when patients were treated with IV iron. The 14 studies evaluating red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rates found conflicting differences in RBC transfusion needs when treated with IV iron. Studies analyzing health related outcomes typically found an increase in quality of life and decreased post-operative complications. This review demonstrates improved outcomes of IDA in patients with GI cancer treated with IV iron instead of other iron supplementation methods. Timely diagnosis and appropriate IDA management can greatly improve quality of life in this patient population, especially if myelosuppressive chemotherapy is required.",['Nandakumar S; Singh N; Tharani AR; Pankiw M; Brezden-Masley C'],2024,"study was conducted from January 1, 2010 to September 29, 2023. study included if discussed IDA, GI neoplasms, use of iron supplementation. study included a study of GI cancer, GI neoplasms, use of iron supplementation."
NSUN2 affects diabetic retinopathy progression by regulating MUC1 expression through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blinding eye disease among working adults and is primarily attributed to the excessive proliferation of microvessels, which leads to vitreous hemorrhage and retinal traction, thereby significantly impairing patient vision. NSUN2-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation is implicated in various diseases, and in this investigation, we focused on elucidating the impact of NSUN2 on the regulation of the expression of the downstream gene MUC1, specifically through RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, on the progression of DR. Utilizing Microarray analysis, we examined patient vitreous fluid to pinpoint potential therapeutic targets for DR. Differential expression of NSUN2 was validated through qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence in human tissue, animal tissue, and cell model of DR. The relationship between NSUN2 and DR was explored in vitro and in vivo through gene knockdown and overexpression. Various techniques, such as MeRIP-qPCR and dot blot, were applied to reveal the downstream targets and mechanism of action of NSUN2. The levels of both NSUN2 and RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation were significantly elevated in the DR model. Knockdown of NSUN2 mitigated DR lesion formation both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NSUN2 promoted MUC1 expression by binding to the RNA m<sup>5</sup>C reader ALYREF. Knockdown of ALYREF resulted in DR lesion alterations similar to those observed with NSUN2 knockdown. Moreover, MUC1 overexpression successfully reversed a series of DR alterations induced by NSUN2 silencing. NSUN2 regulates the expression of MUC1 through ALYREF-mediated RNA m<sup>5</sup>C methylation, thereby regulating the progression of DR and providing a new option for the treatment of DR in the future.",['Wang R; Xue W; Kan F; Zhang H; Wang D; Wang L; Wang J'],2024,"NSUN2 is involved in various diseases, including retinopathy.

Non-contrast Breast MR Imaging.,"Considering the high cost of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and various contraindications and health concerns related to administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents, there is emerging interest in non-contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging. Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) is a fast, unenhanced technique that has wide clinical applications in breast cancer detection, characterization, prognosis, and predicting treatment response. It also has the potential to serve as a non-contrast MR imaging screening method. Standardized protocols and interpretation strategies can help to enhance the clinical utility of breast DWI. A variety of other promising non-contrast MR imaging techniques are in development, but currently, DWI is closest to clinical integration, while others are still mostly used in the research setting.",['Kim JY; Partridge SC'],2024,"non-contrast-enhanced breast MR imaging is a fast, unenhanced technique. it has wide clinical applications in breast cancer detection, characterization, prognosis, and predicting treatment response. standardized protocols and interpretation strategies can help to enhance the clinical utility of breast DWI."
Defective natriuresis contributes to hyperkalemia in db/db mice during potassium supplementation.,"Potassium supplementation reduces blood pressure and the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, with K+-induced natriuresis playing a potential key role in this process. However, whether these beneficial effects occur in diabetes remains unknown. In this study, we examined the impact of high-K+ intake on renal Na+/K+ transport by determining the expression of major apical Na+ transporters, diuretics responses (as a proxy for specific Na+ transporter function), urinary Na+/K+ excretion, and plasma Na+/K+ concentrations in db/db mice, a model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although db/m mice exhibited increased fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) and fractional excretion of potassium (FEK) under high-K+ intake, these responses were largely blunted in db/db mice, suggesting impaired K+-induced natriuresis and kaliuresis in diabetes. Consequently, high-K+ intake increased plasma K+ levels in db/db mice, which could be attributed to the abnormal activity of sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3), sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC), and epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), as high-K+ intake could not effectively decrease NHE3 and NCC and increase ENaC expression and activity in the diabetic group. Inhibition of NCC by hydrochlorothiazide could correct the hyperkalemia in db/db mice fed a high-K+ diet, indicating a key role for NCC in K+-loaded diabetic mice. Treatment with metformin enhanced urinary Na+/K+ excretion and normalized plasma K+ levels in db/db mice with a high-K+ diet, at least partially, by suppressing NCC activity. Collectively, the impaired K+-induced natriuresis in diabetic mice under high-K+ intake may be primarily attributed to impaired NCC-mediated renal K+ excretion, despite the role of NHE3.",['Shu TT; Gao ZX; Mao ZH; Yang YY; Fu WJ; Pan SK; Zhao QQ; Liu DW; Liu ZS; Wu P'],2024,high-K+ intake increases plasma K+ levels in db/db mice. this could be attributed to abnormal activity of NHE3 and NCC. high-K+ intake could not effectively decrease NHE3 and NCC.

Surgical complications and technical failure of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation: A 22-year experience from a single center.,"Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) is the best treatment for selected individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. Despite advances in surgical techniques, donor and recipient selection, and immunosuppressive therapies, SPKT remains a complex procedure with associated surgical complications and adverse consequences. We conducted a retrospective study that included 263 SPKT procedures performed between May 2000, and December 2022. A total of 65 patients (25%) required at least one relaparotomy, resulting in an all-cause relaparotomy rate of 2.04 events per 100 in-hospital days. Lower donor body mass index was identified as an independent factor associated with reoperation (OR .815; 95% CI:  .725-.917, p = .001). Technical failure (TF) occurred in 9.9% of cases, primarily attributed to pancreas graft thrombosis, intra-abdominal infections, bleeding, and anastomotic leaks. Independent predictors of TF at 90 days included donor age above 36 years (HR 2.513; 95% CI 1.162-5.434), previous peritoneal dialysis (HR 2.503; 95% CI 1.149-5.451), and specific pancreas graft reinterventions. The findings highlight the importance of carefully considering donor and recipient factors in SPKT. The incidence of TF in our study population aligns with the recent series. Continuous efforts should focus on identifying and mitigating potential risk factors to enhance SPKT outcomes, thereby reducing post-transplant complications.",['Dias BF; Marques RC; Cardoso C; Faria V; Domingues P; Ribeiro C; Silvano J; Silva D; Pedroso S; Almeida M; Malheiro J; Martins S'],2024,"a retrospective study included 263 SPKT procedures performed between May 2000, and December 2022. a total of 65 patients (25%) required at least one relaparotomy. the results highlight the importance of carefully considering donor and recipient factors in SPKT."
Evaluation of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in liver cells' cultures by MEKC: Initial hints to comprehend its role in diabetes mellitus of obese individuals.,"Genetic factors, diet, lifestyle, and other factors lead to various complications in the body, such as obesity and other chronic diseases. The inflammatory state caused by excessive accumulation of body fat affects the pathways related to the control of glycemic homeostasis, leading to a high demand for insulin, to subsequent failure of stressed β cells, and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study of new endocrine signalers, such as bile acids (BAs), becomes necessary as it allows the development of alternatives for T2DM treatment. In this work, a methodology was developed to quantify tauroursodeoxycholic BA (TUDCA) in liver cells of the HepG2 strain treated in hyperlipidic medium. This BA helps to improve insulin clearance by increasing the expression of the insulin-degrading enzyme, restoring sensitivity to this hormone, and making it viable for treating T2DM. Herein, a targeted metabolomic method for TUDCA determination in extracellular medium of hepatocyte matrices by micellar electrokinetic chromatography-UV was optimized, validated, and applied. The optimized background electrolyte was composed of 40 mmol/L sodium cholate and 30 mmol/L sodium tetraborate at pH 9.0. The following figures of merit were evaluated: linearity, limit of quantification, limit of detection, accuracy, and precision. Data obtained with the validated electrophoretic method showed a self-stimulation of TUDCA production in media supplemented only with BA. On the other hand, TUDCA concentration was reduced in the hyperlipidic medium. This suggests that, in these media, the effect of TUDCA is reduced, such as self-stimulated production and consequent regulation of glycemic homeostasis. Therefore, the results reinforce the need for investigating TUDCA as a potential T2DM biomarker as well as its use to treat several comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus.",['Simões BES; Muniz MRR; Araujo TD; Magalhães Carneiro E; Simionato AVC'],2024,"inflammatory state caused by excessive accumulation of body fat affects pathways related to control of glycemic homeostasis. inflammatory state causes high demand for insulin, failure of stressed  cells, and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)"

Mind the gap in kidney care: Translating what we know into what we do.,"Historically, it takes an average of 17 years to move new treatments from clinical evidence to daily practice. Given the highly effective treatments now available to prevent or delay kidney disease onset and progression, this is far too long. The time is now to narrow the gap between what we know and what we do. Clear guidelines exist for the prevention and management of common risk factors for kidney disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, but only a fraction of people with these conditions worldwide are diagnosed, and even fewer are treated to target. Similarly, the vast majority of people living with kidney disease are unaware of their condition, because in the early stages it is often silent. Even among patients who have been diagnosed, many do not receive appropriate treatment for kidney disease. Considering the serious consequences of kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or death, it is imperative that treatments are initiated early and appropriately. Opportunities to diagnose and treat kidney disease early must be maximized beginning at the primary care level. Many systematic barriers exist, ranging from patient to clinician to health systems to societal factors. To preserve and improve kidney health for everyone everywhere, each of these barriers must be acknowledged so that sustainable solutions are developed and implemented without further delay.",['Luyckx VA; Tuttle KR; Abdellatif D; Correa-Rotter R; Fung WWS; Haris A; Hsiao LL; Khalife M; Kumaraswami LA; Loud F; Raghavan V; Roumeliotis S; Sierra M; Ulasi I; Wang B; Lui SF; Liakopoulos V; Balducci A'],2024,"a fraction of people with kidney disease worldwide are diagnosed. many do not receive appropriate treatment for kidney disease. many systematic barriers exist, from patient to clinician to health systems."
Gastric cancer immune microenvironment score predicts neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy and prognosis.,"The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) varies greatly. Thus, we aimed to verify the predictive value of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) on the treatment response to NACT and the prognosis of patients with advanced GC, and to explore the impact of NACT on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Paired tumor tissues (pre- and post-NACT) from patients with advanced GC were collected for this study. TIICs were assessed using immunohistochemistry staining and analyzed using logistic regression to establish an immune microenvironment score for GC (ISGC score) and predict NACT efficacy. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the survival outcome of patients. The results showed that TIME was dramatically heterogeneous between NACT response and nonresponse patients. In the validation cohort, the ISGC score demonstrated good predictive performance for treatment response to NACT. Moreover, high ISGC indicated better long-term survival in patients with advanced GC. Furthermore, tumor-infiltrated T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>) and CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages were significantly increased in the response group, while CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages and FOXP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells were decreased after NACT. However, opposite results were exhibited in the nonresponse group. Finally, we found that the percentage of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors was 31% (32/104) pre-NACT and 49% (51/104) post-NACT, and almost all patients with elevated PD-L1 were in the NACT response group. The ISGC model accurately predicted NACT efficacy and classified patients with GC into different survival groups. NACT regulates the TIME in GC, which may provide strategies for personalized immunotherapy.",['Zhao S; Liu Y; Ding L; Zhang C; Ye J; Sun K; Song W; Cai S; He Y; Peng J; Xu J'],2024,neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) varies greatly. we aimed to verify the predictive value of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) on the treatment response to NACT and the prognosis of patients with advanced GC.

Association of Lipoprotein (a) and Standard Modifiable Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Incident Myocardial Infarction: The Mass General Brigham Lp(a) Registry.,"Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is a robust predictor of coronary heart disease outcomes, with targeted therapies currently under investigation. We aimed to evaluate the association of high Lp(a) with standard modifiable risk factors (SMuRFs) for incident first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This retrospective study used the Mass General Brigham Lp(a) Registry, which included patients aged ≥18 years with an Lp(a) measurement between 2000 and 2019. Exclusion criteria were severe kidney dysfunction, malignant neoplasm, and prior known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking were considered SMuRFs. High Lp(a) was defined as >90th percentile, and low Lp(a) was defined as <50th percentile. The primary outcome was fatal or nonfatal AMI. A combination of natural language processing algorithms, <i>International Classification of Diseases</i> (<i>ICD</i>) codes, and laboratory data was used to identify the outcome and covariates. A total of 6238 patients met the eligibility criteria. The median age was 54 (interquartile range, 43-65) years, and 45% were women. Overall, 23.7% had no SMuRFs, and 17.8% had ≥3 SMuRFs. Over a median follow-up of 8.8 (interquartile range, 4.2-12.8) years, the incidence of AMI increased gradually, with higher number of SMuRFs among patients with high (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.031) and low Lp(a) (log-rank <i>P</i><0.001). Across all SMuRF subgroups, the incidence of AMI was significantly higher for patients with high Lp(a) versus low Lp(a). The risk of high Lp(a) was similar to having 2 SMuRFs. Following adjustment for confounders and number of SMuRFs, high Lp(a) remained significantly associated with the primary outcome (hazard ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.0-4.3]; <i>P</i><0.001).

Dopamine Inhibits the Expression of Hepatitis B Virus Surface and e Antigens by Activating the JAK/STAT Pathway and Upregulating Interferon-stimulated Gene 15 Expression.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for cirrhosis and liver cancer, and its treatment continues to be difficult. We previously demonstrated that a dopamine analog inhibited the packaging of pregenomic RNA into capsids. The present study aimed to determine the effect of dopamine on the expressions of hepatitis B virus surface and e antigens (HBsAg and HBeAg, respectively) and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. We used dopamine-treated HBV-infected HepG2.2.15 and NTCP-G2 cells to monitor HBsAg and HBeAg expression levels. We analyzed interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) expression in dopamine-treated cells. We knocked down ISG15 and then monitored HBsAg and HBeAg expression levels. We analyzed the expression of Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway factors in dopamine-treated cells. We used dopamine hydrochloride-treated adeno-associated virus/HBV-infected mouse model to evaluate HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg expression. HBV virus was collected from HepAD38.7 cell culture medium. Dopamine inhibited HBsAg and HBeAg expression and upregulated ISG15 expression in HepG2.2.15 and HepG2-NTCP cell lines. ISG15 knockdown increased HBsAg and HBeAg expression in HepG2.2.15 cells. Dopamine-treated cells activated the JAK/STAT pathway, which upregulated ISG15 expression. In the adeno-associated virus-HBV murine infection model, dopamine downregulated HBsAg and HBeAg expression and activated the JAK-STAT/ISG15 axis.

<i>Kcnma1</i> alternative splicing in mouse kidney: regulation during development and by dietary K<sup>+</sup> intake.,"The pore-forming α subunit of the large conductance potassium (BK) channel is encoded by a single gene, <i>KCNMA1.</i> BK channel-mediated K<sup>+</sup> secretion in the kidney is crucial for overall renal K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in both physiological and pathological conditions. BK channels achieve phenotypic diversity by various mechanisms, including substantial exon re-arrangements at seven major alternative splicing sites. However, <i>KCNMA1</i> alternative splicing in the kidney has not been characterized. The current study aims to identify the major splice variants of mouse <i>Kcnma1</i> in whole kidney and distal nephron segments.

Knockdown of YTHDF2 initiates ERS-induced apoptosis and cancer stemness suppression by sustaining GLI2 stability in cervical cancer.,"Cervical cancer ranks fourth in women in terms of incidence and mortality. The RNA-binding protein YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein F2 (YTHDF2) contributes to cancer progression by incompletely understood mechanisms. We show how YTHDF2 controls the fate of cervical cancer cells and whether YTHDF2 could be a valid target for the therapy of cervical cancer. Sphere formation and alkaline phosphatase staining assays were performed to evaluate tumor stemness of cervical cancer cells following YTHDF2 knockdown. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The compounds 4PBA and SP600125 were used to investigate the correlation between JNK, endoplasmic reticulum stress, tumor stemness, and apoptosis. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) revealed that GLI family zinc finger 2 (GLI2) might be the target of YTHDF2. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were employed to investigate the association between the GLI2 mRNA and YTHDF2. Nude mouse xenografts were generated to assess the effects of YTHDF2 knockdown on cervical cancer growth in vivo. Knockdown of YTHDF2 up-regulated the expression of GLI2, leading to JNK phosphorylation and endoplasmic reticulum stress. These processes inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cells and their tumor cell stemness and promotion of apoptosis. In conclusion, the knockdown of YTHDF2 significantly affects the progression of cervical cancer cells, making it a potential target for treating cervical cancer.",['Wan F; Qiu F; Deng Y; Hu H; Zhang Y; Zhang JY; Kuang P; Tian H; Wu D; Min H; Li J; Xu J; Zhou J'],2024,YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA-binding protein F2 contributes to cancer progression.

"Chemo-profiling and exploring therapeutic potential of Momordica dioica Roxb. ex Willd. for managing metabolic related disorders: In-vitro studies, and docking based approach.","Momordica dioica Roxb. ex Willd. (M. dioica Roxb.) a nutritious and therapeutic property rich crop of Cucurbitaceae plant family. In various folklore medicine including Ayurveda fruits are used to treat several metabolic related disorders i.e., hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity etc. Furthermore, traditionally it is used to treat fever, inflammation, ulcer, skin diseases, haemorrhoids, hypertension and also employed as cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, analgesic, diuretic. This study focuses to explore the therapeutic potential of Momordica dioica Roxb. ex Willd. through in-vitro and in-silico approach for managing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and related metabolic disorders along with its phytochemical profiling for quality evaluation and validation of traditional claim. The present study was carried out on hydroalcohol extract of dried leaf and fruit of Momordica dioica. In-vitro antioxidant potential using DPPH and Nitric oxide scavenging assay along with in-vitro enzyme inhibitory potential against α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase enzymes was studied. The bioactive metabolites were identified from the most potent bioactive extract by analysis with LC-QTOF-MS and also studied their role to lessen the metabolic related disorder through in-silico approaches. The results confirmed that the fruit extract is more active to possess antioxidant and prominent enzyme inhibition potential compared to the leaf. Sixteen identified metabolites in M. dioica Roxb. fruits may be responsible for the therapeutic potential related to metabolic related disorder. The in-silico study of the identified phytomolecules against α-amylase, α-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase showed significant docking scores ranging from -9.8 to -5.5, -8.3 to -4.8 and -8.3 to -6 respectively.

Influence of cachexia on immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis for malignant tumors of the digestive system.,"The presence of cancer cachexia is a significant adverse prognostic indicator in patients with malignant tumors. Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by a constant loss of skeletal muscles with or without a loss of weight, leading to immune dysfunction. We performed a retrospective study to investigate the influence of cachexia on the immunotherapy efficacy and prognosis for malignant tumors of the digestive system. The present study adopts a cross-sectional design. The prognosis data of patients with advanced cancer of the digestive system who received immunotherapy from September 2021 to December 2022 were analyzed. Cachexia was calculated using the change of the area of the psoas major muscle (PMMA) or the weight. We measured the change at the beginning of immunotherapy and at least 2 cycles afterward. The participants were categorized into the cachexia group and control group based on the evaluation criteria. Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank methods were used for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazard model as a method to assess the contribution of different clinical factors to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A total number of 98 patients, including esophageal carcinoma (4, 4%), gastric (36, 37%), colorectal (51, 52%), and other cancer types (7, 7%), were enrolled. Fifty-four patients were diagnosed with non-cancer cachexia, and the cancer cachexia group included 44 patients. The median PFS in the cachexia group was shorter than that in the control group (130 days vs. 212 days). Their difference was not significant (p = .321). The survival rate of the patients without cachexia was longer than of those with cachexia (p = .027). The level of albumin and the number of metastatic organs were related to PFS (p = .020, p = .029). The albumin level was significantly associated with the OS of patients (p = .003). The presence of cachexia was significantly associated with poor OS in patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system who received immunotherapy, not with PFS or the response to immunotherapy.",['Tao Z; Chen Z; Gao Y; Quan M'],2024,cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by a constant loss of skeletal muscles with or without a loss of weight. the prognosis data of patients with advanced cancer of the digestive system who received immunotherapy from September 2021 to December 2022 were analyzed.
Canonical and noncanonical contribution of thyroid hormone receptor isoforms alpha and beta to cardiac hypertrophy and heart rate in male mice.,"Stimulation of ventricular hypertrophy and heart rate are two major cardiac effects of thyroid hormone (TH). Aim of this study was to determine in vivo which TH receptor (TR), α or β, and which mode of TR action, canonical gene expression or DNA binding independent noncanonical action, mediate these effects. We compared global TRα and TRβ knockout mice (TRα<sup>KO</sup>; TRβ<sup>KO</sup>) with wild-type (WT) mice to determine the TR isoform responsible for T3 effects. The relevance of TR DNA binding was studied in mice with a mutation in the DNA-binding domain that selectively abrogates DNA binding and canonical TR action (TRα<sup>GS</sup>; TRβ<sup>GS</sup>). Hearts were studied with echocardiography at baseline and after seven weeks T3 treatment. Gene expression was measured with real-time PCR. Heart rate was recorded with radiotelemetry transmitters for seven weeks in untreated, hypothyroid and T3-treated mice. T3 induced ventricular hypertrophy in WT and TRβ<sup>KO</sup> mice, but not in TRα<sup>KO</sup> mice. Hypertrophy was also induced in TRα<sup>GS</sup> mice. Thus, hypertrophy is mostly mediated by noncanonical TRα action. Similarly, repression of <i>Mhy7</i> occurred in WT and TRα<sup>GS</sup> mice. Basal heart rate was largely dependent on canonical TRα action. But responsiveness to hypothyroidism and T3 treatment as well as expression of pacemaker gene <i>Hcn2</i> were still preserved in TRα<sup>KO</sup> mice, demonstrating that TRβ could compensate for absence of TRα. T3-induced cardiac hypertrophy could be attributed to noncanonical TRα action, whereas heart rate regulation was mediated by canonical TRα action. TRβ could substitute for canonical, but not noncanonical TRα action.",['Geist D; Hönes GS; Grund SC; Pape J; Siemes D; Spangenberg P; Tolstik E; Dörr S; Spielmann N; Fuchs H; Gailus-Durner V; Hrabe de Angelis M; Mittag J; Engel DR; Führer D; Lorenz K; Moeller LC'],2024,"ventricular hypertrophy and heart rate are two major cardiac effects of thyroid hormone (TH). aim of this study was to determine in vivo which TH receptor (TR),  or, and which mode of TR action, canonical gene expression or DNA binding independent noncanonical action, mediate these effects."
Association between Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists Exposure and Intraocular Pressure Change.,"This study aims to provide data on the effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on intraocular pressure (IOP). Retrospective cohort study. 1247 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 626 patients who were initiated on GLP-1R agonists compared to 1083 glaucoma surgery and treatment naïve eyes of 547 patients who were initiated on other oral antidiabetics. The University of California Health Data Warehouse was queried for patients exposed to GLP-1R agonists or other oral antidiabetics. Index date was defined as the date of first exposure to the medication. Eyes with at least one pre-exposure and one post-exposure tonometry record within 365 days of the index date were included in the analysis. Clinical and laboratory data elements were extracted from the database. Eyes were censored from the analysis upon exposure to glaucoma hypotensive medication or glaucoma surgery. ΔIOP was analyzed using a paired t-test. Regression analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations (GEE) accounting for inter-eye correlation. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Primary outcome measure was ΔIOP after exposure to the medication. The median age of all included subjects was 66.2 years [IQR=18.3]; 607 (51.7%) were female, and 667 (56.9%) were Caucasian. Median pre-exposure IOP, HbA1c, and BMI were 15.2 mmHg [IQR=3.8], 7.5 [IQR=2.4], and 29.8 [IQR=9.4], respectively. 776 individuals (66.1%) had diabetes, with the median number of active oral antidiabetics being 1.0 [IQR=1.0], and 441 (37.5%) being insulin users. Several pre-exposure characteristics significantly differed between the GLP-1R agonist and the control group. The mean ΔIOP was -0.4±2.8 mmHg (paired t-test p<0.001) and -0.2±3.3 mmHg (paired t-test p = 0.297) in the GLP-1R agonist and other antidiabetics groups, respectively. Pre-exposure IOP was the only independent predictor of ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. Although GLP-1R agonists were significantly associated with a decrease in IOP in the paired analysis, they were not associated with ΔIOP in multivariable GEE. Moreover, the difference between the ΔIOP in the two groups was small. Future prospective studies following a standardized dose and delivery method may provide further insights.",['Hallaj S; Halfpenny W; Chuter BG; Weinreb RN; Baxter SL; Cui QN'],2024,1247 glaucoma surgery and treatment nave eyes of 626 patients compared to 1083 glaucoma surgery and treatment nave eyes of 547 patients. index date was defined as the date of first exposure to the medication. eyes with at least one pre-exposure and one post-exposure tonometry record within 365 days of the index date were included in the analysis.
Rediscovery of mononuclear phagocyte system blockade for nanoparticle drug delivery.,"Rapid uptake of nanoparticles by mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) significantly hampers their therapeutic efficacy.

"Prevalence of Neurological Symptoms and Imaging Findings in Von Hippel-Lindau Patients Referred to Rasool Akram Hospital, 2018-2021.","This study aimed to assess the prevalence of neurological symptoms and related imaging findings in patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) at Rasool Akram Hospital from September 2018 to September 2021. This analytical observational study examined eligible patients over the period from September 2018 to September 2021. We collected demographic information (age, gender) along with imaging findings and results of neurological and eye examinations. Comparison between qualitative variables was also done using the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Also, an independent <i>t</i>-test was used to compare quantitative variables between the two groups. SPSS version 22 software was used for statistical analysis of data. A significant level was considered less than or equal to 0.05. Of the 54 examined patients (48.1% were male and 51.9% were female) with an average age of 36.42 ± 13.37 years. A significant majority (87.0%) reported a positive family history of the disease. The most common type of disease was Type 1 observed in 94.4% of cases and Type 2A was the next most frequent (3.7%). The most common pattern of retinal pathological lesions seen in the examination was related to bilateral lesions (79.6%). The most common pathological finding was related to the presence of a mass in cerebellar magnetic resonance imaging (48.1%). Considering the findings of the present study, which highlight a significant frequency of bilateral retinal lesions as well as masses in the central nervous system and endocrine system, it is evident that patients require careful follow-up and various interventions after being diagnosed with the disease.

Penile-scrotal erythrodysesthesia among rectal cancer patients receiving fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation: a case report series.,"Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) is a slowly developing cutaneous reaction commonly experienced by patients treated with fluoropyrimidines. While erythrodysesthesia normally presents in a palmar-plantar distribution, it can also present with genital involvement, but this presentation is likely underreported and incorrectly attributed to an acute reaction from radiation therapy. This article aims to define erythrodysesthesia of the penis and scrotum as a rare but significant side effect of capecitabine. We identified five cases of moderate to severe penis and scrotal erythrodysesthesia over a 2-year period at a large tertiary cancer center, representing an estimated incidence of 3.6% among male patients with rectal cancer who were treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation within our institution. Improved understanding of erythrodysesthesia involving the penis and scrotum can facilitate early identification and treatment of symptoms, and possibly prevent the discontinuation or delay of cancer treatment in patients treated with capecitabine and similar drugs. These clinical advances would improve and prolong patient quality of life during cancer treatment and prevent complications that result in hospitalization.","[""Adames A; O'Brien DR; Kelly AR; Saltz LB; Garcia-Aguilar J; Zinovoy M; Williams V; Wu A; Reyngold M; Hajj C; Crane C; Cercek A; Smith JJ; Markova A; Cuaron J; McCann P; Romesser PB""]",2024,erythrodysesthesia is a slowly developing cutaneous reaction commonly experienced by patients treated with fluoropyrimidines. this presentation is likely underreported and incorrectly attributed to an acute reaction from radiation therapy.
"Vitamin D and viral infections: Infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancers.","Viruses can cause many human diseases. Three types of human diseases caused by viruses are discussed in this chapter: infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancers. The infectious diseases included in this chapter include three respiratory tract diseases: influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus. In addition, the mosquito-borne dengue virus diseases are discussed. Vitamin D can reduce risk, severity, and mortality of the respiratory tract diseases and possibly for dengue virus. Many autoimmune diseases are initiated by the body's reaction to a viral infection. The protective role of vitamin D in Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases such as multiple sclerosis is discussed. There are a few cancers linked to viral infections. Such cancers include cervical cancer, head and neck cancers, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and liver cancer.

Blue healing: marine biopolymers' dual role in diabetic wounds and palliative care.,"Chronic Diabetic wounds pose significant challenges in healthcare due to prolonged healing times and increased susceptibility to infections. Traditional wound dressings often fall short in providing an optimal environment for healing. Owing to their biocompatibility and biodegradability, natural polysaccharides present promising wound management alternatives. This review highlights the potential of polysaccharides derived from diverse sources, including marine organisms, in promoting wound healing. While considerable progress has been made in understanding their haemostatic, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties, further research is needed to elucidate their precise mechanisms of action and optimise their therapeutic efficacy. Harnessing the unique characteristics of marine-based polysaccharides holds excellent promise for future advancements in wound care, particularly in the detection and treatment of diabetic wound infections.",['Sudhakaran G'],2024,"polysaccharides derived from diverse sources, including marine organisms, are promising wound management alternatives. biocompatibility and biodegradability of polysaccharides are key to wound healing."
A telemonitoring intervention design for patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes: protocol for a feasibility study.,"Maintaining optimal glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is difficult. Telemedicine has the potential to support people with poorly regulated T2D in the achievement of glycemic control, especially if the telemedicine solution includes a telemonitoring component. However, the ideal telemonitoring design for people with T2D remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this feasibility study is to evaluate the feasibility of two telemonitoring designs for people with non-insulin-dependent T2D with a goal of identifying the optimal telemonitoring intervention for a planned future large-scale randomized controlled trial. This 3-month randomized feasibility study will be conducted in four municipalities in North Denmark starting in January 2024. There will be 15 participants from each municipality. Two different telemonitoring intervention designs will be tested. One intervention will include self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) combined with sleep and mental health monitoring. The second intervention will include an identical setup but with the addition of blood pressure and activity monitoring. Two municipalities will be allocated to one intervention design, whereas the other two municipalities will be allocated to the second intervention design. Qualitative interviews with participants and clinicians will be conducted to gain insight into their experiences with and acceptance of the intervention designs and trial procedures (e.g., blood sampling and questionnaires). In addition, sources of differences in direct intervention costs between the two alternative interventions will be investigated. Telemonitoring has the potential to support people with diabetes in achieving glycemic control, but the existing evidence is inconsistent, and thus, the optimal design of interventions remains unclear. The results of this feasibility study are expected to produce relevant information about telemonitoring designs for people with T2D and help guide the design of future studies. A well-tested telemonitoring design is essential to ensure the quality of telemedicine initiatives, with goals of user acceptance and improved patient outcomes. ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT06134934 .

A panel of four plasma amino acids is a promising biomarker for newly diagnosed bladder cancer.,"Metastasis and recurrence are the main causes of death in post-operative bladder cancer (BC), emphasizing the importance of exploring early-stage diagnostic markers. Serum biomarkers constitute a promising diagnostic approach for asymptomatic stage cancer as they are non-invasive, have high accuracy and low cost. To correlate concentrations of plasma amino acids with BC progression to assess their utility as an early-stage diagnostic. Newly diagnosed BC patients (n = 95) and normal controls (n = 96) were recruited during the period from 1 December 2018 to 30 December 2020. General and food frequency questionnaires established their basic information and dietary intake data. Venous blood samples were collected from fasting subjects and used to detect levels of plasma amino acids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Verification was performed on the GSE13507 transcriptome gene expression matrix of BC from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Eleven amino acids have been identified as altered in the plasma of newly diagnosed BC patients compared to controls (P < 0.05). Adjusted by gender, education, smoking and other factors, plasma ornithine level (OR = 0.256, 95% CI: 0.104-0.630) is a protective factor for BC, plasma levels of methionine (OR = 3.460, 95% CI: 1.384-8.651), arginine (OR = 3.851, 95% CI: 1.542-9.616), and glutamate (OR = 3.813, 95% CI: 1.543-9.419) are all risk factors for BC. ROC analysis demonstrated that the combination of plasma ornithine, methionine, arginine and glutamate could accurately diagnose BC (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.747-0.833). In addition, the mRNA level of arginase 1 was decreased (P < 0.05), while the inducible nitric oxide synthase was increased significantly, which may be linked with the disturbance of arginine metabolism in BC patients. Further analysis of GEO database confirmed the role of arginine metabolism. A biomarker panel containing four amino acids may provide a feasible strategy for the early diagnosis of BC.

Effect of a peer-led prevention program (P2P) on smoking in vocational high school students: Results from a two-school-year cluster-randomized trial.,"The aim of this work was to measure the impact of P2P (i.e. peer-to-peer), a peer-led smoking prevention intervention, on daily smoking prevalence of adolescents over 2 school years. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was performed over a 16-month follow-up (trial status: closed to follow-up). P2P was implemented 1-3 and 13-15 months after baseline. Assessments took place at baseline and 4, 10 and 16 months after baseline. The research team, assessors and adolescents were blinded to the study-arm assignment only at baseline. Fifteen vocational high schools in France were randomized into two clusters, using a 1:1 allocation ratio per French department (n intervention = 7, n control = 8). Participants comprised a sample of 2010 students in year 11 (i.e. 15-16 years) in vocational high schools. A total of 437 students could not be assessed at baseline (absent or left school), yielding a total sample of 1573 students (n intervention = 749, n control = 824). The P2P programme trained voluntary students to become peer educators and design smoking prevention actions for their schoolmates in the intervention group (n = 945 students), compared with a passive control group (n = 1065 students). The primary outcome was change from baseline in the prevalence of self-reported daily smoking (i.e. at least one cigarette per day) at 16 months. The 'time × group' interaction indicated that, compared with the control group, the intervention group had statistically significantly fewer daily smokers after 16 months [odds ratio (OR) = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20, 0.53]. Similarly, compared with the control group, the intervention group had statistically significantly fewer daily smokers after 4 months (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.30, 0.82) and 10 months (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.37, 0.98).

Causal association of polyunsaturated fatty acids with biliary tract diseases: A Mendelian randomization study.,"The evidence connecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to biliary problems is still highly contested and speculative despite the fact that biliary diseases are common and PUFAs have long been studied for their potential health benefits. This work used Mendelian randomization (MR) techniques in conjunction with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to clarify the causal relationships between PUFAs and biliary tract diseases. We compiled data on PUFAs, including Omega-3 fatty acids, Omega-6 fatty acids, and the ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-6:Omega-3), using GWAS. MR was used to examine biliary tract problems (cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas). Single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with PUFAs were selected as instrumental variables to estimate causal effects on biliary tract diseases. The final results were analyzed using five MR analysis techniques. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the primary outcome. And IVW was utilized in conjunction with the other MR analysis techniques (MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode). Additionally, we evaluated heterogeneity and horizontal multiplicity using the MR-Egger intercept test and Cochrane's Q test, respectively. Finally, to increase the accuracy and precision of the study outcomes, we carried out a number of sensitivity analyses. We found that Omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of cholecystitis (OR: 0.851, P = 0.009), cholelithiasis (OR: 0.787, P = 8.76e-5), and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas (OR: 0.842, P = 1.828e-4) but increased the primary biliary cholangitis (OR: 2.220, P = 0.004). There was no significant association between Omega-3 fatty acids and risk of gallbladder cancer (OR: 3.127, P = 0.530) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR: 0.919, P = 0.294). Omega-6 fatty acids were associated with a reduced risk of cholecystitis (OR: 0.845, P = 0.040). However, they were not linked to an increased or decreased risk of cholelithiasis (OR: 0.878, P = 0.14), gallbladder cancer (OR: 4.670, P = 0.515), primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR: 0.993, P = 0.962), primary cholestatic biliary cholangitis (OR: 1.404, P = 0.509), or disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. Omega-6:Omega-3 fatty acids were linked to a greater risk of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas (OR:1.168, P = 0.009, OR:1.191, P = 1.60e-6, and OR:1.160, P = 4.11e-6, respectively). But (OR: 0.315, P = 0.010) was linked to a decreased risk of primary biliary cholangitis. Not linked to risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis (OR: 1.079, P = 0.078) or gallbladder cancer (OR: 0.046, P = 0.402). According to the MR-Egger intercept, our MR examination did not appear to be impacted by any pleiotropy (all P > 0.05). Additionally, sensitivity studies validated the accuracy of the calculated causation. Inconsistent causative relationships between PUFAs and biliary tract diseases were revealed in our investigation. However, Omega-3 fatty acids were found to causally lower the risk of cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. Omega-3 fatty acids increased the risk of primary biliary cholangitis in a causative way. Omega-3 fatty acids with the risk of gallbladder cancer and primary sclerosing cholangitis did not have any statistically significant relationships. Omega-6 fatty acids were not significantly causally connected with the risk of cholelithiasis, gallbladder cancer, primary sclerosing cholangitis, or disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. However, they did play a causative role in lowering the risk of cholecystitis. Omega-6:Omega-3 fatty acids decreased the risk of primary biliary cholangitis but increased the risk of cholecystitis, gallstone disease, and disorders of gallbladder, biliary tract and pancreas. They had no effect on the risk of gallbladder cancer or primary sclerosing cholangitis. Therefore, additional research should be done to examine the probable processes mediating the link between polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk of biliary tract diseases.",['Chen X; Shi K; Zhang Y; Song Y; Wang X; Tian X'],2024,PUFAs are common and biliary diseases are common.

Based on Gadolinium Ethoxybenzyl DTPA-Enhanced MRI: Diagnostic Performance of the Category-Modified LR-5 Criteria in Patients At Risk for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"<b>Introduction:</b> We aimed to modify the LR-5 strategy to improve the diagnostic sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high-risk patients while maintaining specificity. <b>Methods:</b> This study retrospectively analyzed 412 patients with 445 liver observations who underwent preoperative gadolinium ethoxybenzyl DTPA (GD-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced MRI followed by surgical procedures or biopsies. All observations were classified according to LI-RADS v2018, and the classifications were adjusted by modifying major features (MF)(substituting threshold growth with a more HCC-specific ancillary features (AF): presence of blood products within the mass, arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE) was interpreted with hypointensity on precontrast imaging- isointensity in arterial phase (AP) and extending washout to transitional phase (TP)(2 min)). The specificity, sensitivity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were assessed to compare LR-5 (definitely HCC) diagnostic efficacy between LI-RADS version 2018 and modified LI-RADS. <b>Results:</b> Apart from nonenhancing ""capsule"", the interreader agreement of MFs and HCC-specific AFs between the two readers reached substantial or excellent ranges (κ values ranging from 0.631 to 0.911). According to LI-5 v2018, the specificity, sensitivity and PPV of HCC were 90.74%, 82.35%, and 98.17%, respectively.

Epstein-Barr virus causes vascular abnormalities in epithelial malignancies through upregulating ANXA3-HIF-1α-VEGF pathway.,"Angiogenesis is one of the characteristics of malignant tumors, and persistent generation of abnormal tumor blood vessels is an important factor contributing to tumor treatment resistance. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly prevalent DNA oncogenic virus that is associated with the development of various epithelial malignancies. However, the relationship between EBV infection and tumor vascular abnormalities as well as its underlying mechanisms is still unclear. In this study, we found that compared to EBV-uninfected tumors, EBV-infected tumors were more angiogenic, but the neovascularization was mostly immature vessels without pericyte attachment in both clinical patient tumor samples and mouse xenograft models; These immature vessels exhibited aberrant functionality, characterized by poor blood perfusion and increased vascular permeability. The vascular abnormalities caused by EBV infection exacerbated tumor hypoxia and was responsible for accelerated tumor growth. Mechanistically, EBV infection upregulated ANXA3-HIF-1α-VEGF pathway. Silencing the ANXA3 gene or neutralizing ANXA3 with an antibody can diminish vascular abnormalities, thereby increasing immune cell infiltration and alleviating treatment resistance. Finally, a new therapy combining ANXA3 blockade and NK cell + PD1 antibody significantly inhibited the growth of EBV-infected xenografts in mice. In conclusion, our study identified a previously unrecognized role for EBV infection in tumor vascular abnormalities and revealed its underlying mechanism that upregulated the ANXA3-HIF-1α-VEGF pathway. ANXA3 is a potential therapeutic target for EBV-infected tumors and ANXA3 blockade to improve vascular conditions, in combination with NK cell + PD1 antibody therapy, holds promise as an effective treatment strategy for EBV-associated epithelial malignancies.",['Chen Y; Di M; Tang Y; Zhao J; Wang Q; Guo Z; Li Y; Ouyang D; Yang J; Chen H; Wang Y; Weng D; Pan Q; Xiang T; Xia J'],2024,a new therapy combining ANXA3 blockade and NK cell + PD1 antibody significantly inhibited the growth of EBV-infected xenografts in mice. the relationship between EBV infection and tumor vascular abnormalities is still unclear.
The diagnostic value of multimodal imaging based on MR combined with ultrasound in benign and malignant breast diseases.,"We aimed to construct and validate a multimodality MRI combined with ultrasound based on radiomics for the evaluation of benign and malignant breast diseases. The preoperative enhanced MRI and ultrasound images of 131 patients with breast diseases confirmed by pathology in Aerospace Center Hospital from January 2021 to August 2023 were retrospectively analyzed, including 73 benign diseases and 58 malignant diseases. Ultrasound and 3.0 T multiparameter MRI scans were performed in all patients. Then, all the data were divided into training set and validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Regions of interest were drawn layer by layer based on ultrasound and MR enhanced sequences to extract radiomics features. The optimal radiomic features were selected by the best feature screening method. Logistic Regression classifier was used to establish models according to the best features, including ultrasound model, MRI model, ultrasound combined with MRI model. The model efficacy was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The F-test based on ANOVA was used to screen out 20 best ultrasonic features, 11 best MR Features, and 14 best features from the combined model. Among them, texture features accounted for the largest proportion, accounting for 79%.The ultrasound combined with MR Image fusion model based on logistic regression classifier had the best diagnostic performance. The AUC of the training group and the validation group were 0.92 and 091, the sensitivity was 0.80 and 0.67, the specificity was 0.90 and 0.94, and the accuracy was 0.84 and 0.79, respectively. It was better than the simple ultrasound model (AUC of validation set was 0.82) or the simple MR model (AUC of validation set was 0.85). Compared with the traditional ultrasound or magnetic resonance diagnosis of breast diseases, the multimodal model of MRI combined with ultrasound based on radiomics can more accurately predict the benign and malignant breast diseases, thus providing a better basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",['Bai D; Zhou N; Liu X; Liang Y; Lu X; Wang J; Liang L; Wang Z'],2024,131 patients with breast diseases confirmed by pathology in aerospace center hospital from January 2021 to august 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. the preoperative enhanced MRI and ultrasound images of 131 patients were retrospectively analyzed. the results were divided into training set and validation set in a 7:3 ratio.
Heparanase Stimulation of Physiological Cardiac Hypertrophy is Suppressed Following Chronic Diabetes Resulting in Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction.,"Although endothelial cells control smooth muscle tone in coronary vessels, these cells also influence subjacent cardiomyocyte growth. As heparanase, with exclusive expression in endothelial cells, enables extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and cell survival, it is conceivable that it could also encourage development of cardiac hypertrophy. Global heparanase overexpression resulted in physiological cardiac hypertrophy, likely an outcome of HSPG clustering and activation of hypertrophic signaling. The autocrine effect of heparanase to release neuregulin-1 may have also contributed to this effect. Hyperglycemia induced by streptozotocin-diabetes sensitized the heart to flow-induced release of heparanase and neuregulin-1. Despite this excess secretion, progression of diabetes caused significant gene expression changes related to mitochondrial metabolism and cell death that led to development of pathological hypertrophy and heart dysfunction. Physiological cardiac hypertrophy was also observed in rats with cardiomyocyte-specific VEGFB overexpression. When perfused, hearts from these animals released significantly higher amounts of both heparanase and neuregulin-1. However, subjecting these animals to diabetes triggered robust transcriptome changes related to metabolism, and a transition to pathological hypertrophy. Our data suggest that in the absence of mechanisms that support cardiac energy generation and prevention of cell death, as seen following diabetes, there is a transition from physiological to pathological cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in cardiac function.",['Lee CS; Shang R; Wang F; Khayambashi P; Wang H; Araujo G; Puri K; Vlodavsky I; Hussein B; Rodrigues B'],2024,"endothelial cells control smooth muscle tone in coronary vessels. heparanase overexpression enables extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming, and cell survival. hyperglycemia induced by streptozotocin-diabetes sensitized the heart to flow-induced release of heparanase and neuregulin-1."
The β-arrestin1/endothelin axis bolsters ovarian fibroblast-dependent invadosome activity and cancer cell metastatic potential.,"Recruitment of fibroblasts to tumors and their activation into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is a strategy used by tumor cells to direct extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, invasion, and metastasis, highlighting the need to investigate the molecular mechanisms driving CAF function. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) regulates the communication between cancer and stroma and facilitates the progression of serous ovarian cancer (SOC). By binding to Endothelin A (ET<sub>A</sub>) and B (ET<sub>B</sub>) receptors, ET-1 enables the recruitment of β-arrestin1 (β-arr1) and the formation of signaling complexes that coordinate tumor progression. However, how ET-1 receptors might ""educate"" human ovarian fibroblasts (HOFs) to produce altered ECM and promote metastasis remains to be elucidated. This study identifies ET-1 as a pivotal factor in the activation of CAFs capable of proteolytic ECM remodeling and the generation of heterotypic spheroids containing cancer cells with a propensity to metastasize. An autocrine/paracrine ET-1/ET<sub>A/B</sub>R/β-arr1 loop enhances HOF proliferation, upregulates CAF marker expression, secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increases collagen contractility, and cell motility. Furthermore, ET-1 facilitates ECM remodeling by promoting the lytic activity of invadosome and activation of integrin β1. In addition, ET-1 signaling supports the formation of heterotypic HOF/SOC spheroids with enhanced ability to migrate through the mesothelial monolayer, and invade, representing metastatic units. The blockade of ET<sub>A/B</sub>R or β-arr1 silencing prevents CAF activation, invadosome function, mesothelial clearance, and the invasive ability of heterotypic spheroids. In vivo, therapeutic inhibition of ET<sub>A/B</sub>R using bosentan (BOS) significantly reduces the metastatic potential of combined HOFs/SOC cells, associated with enhanced apoptotic effects on tumor cells and stromal components. These findings support a model in which ET-1/β-arr1 reinforces tumor/stroma interaction through CAF activation and fosters the survival and metastatic properties of SOC cells, which could be counteracted by ET<sub>A/B</sub>R antagonists.",['Del Rio D; Masi I; Caprara V; Ottavi F; Albertini Petroni G; Salvati E; Trisciuoglio D; Giannitelli SM; Bagnato A; Mauri E; Spadaro F; Rosanò L'],2024,"recruitment of fibroblasts to tumors is a strategy used by tumor cells to direct extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, invasion, and metastasis. a study identifies ET-1 as a pivotal factor in the activation of CAFs."
"Deferoxamine-Loaded Injectable Chitosan-Grafted Chlorogenic Acid/Oxidized Hyaluronic Acid Hybrid Hydrogel with Antibacterial, Anti-inflammatory, and Angiogenesis-Promoting Properties for Diabetic Wound Repair.","Diabetic chronic wounds are notoriously difficult to heal as a result of their susceptibility to infection. To address this issue, we constructed an innovated and adaptable solution in the form of injectable chitosan (CS) hydrogel, denoted as CCOD, with enhanced antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. This hydrogel is created through a Schiff base reaction that combines chitosan-grafted chlorogenic acid (CS-CGA) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) with deferoxamine (DFO) as a model drug. The combination of CS and CGA has demonstrated excellent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, while grafting played a pivotal role in making these positive effects stable. These unique features make it possible to customize injectable hydrogel and fit any wound shape, allowing for more effective and personalized treatment of complex bacterial infections. Furthermore, the hydrogel system is not only effective against inflammation and bacterial infections but also possesses antioxidant and angiogenic abilities, making it an ideal solution for the repair of chronic wounds that have been previously thought of as unmanageable.",['Zhong H; Fang Y; Luo M; Wang L; Huang J; Dai G; Liu K; Wu J; Du J'],2024,injectable chitosan hydrogel is a chitosan-grafted hydrogel. it is a combination of chitosan-grafted chlorogenic acid and oxidized hyaluronic acid. hydrogel is a model drug that combines chitosan-grafted chlorogenic acid.
Epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists in colorectal cancer: emerging strategies for precision therapy.,"The global prevalence of colorectal cancer highlights the need to enhance treatment strategies for improved patient outcomes. The pivotal role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in regulating cellular processes for this disease pinpoints its value as a therapeutic target, despite the emergence of resistance mechanisms over time. This review discusses the clinical evidence supporting the use of EGFR inhibitors in molecularly-selected patients based on molecular characteristics (notably <i>BRAF</i> V600E and <i>KRAS</i> G12C) including combination approaches targeting different points in in the signaling pathway, as well as strategies such as EGFR inhibitor rechallenge. The role of HER2 inhibitors and emerging approaches such as bispecific antibodies are also reviewed. Recently, inhibitors targeting the <i>KRAS</i> G12C variant have emerged, albeit with modest monotherapy activity compared to other tumor types, emphasizing the influence of histologic origins on the EGFR signaling pathway. Integration of EGFR inhibitors into precision medicine has facilitated tailored therapies addressing resistance mechanisms. Patient selection for EGFR inhibitor rechallenge guided by ctDNA findings is crucial, with ongoing investigations exploring novel combinations to enhance EGFR blockade, highlighting the transformative potential of precision medicine in shaping the future of mCRC treatment toward personalized and targeted approaches.",['González NS; Marchese PV; Baraibar I; Ros J; Salvà F; Rodríguez M; Salvà C; Vaghi C; Alcaraz A; García A; Tabernero J; Élez E'],2024,ctDNA findings highlight the need to enhance treatment strategies. a key role of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in regulating cellular processes for this disease pinpoints its value as a therapeutic target.
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio associated with renal function in type 2 diabetic patients.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, an accurate and convenient marker for early detection and appropriate management of CKD in individuals with T2DM is limited. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CKD. Nonetheless, the predictive value of NLR for renal damage in type 2 diabetic patients remains understudied. To investigate the relationship between NLR and renal function in T2DM patients. This study included 1040 adults aged 65 or older with T2DM from Shanghai's Community Health Service Center. The total number of neutrophils and lymphocytes was detected, and NLR levels were calculated. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Participants were divided into four groups based on NLR levels. The clinical data and biochemical characteristics were compared among groups. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the association between NLR levels and CKD. Significant differences were found in terms of sex, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol among patients with T2DM in different NLR groups (<i>P</i> < 0.0007). T2DM patients in the highest NLR quartile had a higher prevalence of CKD (<i>P</i> for trend = 0.0011). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a high NLR was an independent risk factor for CKD in T2DM patients even after adjustment for important clinical and pathological parameters (<i>P</i> = 0.0001, odds ratio = 1.41, 95% confidence intervals: 1.18-1.68). An elevated NLR in patients with T2DM is associated with higher prevalence of CKD, suggesting that it could be a marker for the detection and evaluation of diabetic kidney disease.",['Gao JL; Shen J; Yang LP; Liu L; Zhao K; Pan XR; Li L; Xu JJ'],2024,"type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a leading risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) however, an accurate and convenient marker for early detection and appropriate management of CKD in individuals with T2DM is limited."
ADA2 regulates inflammation and hematopoietic stem cell emergence via the A<sub>2b</sub>R pathway in zebrafish.,"Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is an inborn error of immunity caused by loss-of-function mutations in the adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) gene. Clinical manifestations of DADA2 include vasculopathy and immuno-hematological abnormalities, culminating in bone marrow failure. A major gap exists in our knowledge of the regulatory functions of ADA2 during inflammation and hematopoiesis, mainly due to the absence of an ADA2 orthologue in rodents. Exploring these mechanisms is essential for understanding disease pathology and developing new treatments. Zebrafish possess two ADA2 orthologues, cecr1a and cecr1b, with the latter showing functional conservation with human ADA2. We establish a cecr1b-loss-of-function zebrafish model that recapitulates the immuno-hematological and vascular manifestations observed in humans. Loss of Cecr1b disrupts hematopoietic stem cell specification, resulting in defective hematopoiesis. This defect is caused by induced inflammation in the vascular endothelium. Blocking inflammation, pharmacological modulation of the A<sub>2</sub>r pathway, or the administration of the recombinant human ADA2 corrects these defects, providing insights into the mechanistic link between ADA2 deficiency, inflammation and immuno-hematological abnormalities. Our findings open up potential therapeutic avenues for DADA2 patients.",['Brix A; Belleri L; Pezzotta A; Pettinato E; Mazzola M; Zoccolillo M; Marozzi A; Monteiro R; Del Bene F; Mortellaro A; Pistocchi A'],2024,adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) gene is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is a gene that is
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve the Accuracy of a Wrist-Worn, Noninvasive Glucose Monitor: A Pilot Study.","Self-monitoring of glucose is important to the successful management of diabetes; however, existing monitoring methods require a degree of invasive measurement which can be unpleasant for users. This study investigates the accuracy of a noninvasive glucose monitoring system that analyses spectral variations in microwave signals. An open-label, pilot design study was conducted with four cohorts (N = 5/cohort). In each session, a dial-resonating sensor (DRS) attached to the wrist automatically collected data every 60 seconds, with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model converting signal resonance output to a glucose prediction. Plasma glucose was measured in venous blood samples every 5 minutes for Cohorts 1 to 3 and every 10 minutes for Cohort 4. Accuracy was evaluated by calculating the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between the DRS and plasma glucose values. Accurate plasma glucose predictions were obtained across all four cohorts using a random sampling procedure applied to the full four-cohort data set, with an average MARD of 10.3%. A statistical analysis demonstrates the quality of these predictions, with a surveillance error grid (SEG) plot indicating no data pairs falling into the high-risk zones. These findings show that MARD values approaching accuracies comparable to current commercial alternatives can be obtained from a multiparticipant pilot study with the application of AI. Microwave biosensors and AI models show promise for improving the accuracy and convenience of glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes.",['Qureshi MRA; Bain SC; Luzio S; Handy C; Fowles DJ; Love B; Wareham K; Barlow L; Dunseath GJ; Crane J; Masso IC; Ryan JAM; Chaudhry MS'],2024,"a pilot design study was conducted with four cohorts (N = 5/cohort). in each session, a dial-resonating sensor (DRS) attached to the wrist automatically collected data every 60 seconds. a novel artificial intelligence model converting signal resonance output to a glucose prediction."
Deciphering the clinical spectrum of gastric disease in patients with Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome.,"Juvenile Polyposis Syndrome (JPS) is a rare hereditary autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants (PV) located in SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. Precise clinical and endoscopic presentation as the evolution of gastric lesions remain ill-known. Clinical, endoscopic, genetic, pathological data from patients with SMAD4 or BMPR1A PVs included between 2007 and 2020 in the French network on rare digestive polyposis (RENAPOL) database were prospectively collected to address uncertainties regarding gastric involvement. Thirty-six patients were included: 25 (69.5%) had SMAD4 PVs, 11 had BMPR1A PVs. For SMAD4 PV carriers, median age at inclusion was 43.0 years [range 10-78]. At baseline esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), 22/25 (88%) exhibited at least one gastric juvenile polyp, 5/25 (20%) had macroscopic signs of inflammatory gastritis. Early gastric disease was mostly located under the cardia, then progressed to gastric antrum and body. During a mean follow-up period of 55.0 months, 12/25 had gastric disease progression (i.e. new juvenile polyps (91.6%), diffuse gastric involvement (41.6%), inflammatory flat progression (25%)). Among 62 biopsies, low-grade dysplasia was observed in 5 (7.5%) samples from 2 patients. Nine carriers (36%) underwent gastrectomy (mean age of 47.2 years) due to diffuse gastric involvement or worsening clinical symptoms. Gastric adenocarcinoma (T1) was found in one gastrectomy specimen. Among the 11 patients with BMPR1A PVs, 2 had gastric hamartomatomas at baseline EGD, none with dysplasia or symptoms. Gastric involvement in JPS appears to be progressive during life, initiating in the cardia area, and mostly concerns SMAD4 PV carriers.",['Muller M; Baldysiak E; Benech N; Pioche M; Hervieu V; Calavas L; Tusseau M; Dupuis-Girod S; Saurin JC'],2024,a rare hereditary autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndrome is caused by germline pathogenic variants (PV) located in SMAD4 or BMPR1A genes. a symbiosis of a symbiosis is a rare hereditary autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndrome.
Primary Care Provider Visits Among Cancer Survivors 5-7 Years Postdiagnosis.,"Cancer survivors experience better outcomes when primary care providers (PCPs) are engaged in their care. Nearly all survivors have a PCP engaged in their care in the initial 5 years postdiagnosis, but little is known about sustained PCP engagement. We assessed PCP engagement in survivors' care 5-7 years postdiagnosis and characterized survivors most vulnerable to loss to PCP follow-up. We linked electronic health record ambulatory care and cancer registry data from an National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center to identify eligible survivors (≥18 years; diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or uterine cancer; had an in-network PCP). We used multiple logistic regression to assess associations between survivor demographics, clinical factors, and health care utilization and odds of sustained PCP engagement. In 5-7 years postdiagnosis, PCPs were engaged in care for 43% of survivors. Survivors with sustained PCP-engagement were on average 4.6 years older than those without (<i>P</i> < .0001); survivors had 1.36 greater odds of having regular PCP visits for each decade increase in age on cancer diagnosis (<i>P</i> = .0030). Survivors were less likely to be lost to PCP follow-up if diagnosed at an earlier stage with odds at 0.57 and 0.10 for stage I and stage IV, respectively (<i>P</i> = .0005), and had 2.70 greater odds of engagement in care with at least one oncology visit annually 5-7 years postdiagnosis (<i>P</i> < .0001). Sustained PCP engagement is endorsed as critical by survivors, PCPs, and oncologists. We found most survivors were lost to PCP follow-up 5-7 years postdiagnosis. Our study is among the first to contribute empirical evidence of survivors being lost in transition. Findings from this study demonstrate the need to bridge gaps in long-term care for cancer survivors.",['Birken SA; Peluso AG; Shalowitz DI; Isom S; Wagi CR; Randazzo A; Falk D; Strom C; Bell R; Weaver KE'],2024,a PCP engaged in survivors' care 5-7 years postdiagnosis. a study characterized survivors most vulnerable to loss to PCP follow-up. a study found that a PCP engaged in survivors' care was not sustained.
Synaptotagmins family affect glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells through their ubiquitination-mediated degradation and glucose transporter-1 regulation.,"Synaptotagmins (SYTs) are a family of 17 membrane transporters that function as calcium ion sensors during the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitters and hormones. However, few studies have reported whether members of the SYT family play a role in glucose uptake in diabetic retinopathy (DR) through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and the possible regulatory mechanism of SYTs. To elucidate the role of the SYT family in the regulation of glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells and explore its potential as a therapeutic target for the clinical management of DR. DR was induced by streptozotocin in C57BL/6J mice and by high glucose medium in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19). Bioinformatics analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, flow cytometry, ELISA, HE staining, and TUNEL staining were used for analysis. Six differentially expressed proteins (SYT2, SYT3, SYT4, SYT7, SYT11, and SYT13) were found between the DR and control groups, and SYT4 was highly expressed. Hyperglycemia induces SYT4 overexpression, manipulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to induce GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, promotes abnormal expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and excessive glucose uptake, induces ARPE-19 cell apoptosis, and promotes DR progression. Parkin deficiency inhibits the proteasomal degradation of SYT4 in DR, resulting in SYT4 accumulation and enhanced GLUT1 fusion with the plasma membrane, and these effects were blocked by oe-Parkin treatment. Moreover, dysregulation of the myelin transcription factor 1 (Myt1)-induced transcription of SYT4 in DR further activated the SYT4-mediated stimulus-secretion coupling process, and this process was inhibited in the oe-MYT1-treated group. Our study reveals the key role of SYT4 in regulating glucose transport in retinal pigment epithelial cells during the pathogenesis of DR and the underlying mechanism and suggests potential therapeutic targets for clinical DR.",['Xu H; Zhang LB; Luo YY; Wang L; Zhang YP; Chen PQ; Ba XY; Han J; Luo H'],2024,synaptotagmins (SYTs) are a family of 17 membrane transporters that function as calcium ion sensors during the release of Casup>2+/sup>-dependent neurotransmitters and hormones. but few studies have reported whether members of the SYT family play a role in glucose uptake in diabetic retinopathy (DR) through Casup>2+/sup>/glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and
[Prevention of radiotherapy-related cardiotoxicity : benefits of a specialized cardio-oncologic assessment and follow-up].,"To accept the toxic side effects of any treatment, whether medical, surgical or radiotherapeutic, cannot be avoided but implies to evaluate them taking into account the severity and prognosis of the disease that is concerned. Screening, preventing and treatment of these side effects are an integral aspect of the treatment of cancers. We will here review the contribution of the cardio-oncology, a recently emerged medical specialty. Cardiac irradiation cannot be avoided when treating several cancers, most frequently left sided breast cancer. As soon as radiotherapy is considered, it is of prime importance to evaluate each patient's risk factors and to handle them. If technical progresses have led to the complete disappearance of acute side effects of radiotherapy, this is not true for the delayed ones that may occur many years after the irradiation. Hence the need for «red flags» and for a systematic follow-up. Cardiac complications of left breast irradiation concern all aspects of cardiology: diseases of cardiac rhythm, valvulopathies, heart failure, coronary and pericardial disorders.",['Moonen M'],2024,"irradiation can be avoided when treating several cancers, most frequently left sided breast cancer. it is of prime importance to evaluate each patient's risk factors and to handle them."
Targeting autophagy in diabetic cardiomyopathy: From molecular mechanisms to pharmacotherapy.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiac microvascular complication caused by metabolic disorders. It is characterized by myocardial remodeling and dysfunction. The pathogenesis of DCM is associated with abnormal cellular metabolism and organelle accumulation. Autophagy is thought to play a key role in the diabetic heart, and a growing body of research suggests that modulating autophagy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for DCM. Here, we have summarized the major signaling pathways involved in the regulation of autophagy in DCM, including Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), Forkhead box subfamily O proteins (FOXOs), Sirtuins (SIRTs), and PTEN-inducible kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin. Given the significant role of autophagy in DCM, we further identified natural products and chemical drugs as regulators of autophagy in the treatment of DCM.

"Health Risk Assessment of Potentially Toxic Elements Contamination of Commonly Consumed Fruits in Bahir Dar Town, Northwest Ethiopia.","Excess accumulation of potentially toxic elements in frequently consumed fruits is a serious threat to human health. The aim of this study was to determine the levels of cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) and to estimate the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks associated with their daily intake in commonly consumed fruits in Bahir Dar town, northwest Ethiopia. Three types of fruits (mango, banana, and orange) were collected using a simple random sampling method from open markets in Bahir Dar town. Wet digestion was used, and the concentration of potentially toxic elements was analyzed in the edible portion of the fruits. The average daily intake (ADI), hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and target cancer risk (TCR) were estimated to assess the human health risks posed by the intake of those potentially toxic elements from the consumption of the studied fruits. The concentrations of Cr and Cu were lower than the maximum limit of normal values in mango, banana, and orange. However, the Pb and Cd concentrations (mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in mango were 0.576 and 1.771, respectively, which exceeded the FAO/WHO recommended permissible limits of 0.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 0.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The ADI of potentially toxic elements was found to be lower than the maximum permitted tolerable daily intake in the studied fruits, and the HI values (mgday<sup>-1</sup> kg<sup>-1</sup>) of all studied potentially toxic elements were lower than one in banana and orange, except mango (3.69). The TCR values for Pb, Cd, and Cr in banana and orange were 7.16 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 7.15 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, respectively, which exceeded the recommended threshold risk limit (>1 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), but in mango (1.71 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), the level was above the moderate risk limit (>1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). However, the TCR value in all the studied fruits was above the recommended safe limit (ILCR < 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA).

Transcriptional changes during crown-root development and emergence in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).,"Roots play an important role during plant growth and development, ensuring water and nutrient uptake. Understanding the mechanisms regulating their initiation and development opens doors towards root system architecture engineering. Here, we investigated by RNA-seq analysis the changes in gene expression in the barley stem base of 1 day-after-germination (DAG) and 10DAG seedlings when crown roots are formed. We identified 2,333 genes whose expression was lower in the stem base of 10DAG seedlings compared to 1DAG seedlings. Those genes were mostly related to basal cellular activity such as cell cycle organization, protein biosynthesis, chromatin organization, cytoskeleton organization or nucleotide metabolism. In opposite, 2,932 genes showed up-regulation in the stem base of 10DAG seedlings compared to 1DAG seedlings, and their function was related to phytohormone action, solute transport, redox homeostasis, protein modification, secondary metabolism. Our results highlighted genes that are likely involved in the different steps of crown root formation from initiation to primordia differentiation and emergence, and revealed the activation of different hormonal pathways during this process. This whole transcriptomic study is the first study aiming at understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling crown root development in barley.

Everolimus alleviates CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell inflammation by regulating autophagy and cellular redox homeostasis.,"Aging is associated with the onset and progression of multiple diseases, which limit health span. Chronic low-grade inflammation in the absence of overt infection is considered the simmering source that triggers age-associated diseases. Failure of many cellular processes during aging is mechanistically linked to inflammation; however, the overall decline in the cellular homeostasis mechanism of autophagy has emerged as one of the top and significant inducers of inflammation during aging, frequently known as inflammaging. Thus, physiological or pharmacological interventions aimed at improving autophagy are considered geroprotective. Rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are known for their ability to inhibit mTOR and thus regulate autophagy. This study assessed the efficacy of everolimus, a rapalog, in regulating inflammatory cytokine production in T cells from older adults. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from older adults were treated with a physiological dose of everolimus (0.01 µM), and indices of autophagy and inflammation were assessed to gain a mechanistic understanding of the effect of everolimus on inflammation. Everolimus (Ever) upregulated autophagy and broadly alleviated inflammatory cytokines produced by multiple T cell subsets. Everolimus's ability to alleviate the cytokines produced by Th17 subsets of T cells, such as IL-17A and IL-17F, was dependent on autophagy and antioxidant signaling pathways. Repurposing the antineoplastic drug everolimus for curbing inflammaging is promising, given the drug's ability to restore multiple cellular homeostasis mechanisms.",['Rockhold JD; Marszalkowski H; Sannella M; Gibney K; Murphy L; Zukowski E; Kalantar GH; SantaCruz-Calvo S; Hart SN; Kuhn MK; Yu J; Stefanik O; Chase G; Proctor EA; Hasturk H; Nikolajczyk BS; Bharath LP'],2024,"chronic low-grade inflammation in the absence of overt infection is considered the simmering source that triggers age-associated diseases. failure of many cellular processes during aging is mechanistically linked to inflammation. however, the overall decline in the cellular homeostasis mechanism of autophagy has emerged as one of the top and significant inducers of inflammation during aging."

In addition, there are currently no data on a possible increased risk of AP in liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes treated with GLP1RAs. In a population of liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes receiving GLP1RA-based therapy, we reported an incidence of AP of 3.0% (two subjects). No cases were reported in liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, insulin or metformin, neither in kidney or lung-transplanted patients treated with GLP1RAs. In both patients with AP, the only additional risk factor for its development was a history of re-transplantation (liver or combined kidney/liver). For this reason, we suggest particular caution when considering GLP1RAs-based therapies in liver transplanted patients with multiple risk factors for AP, such as a history of repeated and complex abdominal surgery.",['Grancini V; Cogliati I; Gaglio A; Resi V; Orsi E'],2024,a population of liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes receiving therapy reported AP of 3.0%. there are currently no data on a possible increased risk of AP in liver-transplanted individuals with diabetes treated with GLP1RAs.
Origins of cancer: ain't it just mature cells misbehaving?,"A pervasive view is that undifferentiated stem cells are alone responsible for generating all other cells and are the origins of cancer. However, emerging evidence demonstrates fully differentiated cells are plastic, can be coaxed to proliferate, and also play essential roles in tissue maintenance, regeneration, and tumorigenesis. Here, we review the mechanisms governing how differentiated cells become cancer cells. First, we examine the unique characteristics of differentiated cell division, focusing on why differentiated cells are more susceptible than stem cells to accumulating mutations. Next, we investigate why the evolution of multicellularity in animals likely required plastic differentiated cells that maintain the capacity to return to the cell cycle and required the tumor suppressor p53. Finally, we examine an example of an evolutionarily conserved program for the plasticity of differentiated cells, paligenosis, which helps explain the origins of cancers that arise in adults. Altogether, we highlight new perspectives for understanding the development of cancer and new strategies for preventing carcinogenic cellular transformations from occurring.",['Cho CJ; Brown JW; Mills JC'],2024,"a pervasive view is that undifferentiated stem cells are alone responsible for generating all other cells and are the origins of cancer. however, emerging evidence demonstrates fully differentiated cells are plastic, can be coaxed to proliferate, and also play essential roles in tissue maintenance, regeneration, and tumorigenesis."
Glucose Regulation of β-Cell KATP Channels: Is a New Model Needed?,"The canonical model of glucose-induced increase in insulin secretion involves the metabolism of glucose via glycolysis and the citrate cycle, resulting in increased ATP synthesis by the respiratory chain and the closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The resulting plasma membrane depolarization, followed by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, then induces insulin granule fusion. Merrins and colleagues have recently proposed an alternative model whereby KATP channels are controlled by pyruvate kinase, using glycolytic and mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to generate microdomains of high ATP/ADP immediately adjacent to KATP channels. This model presents several challenges. First, how mitochondrially generated PEP, but not ATP produced abundantly by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase, can gain access to the proposed microdomains is unclear. Second, ATP/ADP fluctuations imaged immediately beneath the plasma membrane closely resemble those in the bulk cytosol. Third, ADP privation of the respiratory chain at high glucose, suggested to drive alternating, phased-locked generation by mitochondria of ATP or PEP, has yet to be directly demonstrated. Finally, the approaches used to explore these questions may be complicated by off-target effects. We suggest instead that Ca2+ changes, well known to affect both ATP generation and consumption, likely drive cytosolic ATP/ADP oscillations that in turn regulate KATP channels and membrane potential. Thus, it remains to be demonstrated that a new model is required to replace the existing, mitochondrial bioenergetics-based model.",['Rutter GA; Sweet IR'],2024,"canonical model of glucose-induced increase in insulin secretion involves metabolism of glucose via glycolysis and the citrate cycle. resulting plasma membrane depolarization followed by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels then induces insulin granule fusion. adrian saunder: how mitochondrial generated PEP, but not ATP produced abundantly by the mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase, can gain access to the proposed microdomains is unclear."
Apolipoprotein ɛ4 is associated with increased risk of fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation: the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing Women.,"Apolipoprotein ɛ4 (APOE ɛ4) may be a genetic risk factor for reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle function, which could have implications for fall and fracture risk. We examined the association between APOE ɛ4 status and long-term fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation risk in older women. 1276 community-dwelling women from the Perth Longitudinal Study of Ageing Women (mean age ± SD = 75.2 ± 2.7 years) were included. At baseline, women underwent APOE genotyping and detailed phenotyping for covariates including prevalent falls and fractures, as well as health and lifestyle factors. The association between APOE ɛ4 with fall-, any fracture-, and hip fracture-related hospitalisations, obtained over 14.5 years from linked health records, were examined using multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models. Over 14.5 years, 507 (39.7%) women experienced a fall-related hospitalisation, 360 (28.2%) women experienced a fracture-related hospitalisation, including 143 (11.2%) attributed to a hip fracture. In multivariable-adjusted models, compared to non-carriers, APOE ɛ4 carriers (n=297, 23.3%) had greater risk for a fall- (HR 1.48 95%CI 1.22-1.81), fracture- (HR 1.28, 95%CI 1.01-1.63) or hip fracture-related hospitalisation (HR 1.83 95%CI 1.29-2.61). The estimates remained similar when specific fall and fracture risk factors (fear of falling, plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, grip strength, timed-up-and-go, hip BMD, vitamin K status, prevalent diabetes, HbA1c, cholesterol, abbreviated mental test score) were added to the multivariable model. In conclusion, APOE ɛ4 is a potential risk factor for fall- and fracture-related hospitalisation in community-dwelling older women. Screening for APOE ɛ4 could provide clinicians an opportunity to direct higher risk individuals to appropriate intervention strategies.",['Pratt J; Dalla Via J; Sale C; Gebre AK; Stephan BCM; Laws S; Zhu K; Lim WH; Prince RL; Lewis JR; Sim M'],2024,APOE 4 may be a genetic risk factor for reduced bone mineral density. apolipoprotein 4 may be a genetic risk factor for reduced bone mineral density. apolipoprotein 4 may be a genetic risk factor for reduced bone mineral density.
Risk of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other interstitial lung diseases following organic dust exposure.,"Organic dust is associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and associations with other types of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been suggested. We examined the association between occupational organic dust exposure and hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other ILDs in a cohort study. The study population included all residents of Denmark born in 1956 or later with at least 1 year of gainful employment since 1976. Incident cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other ILDs were identified in the Danish National Patient Register 1994-2015. Job exposure matrices were used to assign individual annual levels of exposure to organic dust, endotoxin and wood dust from 1976 to 2015. We analysed exposure-response relations by different exposure metrics using a discrete-time hazard model. For organic dust, we observed increasing risk with increasing cumulative exposure with incidence rate ratios (IRR) per 10 unit-years of 1.19 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.27) for hypersensitivity pneumonitis and 1.04 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.06) for other ILDs. We found increasing risk with increasing cumulative endotoxin exposure for hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other ILDs with IRRs per 5000 endotoxin units/m<sup>3</sup>-years of 1.55 (95% CI 1.38 to 1.73) and 1.09 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.19), respectively. For both exposures, risk also increased with increasing duration of exposure and recent exposure. No increased risks were observed for wood dust exposure. Exposure-response relations were observed between organic dust and endotoxin exposure and hypersensitivity pneumonitis and other ILDs, with lower risk estimates for the latter. The findings indicate that organic dust should be considered a possible cause of any ILD. j.no.: 1-16-02-196-17.",['Iversen IB; Vestergaard JM; Basinas I; Ohlander J; Peters S; Bendstrup E; Bonde JPE; Schlünssen V; Rasmussen F; Stokholm ZA; Andersen MB; Kromhout H; Kolstad HA'],2024,organic dust is associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. association with other types of interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been suggested.
Surgically-Induced Necrotizing Scleritis After Pars Plana Vitrectomy: A Case Report.,"Surgically induced necrotizing scleritis (SINS) is a rare delayed hypersensitivity reaction following ocular surgeries, characterized by pain and redness at the surgical site. While commonly reported in various ocular surgeries, its occurrence after vitreoretinal procedures remains infrequent. We present a case of a 61-year-old diabetic male who developed progressive scleral melting and uveal exposure two months after an uneventful 23-gauge vitrectomy for retinal detachment. The infectious and immunologic profile was negative. Despite aggressive medical and surgical interventions, the patient exhibited advancing scleral melting. The diagnostic challenge lies in determining the relative contributions of trauma, epithelial breakdown, immune activation, and infection in these patients. Our patient's uncontrolled diabetes potentially aggravated vascular disruption, contributing to delayed wound healing and immune complex deposition. The treatment involved topical steroids with broad-spectrum antibiotics, followed by conjunctival flap and oral corticosteroids. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, cautious immunosuppression, and thorough infection evaluation in managing postoperative scleritis. The limitations include a single culture test and the patient being lost to follow-up.",['Tanveer S; Priyatha V; Tahir A; Ramesh D; Mahmoud M; Tanveer S'],2024,"a 61-year-old diabetic male developed progressive scleral melting and uveal exposure two months after an uneventful 23-gauge vitrectomy for retinal detachment. the patient's uncontrolled diabetes potentially aggravated vascular disruption, contributing to delayed wound healing and immune complex deposition."
Hyaluronic Acid-Coated Silica Nanoparticles for Targeted Delivery of Nitric Oxide to Cancer Cells.,"Drug resistance and off-target toxicity are two of the greatest challenges to chemotherapeutic melanoma treatments. Nitric oxide (NO) represents an attractive alternative to conventional therapeutics due to its numerous anticancer properties and low probability of engendering resistance. As NO is highly reactive, macromolecular NO donors are needed for the controlled and targeted delivery of NO for therapeutic applications. Herein, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) coated with hyaluronic acid (HA) were developed as a NO delivery system to facilitate controlled delivery to cancer cells through both passive and active targeting via the enhanced permeation and retention effect and directed binding of HA with CD44 receptors, respectively. The aminosilane modification, HA concentration, and HA molecular weight were systematically evaluated to facilitate the MSN coating and NO loading. The hydrodynamic diameter and dispersity of the nanoparticles increased after HA coating due to the hydrophilic nature of HA, with greater increases observed at higher HA molecular weight. Lower starting concentrations of HA and aminosilanes with longer alkyl chains favored more efficient HA coating. Faster NO-release kinetics and lower NO payloads were observed for the HA-coated MSNs relative to uncoated MSNs. However, the localized delivery of NO to cancer cells through the active targeting conferred by HA increased levels of oxidative stress and induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in melanoma cells. Cytotoxicity was also evaluated against human dermal fibroblasts, with the use of 6 kDa HA-coated MSNs resulting in the greatest therapeutic indices. Enhanced internalization of HA-coated nanoparticles into melanoma cells versus uncoated nanoparticles was visualized with confocal microscopy and quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. In total, HA-coated MSNs represent a promising NO delivery system for potential use as a chemotherapeutic for skin melanomas.",['Grayton QE; Phan TT; Kussatz CC; Schoenfisch MH'],2024,melanoma cells are undergoing a controlled and targeted delivery of NO. melanoma cells are undergoing a high dose of nitrate. melanoma cells are undergoing a high dose of nitrate.
Smart Contact Lens for Colorimetric Visualization of Glucose Levels in the Body Fluid.,"Frequent blood glucose monitoring is a crucial routine for diabetic patients. Traditional invasive methods can cause discomfort and pain and even pose a risk of infection. As a result, researchers have been exploring noninvasive techniques. However, a limited number of products have been developed for the market due to their high cost. In this study, we developed a low-cost, highly accessible, and noninvasive contact lens-based glucose monitoring system. We functionalized the surface of the contact lens with boronic acid, which has a strong but reversible binding affinity to glucose. To achieve facile conjugation of boronic acid, we utilized a functional coating layer called poly(tannic acid). The functionalized contact lens binds to glucose in body fluids (e.g., tear) and releases it when soaked in an enzymatic cocktail, allowing for the glucose level to be quantified through a colorimetric assay. Importantly, the transparency and oxygen permeability of the contact lens, which are crucial for practical use, were maintained after functionalization, and the lenses showed high biocompatibility. Based on the analysis of colorimetric data generated by the smartphone application and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra, we believe that this contact lens has a high potential to be used as a smart diagnostic tool for monitoring and managing blood glucose levels.",['Seo J; Kang J; Kim J; Han H; Park M; Shin M; Lee K'],2024,researchers have been exploring noninvasive methods. but a limited number of products have been developed for the market. the contact lens functionalized the surface of the contact lens with boronic acid.
Metformin use in pregnancy: What about long-term effects in offspring?,"Metformin use in pregnancy is increasing worldwide. Unlike insulin, metformin crosses the placenta. Consequently, maternal and fetal concentrations are comparable. Teratogenic effects are not reported, nor are adverse pregnancy outcomes. Reduced risk of hypertensive disorders, hypoglycemia, and macrosomia are potential benefits, together with lower gestational weight gain. Although metformin has been prescribed for pregnant women during the last 40 years, long-term data regarding offspring outcomes are still lacking. Independent of maternal glycemic control, recent meta-analyses report lower birthweight but accelerated postnatal growth and higher body mass index in metformin-exposed children. The longest follow-up study of placebo-controlled metformin exposure in utero found an increased prevalence of central adiposity and obesity among children 5-10 years old. Recently, a Danish study reported a threefold increased risk of genital anomalies in boys, whose fathers used metformin around the time of conception. This commentary addresses the current controversies on metformin use in pregnancy.",['Toft JH; Økland I'],2024,"metformin use in pregnancy is increasing worldwide. compared to insulin, metformin crosses placenta. teratogenic effects are not reported, nor adverse pregnancy outcomes."
Proportionate mortality following dysvascular partial foot amputation and how this compares to transtibial amputation: a systematic review.,"A large proportion of people die in the years following dysvascular partial foot amputation (PFA) or transtibial amputation (TTA) given the long-term consequences of peripheral vascular disease and/or diabetes. A critical appraisal of recent research is needed to understand the underlying cause of variation and synthesise data for use in consultations about amputation surgery and patient-facing resources. This systematic review aimed to describe proportionate mortality following dysvascular PFA and to compare this between PFA and TTA. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023399161). Peer-reviewed studies of original research were included if they: were published in English between 1 January 2016, and 12 April 2024, included discrete cohorts with PFA, or PFA and TTA, and measured proportionate mortality following dysvascular amputation. Seventeen studies were included in the review. Following dysvascular PFA, proportionate mortality increased from 30 days (2.1%) to 1-year (13.9%), 3-years (30.1%), and 5-years (42.2%). One study compared proportionate mortality 1-year after dysvascular PFA and TTA, showing a higher relative risk of dying after TTA (RR 1.51). Proportionate mortality has not changed in recent years. These results are comparable to a previous systematic review that included studies published before 31 December 2015.Implications for rehabilitationIt is important to ensure data describing mortality in the years following dysvascular partial foot or transtibial amputation is up to date and accurate.Evidence about proportionate mortality has not changed in recent years and the results are comparable to previous systematic reviews.Data describing mortality outcomes can be used in decision aids that support conversations about the choice of amputation level.",['Ward Z; Ridgewell E; Quigley M; Fatone S; Dillon MP'],2024,systematic review aimed to describe proportionate mortality following dysvascular PFA. compared proportionate mortality 1-year after dysvascular PFA and TTA.
TIGIT Regulates T Cell Inflammation in Airway Inflammatory Diseases.,"TIGIT, a co-inhibitory receptor found on T cells and NK cells, transmits inhibitory signals upon binding to its ligand. This interaction suppresses the activation of various signaling pathways, leading to functional exhaustion of cells, ultimately dampening excessive inflammatory responses or facilitating immune evasion in tumors. Dysregulated TIGIT expression has been noted in T cells across different inflammatory conditions, exhibiting varying effects based on T cell subsets. TIGIT predominantly restrains the effector function of pro-inflammatory T cells, upholds the suppressive function of regulatory T cells, and influences Tfh maturation. Mechanistically, the IL27-induced transcription factors c-Maf and Blimp-1 are believed to be key regulators of TIGIT expression in T cells. Notably, TIGIT expression in T cells is implicated in lung diseases, particularly airway inflammatory conditions such as lung cancer, obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, sarcoidosis, and COVID-19. This review emphasizes the significance of TIGIT in the context of T cell immunity and airway inflammatory diseases.",['Ke J; Huang S; He Z; Lei S; Lin S; Duan M'],2024,TIGIT is a co-inhibitory receptor found on T cells and NK cells. it transmits inhibitory signals upon binding to its ligand. this interaction suppresses the activation of various signaling pathways.
The therapeutic effect and targets of <i>herba Sarcandrae</i> on breast cancer and the construction of a prognostic signature consisting of inflammation-related genes.,"The prevalence of breast cancer (BRCA), which is common among women, is on the rise. This study applied network pharmacology to explore the potential mechanism of action of <i>herba sarcandrae</i> in BRCA and construct a prognostic signature composed of inflammation-related genes. The active ingredients of <i>herba sarcandrae</i> were screened using the SymMap, TCMID, and TCMSP platforms, and the molecular targets were determined in the UniProt database. The ""drug-active compound-potential target"" network was established with Cytoscape 3.7.2. The molecular targets were subjected to disease ontology, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG) analyses. AutoDock software was used for molecular docking. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to inflammation were obtained from the BRCA Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In the training cohort, the univariate Cox regression model was applied to preliminarily screen prognostic genes. A multigene signature was built by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, followed by validation through Kaplan‒Meier, Cox, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Forty-one active compounds were identified, and 265 therapeutic targets for <i>herba sarcandrae</i> were predicted. GO enrichment results revealed significant enrichment of biological processes, such as response to xenobiotic stimuli, response to nutrient levels, and response to lipopolysaccharide. KEGG analysis revealed significant enrichment of pathways such as AGE-RAGE and chemical carcinogenesis receptor activation signaling pathways. In addition, <i>the herbs Marc-Andre</i> and rutin were shown to mediate BRCA cell proliferation and apoptosis via the interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway. Sixteen inflammatory signatures, including BST2, GPR132, IL12B, IL18, IL1R1, IL2RB, IRF1, and others, were constructed, and the risk score was found to be a strong independent prognostic factor for overall survival in BRCA patients. The 16-inflammation signature was associated with several clinical features (age, clinical stage, T, and N classifications) and could reflect immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironments with different immune cells. <i>Herba sarcandrae</i> and <i>rutin</i> were shown to mediate BRCA cell proliferation and apoptosis via the IRF1/STAT3/PD-L1 pathway, and the 16-member inflammatory signature might be a novel biomarker for predicting BRCA patient prognosis, providing more accurate guidance for clinical treatment prognosis evaluation and having important reference value for individualized treatment selection.",['Yuan J; Lin M; Yang S; Yin H; Ouyang S; Xie H; Tang H; Ou X; Zeng Z'],2024,prevalence of breast cancer is on the rise. the prevalence of breast cancer is common among women. the study applied network pharmacology to explore the potential mechanism of action of i>herba sarcandrae/i> in BRCA.
Accuracy of Salivary Circulating Tumor Human Papillomavirus DNA in Detecting Oropharyngeal Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Circulating tumor human papillomavirus DNA (ctHPV DNA) has shown potential as a biomarker capable of improving outcomes in patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal (OP) cancer. It can be isolated from plasma or saliva, with the latter offering reduced invasiveness and theoretic reduction of lead time. To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the accuracy of salivary ctHPV DNA for detecting HPV-associated OP cancer. Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception through October 2023. All patients who underwent salivary ctHPV DNA testing at presentation for possible or diagnosed HPV-related OP cancer were included. Non-English and review publications were excluded. Two authors independently voted on article inclusion with a third resolving conflicting votes. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines, multiple authors independently abstracted data and assessed bias of included articles. Bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was performed with I2 to assess for study heterogeneity. Sensitivities, specificities, positive likelihood ratios (PLR), negative likelihood ratios (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) with 95% CIs alongside area under the curve (AUC) of a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were calculated. The initial analysis took place throughout December 2023. Of 440 initially identified articles, 6 met inclusion criteria and demonstrated moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 36%) with low risk of bias and low applicability concerns. Overall, 263 total patients were included with a median (range) age of 58 (39-86) years, and 228 (87%) were male patients. Per updated prognostic staging criteria, localized tumors (ie, stages 1 or 2) comprised most cancers at 139 (77%), whereas advanced ones (ie, stages 3 or 4) comprised the remaining 41 (23%). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and DOR values were 64% (95% CI, 36%-85%), 89% (95% CI, 46%-99%), 11.70 (95% CI, 0.37-77.00), 1.21 (95% CI, 0.08-7.00), and 139.00 (95% CI, 0.05-837.00), respectively.

Does photobiomodulation alter mitochondrial dynamics?,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the leading causes of disease development. Dysfunctional mitochondria limit energy production, increase reactive oxygen species generation, and trigger apoptotic signals. Photobiomodulation is a noninvasive, nonthermal technique involving the application of monochromatic light with low energy density, inducing non-thermal photochemical effects at the cellular level, and it has been used due to its therapeutic potential. This review focuses on the mitochondrial dynamic's role in various diseases, evaluating the possible therapeutic role of low-power lasers (LPL) and light-emitting diodes (LED). Studies increasingly support that mitochondrial dysfunction is correlated with severe neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases. Furthermore, a disturbance in mitofusin activity is also associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes. The effects of PBM on mitochondrial dynamics have been observed in cells using a human fibroblast cell line and in vivo models of brain injury, diabetes, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, and skin injury. Thus, new therapies aiming to improve mitochondrial dynamics are clinically relevant.

[Sensitivity of colorectal cancer organoids to hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with lobaplatin].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the sensitivity of tumor organoids derived from samples of colorectal cancer to lobaplatin and oxaliplatin hyperthermic perfusion <i>in vitro</i> and to assist clinical development of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. <b>Method:</b> Tumor samples and relevant clinical data were collected from patients with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer in the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from July 2021 to December 2022. Organoids were cultured and tumor tissue were passaged. <i>In vitro</i> hyperthermic perfusion experiments were performed on organoids with good viability. Firstly, 10 organoids were treated with oxaliplatin and lobaplatin at the following six concentrations: 1 000, 250, 62.5, 15.6, 3.9, and 0.98 μmol/L. The organoids were exposed to oxaliplatin at 42℃ for 30 minutes and to lobaplatin at 42℃ for 60 minutes. Dose-response curves of responses to in vitro hyperthermic perfusion with these two drugs were constructed and evaluated. Clinical doses of oxaliplatin and lobaplatin were further tested on 30 organoids. This testing revealed oxaliplatin was effective at 579 µmol/L at a hyperthermic perfusion temperature of 42℃ for 30 min and lobaplatin was effective at 240 µmol/L at a hyperthermic perfusion temperature of 42℃ for 60 minutes. <b>Result:</b> Thirty-two tumor organoids were cultured from samples of colorectal cancer. The median concentration required for oxaliplatin to eliminate 50% of tumor cells (IC50) was 577.45 µmol/L (IQR: 1846.09 µmol/L). The median IC50 for lobaplatin was 85.04 µmol/L (IQR: 305.01 µmol/L).The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (<i>Z</i>=1.784, <i>P</i>=0.084). In seven of 10 organoids, lobaplatin showed a greater IC50 after in vitro hyperthermic perfusion than did oxaliplatin. Testing of 30 organoids with clinical doses of oxaliplatin and lobaplatin revealed that oxaliplatin achieved an average inhibition rate of 39.6% (95%CI: 32.1%‒47.0%), whereas the average rate of inhibition for lobaplatin was 89.7% (95%CI: 87.0%‒92.3%): this difference is statistically significant (<i>t</i>=‒15.282, <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The rate of inhibition achieved by hyperthermic perfusion of lobaplatin <i>in vitro</i> is better than that achieved by hyperthermic perfusion with oxaliplatin. Lobaplatin is more effective than oxaliplatin when administered by hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion and therefore has the potential to replace oxaliplatin in this setting.",['Liu D; Wang H; Deng WH; Lan JQ; Song ZW; Zhu Y; Jing JL; Cai J'],2024,tumor organoids were exposed to oxaliplatin and lobaplatin. oxaliplatin was effective at 579 mol/L at 42°C for 30 min. oxaliplatin was effective at 579 mol/L at a hyperthermic perfusion temperature of 42°C for 30 min.
Osimertinib and palbociclib in an EGFR-mutated NSCLC with primary CDK4 amplification after progression under osimertinib.,"Precision cancer medicine has changed the treatment paradigm of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific molecular aberrations. A major challenge is management of the resistance that tumor cells eventually develop against targeted therapies, either through primary or acquired resistance mechanisms. We report a 61 year-old male patient with metastatic NSCLC harboring an EGFR exon 19 deletion, a PIK3CA mutation, and CDK4 amplification. After an initial partial response to osimertinib as mono-therapy (third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), the patient had progression of disease after 4 months of treatment and was referred for combined osimertinib and palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) treatment. Though complicated by transient pneumonitis, the patient has an ongoing partial response for > 10 months and has experienced clinical improvement on this treatment regimen. As amplification of CDK4 occurs in ~ 10% of treatment-naïve patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, the successful treatment of our patient with osimertinib and palbociclib may be highly relevant for future patients with NSCLC.",['de Jager VD; Stigt JA; Niemantsverdriet M; Ter Elst A; van der Wekken AJ'],2024,"a 61 year-old male patient with metastatic NSCLC harbors an EGFR exon 19 deletion, a PIK3CA mutation, and CDK4 amplification. the patient had progression of disease after 4 months of treatment."
Single-Port One Anastomosis Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition: Initial Experience and Technique.,"Sleeve gastrectomy with transit bipartition (SG-TB) procedure has been gaining traction recently. While being a relatively novel procedure, it shows potentials to improve the standalone SG outcomes, such as diabetes remission and reflux. This article aims to show insights on performing SG-TB in one anastomosis fashion (SG-OATB) and single-port approach. Three patients who underwent laparoscopic single-port SG-OATB at our hospital were included. The parameters included in this study comprised of age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) assessment, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) assessment, length of the small bowel, the duration of the procedure, and 30-day readmission rate. The mean preoperative assessments for the three patients were as follows: two females vs. one male; age 38.7 ± 5.5 years old; weight 105.7 ± 5.4 kg; height 1.64 ± 0.11 m; BMI 39.3 ± 4.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; fasting blood glucose 6.7 ± 1.2 mmol/L; glycosylated hemoglobin level 7.1 ± 1.3%; GERD-Questionnaire score 6.3 ± 1.5; two patients with esophagitis grade A and B following endoscopy. The total duration of the procedure was 170.0 ± 26.5 min; there was no need for conversion to multiple-port in all patients. The 30-day readmission rate for all patients was 0%. In our small cases of patients, single-port SG-OATB is feasible and safe. We found the closure of the anastomosis defect to be most technically demanding. To understand better the outcome of single-port SG-OATB, studies with larger sample and longer follow-up will be needed in the future.",['Widjaja J; Yang J; Dong W; Wang R; Yang D; Song Z; Gu Y'],2024,"three patients underwent laparoscopic single-port SG-OATB at our hospital. the parameters included included age, gender, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes mellitus assessment, length of the small bowel, the duration of the procedure, and 30-day readmission rate."
A site-specific phosphorylation in FSTL1 determines its promigratory role in wound healing.,"Follistatin like-1 (FSTL-1) is a secreted glycoprotein of mesenchymal in origin. In human skin, FSTL1 is upregulated in the epidermal keratinocytes upon acute injury and is required for the migration of keratinocytes. Failure to upregulate FSTL1 leads to the lack of keratinocyte migration and the non- healing nature of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). FSTL1 undergoes extensive post-translational modification (PTM) at specific residues. Glycosylation at N144, N175 and N180, are the only experimentally demonstrated PTM in FSTL1, wherein, N180 and N144 glycosylations have been found to be critical for its function in cardiac tissue regeneration and pre-adipocyte differentiation, respectively. However, it is not known if PTMs other than glycosylation occurs in FSTL1 and how it impacts its pro-migratory function. Using in-silico analysis of mass spectrometric datasets, we found a novel PTM, namely, Serine 165 (S165) phosphorylation in FSTL1. To address the role of S165 phosphorylation in its pro-migratory function, a phosphorylation defective mutant of FSTL1 (S165A) was constructed by converting serine 165 to alanine and over expressed in 293T cells. S165A mutation did not affect the secretion of FSTL1 in vitro. However, S165A abolished the pro-migratory effect of FSTL1 in cultured keratinocytes likely via its inability to facilitate ERK signaling pathway. Interestingly, bacterially expressed recombinant FSTL1, trans-dominantly inhibited wound closure in keratinocytes highlighting the prime role of FSTL1 phosphorylation for its pro-migratory function. Further, under high glucose conditions, which inhibited scratchwound migration of keratinocytes, we noticed a significant decrease in S165 phosphorylation. Taken together, our results reveal a hitherto unreported role of FSTL1 phosphorylation PTM with profound implications in wound healing.",['Suresh AP; Vijayarengan M; Aggarwal P; Soundaram R; Gnanesh Kumar BS; Sundaram GM'],2024,FSTL1 is upregulated in the epidermal keratinocytes upon acute injury. failure to upregulate FSTL1 leads to the lack of keratinocyte migration.

TNA-Mediated Antisense Strategy to Knockdown Akt Genes for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Therapy.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a significant challenge in terms of treatment, with limited efficacy of chemotherapy due to side effects and acquired drug resistance. In this study, a threose nucleic acid (TNA)-mediated antisense approach is employed to target therapeutic Akt genes for TNBC therapy. Specifically, two new TNA strands (anti-Akt2 and anti-Akt3) are designed and synthesized that specifically target Akt2 and Akt3 mRNAs. These TNAs exhibit exceptional enzymatic resistance, high specificity, enhance binding affinity with their target RNA molecules, and improve cellular uptake efficiency compared to natural nucleic acids. In both 2D and 3D TNBC cell models, the TNAs effectively inhibit the expression of their target mRNA and protein, surpassing the effects of scrambled TNAs. Moreover, when administered to TNBC-bearing animals in combination with lipid nanoparticles, the targeted anti-Akt TNAs lead to reduced tumor sizes and decreased target protein expression compared to control groups. Silencing the corresponding Akt genes also promotes apoptotic responses in TNBC and suppresses tumor cell proliferation in vivo. This study introduces a novel approach to TNBC therapy utilizing TNA polymers as antisense materials. Compared to conventional miRNA- and siRNA-based treatments, the TNA system holds promise as a cost-effective and scalable platform for TNBC treatment, owing to its remarkable enzymatic resistance, inexpensive synthetic reagents, and simple production procedures. It is anticipated that this TNA-based polymeric system, which targets anti-apoptotic proteins involved in breast tumor development and progression, can represent a significant advancement in the clinical development of effective antisense materials for TNBC, a cancer type that lacks effective targeted therapy.",['Li P; Zheng S; Leung HM; Liu LS; Chang TJH; Maryam A; Wang F; Chin YR; Lo PK'],2024,"a threose nucleic acid-mediated antisense approach is employed to target therapeutic Akt genes for TNBC therapy. the strands are designed and synthesized that specifically target Akt2 and Akt3 mRNAs. these TNAs exhibit exceptional enzymatic resistance, high specificity, enhance binding affinity with their target RNA molecules."
Heat Exposure and Cause-Specific Hospital Admissions in Spain: A Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study.,"More frequent and intense exposure to extreme heat conditions poses a serious threat to public health. However, evidence on the association between heat and specific diagnoses of morbidity is still limited. We aimed to comprehensively assess the short-term association between cause-specific hospital admissions and high temperature, including the added effect of temperature variability and heat waves and the effect modification by humidity and air pollution. We used data on cause-specific hospital admissions, weather (i.e., temperature and relative humidity), and air pollution [i.e., fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>≤</mo><mn>2.5</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2.5</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>), fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>≤</mo><mn>10</mn><mspace></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>), <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>NO</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>, and ozone (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>O</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>)] for 48 provinces in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2019. The statistical analysis was performed for the summer season (June-September) and consisted of two steps. We first applied quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression models in combination with distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) to estimate province-specific temperature-morbidity associations, which were then pooled through multilevel univariate/multivariate random-effect meta-analysis. High temperature had a generalized impact on cause-specific hospitalizations, while the added effect of temperature variability [i.e., diurnal temperature range (DTR)] and heat waves was limited to a reduced number of diagnoses. The strongest impact of heat was observed for metabolic disorders and obesity [relative risk (RR) = 1.978; 95% empirical confidence interval (eCI): 1.772, 2.208], followed by renal failure (1.777; 95% eCI: 1.629, 1.939), urinary tract infection (1.746; 95% eCI: 1.578, 1.933), sepsis (1.543; 95% eCI: 1.387, 1.718), urolithiasis (1.490; 95% eCI: 1.338, 1.658), and poisoning by drugs and nonmedicinal substances (1.470; 95% eCI: 1.298, 1.665). We also found differences by sex (depending on the diagnosis of hospitalization) and age (very young children and the elderly were more at risk). Humidity played a role in the association of heat with hospitalizations from acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis and diseases of the muscular system and connective tissue, which were higher in dry days. Moreover, heat-related effects were exacerbated on high pollution days for metabolic disorders and obesity (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>2.5</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>) and diabetes (<math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mrow><mi>PM</mi></mrow></mrow><mrow><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mrow><msub><mrow><mi>O</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow></math>). Short-term exposure to heat was found to be associated with new diagnoses (e.g., metabolic diseases and obesity, blood diseases, acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, muscular and connective tissue diseases, poisoning by drugs and nonmedicinal substances, complications of surgical and medical care, and symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions) and previously identified diagnoses of hospital admissions.

Targeting WEE1 enhances the antitumor effect of KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer harboring TP53 mutations.,"The clinical development of Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS)-G12C inhibitors for the treatment of KRAS-mutant lung cancer is limited by the presence of co-mutations, intrinsic resistance, and the emergence of acquired resistance. Therefore, innovative strategies for enhancing apoptosis in KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are urgently needed. Through CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening using a library of 746 crRNAs and drug screening with a custom library of 432 compounds, we discover that WEE1 kinase inhibitors are potent enhancers of apoptosis, particularly in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells harboring TP53 mutations. Mechanistically, WEE1 inhibition promotes G2/M transition and reduces checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) and Rad51 expression in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is associated with apoptosis and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, leading to mitotic catastrophe. Notably, the combined inhibition of KRAS-G12C and WEE1 consistently suppresses tumor growth. Our results suggest targeting WEE1 as a promising therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutated NSCLC with TP53 mutations.",['Fukuda K; Takeuchi S; Arai S; Nanjo S; Sato S; Kotani H; Kita K; Nishiyama A; Sakaguchi H; Ohtsubo K; Yano S'],2024,"kinase inhibitors are potent enhancers of apoptosis, particularly in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells harboring TP53 mutations. the combined inhibition of KRAS-G12C and WEE1 consistently suppresses tumor growth."
A splice site variant in MADD affects hormone expression in pancreatic β cells and pituitary gonadotropes.,"MAPK activating death domain (MADD) is a multifunctional protein regulating small GTPases RAB3 and RAB27, MAPK signaling, and cell survival. Polymorphisms in the MADD locus are associated with glycemic traits, but patients with biallelic variants in MADD manifest a complex syndrome affecting nervous, endocrine, exocrine, and hematological systems. We identified a homozygous splice site variant in MADD in 2 siblings with developmental delay, diabetes, congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. This variant led to skipping of exon 30 and in-frame deletion of 36 amino acids. To elucidate how this mutation causes pleiotropic endocrine phenotypes, we generated relevant cellular models with deletion of MADD exon 30 (dex30). We observed reduced numbers of β cells, decreased insulin content, and increased proinsulin-to-insulin ratio in dex30 human embryonic stem cell-derived pancreatic islets. Concordantly, dex30 led to decreased insulin expression in human β cell line EndoC-βH1. Furthermore, dex30 resulted in decreased luteinizing hormone expression in mouse pituitary gonadotrope cell line LβT2 but did not affect ontogeny of stem cell-derived GnRH neurons. Protein-protein interactions of wild-type and dex30 MADD revealed changes affecting multiple signaling pathways, while the GDP/GTP exchange activity of dex30 MADD remained intact. Our results suggest MADD-specific processes regulate hormone expression in pancreatic β cells and pituitary gonadotropes.",['Pulli K; Saarimäki-Vire J; Ahonen P; Liu X; Ibrahim H; Chandra V; Santambrogio A; Wang Y; Vaaralahti K; Iivonen AP; Känsäkoski J; Tommiska J; Kemkem Y; Varjosalo M; Vuoristo S; Andoniadou CL; Otonkoski T; Raivio T'],2024,a multifunctional protein regulating small GTPases RAB3 and RAB27. a homozygous splice site variant in MADD in 2 siblings. this variant led to skipping of exon 30 and in-frame deletion of 36 amino acids.
Unraveling genetic causality between metformin and myocardial infarction on the basis of Mendelian randomization.,"In recent years, several studies have explored the effect of metformin on myocardial infarction (MI), but whether metformin has an improvement effect in patients with MI is controversial. This study was aimed to investigate the causal relationship between metformin and MI using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. The genome-wide significant (<i>P</i><5×10<sup>-8</sup>) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients with metformin and patients with MI were screened from the Open genome-wide association study (GWAS) project as instrumental variables (IVs). The study outcomes mainly included MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to assess the main causal effect, and weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode methods, and MR-Egger regression were auxiliary applied for supplementary proof. The causal relationship between metformin and MI was assessed using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A leave-one-out method was used to explore the effect of individual SNPs on the results of IVW analyses, and a funnel plot was used to analyze the potential bias of the study results, thus ensuring the robustness of the results. In total, 16, 84, 39, 26, and 34 SNPs were selected as IVs to assess the genetic association between metformin and outcomes of MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall, respectively. Treatment with metformin does not affect the risk of acute transmural MI of anterior wall at the genetic level (<i>P</i>>0.05; OR for inverse variance weighted was 1.010). In the cases of MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall, metformin may even be a risk factor for patients (<i>P</i><0.05; ORs for inverse variance weighted were 1.078, 1.026, 1.022 and 1.018 respectively). There was no horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity among IVs. The results were stable when removing the SNPs one by one. Metformin is not protective against the risk of myocardial infarction in patients and may even be a risk factor for MI, old MI, acute MI, and acute transmural MI of inferior wall.",['Zhuang Y; Pan X; Chen Y; Song J'],2024,"metformin has a positive effect on myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with metformin. the genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were screened as instrumental variables. the results included MI, old MI, acute MI, acute transmural MI of inferior wall, and acute transmural MI of anterior wall."

Triiodothyronine/Thyroxine Ratio as a Marker of Clinical Response to Levothyroxine Replacement in Patients With Hypothyroidism.," Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders with a simple therapy, that is levothyroxine (LT4). A normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is used as a marker of optimal replacement. But, many patients still have symptoms. Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and their ratio may correlate with clinical improvement. The study aims to assess the T3/T4 ratio as a marker of clinical response in patients with hypothyroidism.  Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to November 2022 at Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine, and Metabolism Center, in Basrah, southern Iraq. We included 48 adult patients with primary hypothyroidism on LT4 treatment only and TSH within the target reference range for at least within the last six months. Each patient was subjected to a questionnaire that was designed to capture hypothyroidism-related complaints in the form of a five-point Likert scale. Biochemical assessments were done with the measurement of TSH, T3, and T4. Despite having a normal TSH level, nearly all the patients had persistent and varying severity of clinical complaints of hypothyroidism. Tiredness, hair problems, weight gain, and cold intolerance were the most severely persistent symptoms. Patients with scores of two and more for weight gain, cold intolerance, and skin problems had significantly lower T3/T4 ratios (P = 0.04, 0.002, and 0.02, respectively), while in the remaining clinical symptoms, the T3/T4 ratio did not differ significantly. A low T3/T4 ratio was significantly associated with resistant symptoms of hypothyroidism and may be used as a marker for treatment efficacy with TSH rather than TSH value alone.",['Hadi ZM; Alidrisi HA; Mansour AA'],2024,a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is used as a marker of optimal replacement. but many patients still have symptoms. the study aims to assess the T3/T4 ratio as a marker of clinical response in patients with hypothyroidism.
Effect of fecal immunochemical test cut-off levels on adenoma detection rate: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is higher after a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) compared to direct screening colonoscopy. This meta-analysis evaluated how ADR, the rates of advanced adenoma detection (AADR), colorectal cancer detection (CDR), and sessile serrated lesion detection (SSLDR) are affected by different FIT positivity thresholds. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and EBM Reviews databases for studies reporting ADR, AADR, CDR, and SSLDR according to different FIT cut-off values in asymptomatic average-risk individuals aged 50-74 years old. Data were stratified according to sex, age, time to colonoscopy, publication year, continent, and FIT kit type. Study quality, heterogeneity, and publication bias were assessed. Overall, 4280 articles were retrieved and fifty-eight studies were included (277,661 FIT-positive colonoscopies; mean cecal intubation 96.3%; mean age 60.8 years; male 52.1%). Mean ADR was 56.1% (95% CI 53.4 - 58.7%), while mean AADR, CDR, and SSLDR were 27.2% (95% CI 24.4 - 30.1%), 5.3% (95% CI 4.7 - 6.0%), and 3.0% (95% CI 1.7 - 4.6%), respectively. For each 20 μg Hb/g increase in FIT cut-off level, ADR increased by 1.54% (95% CI 0.52 - 2.56%, <i>p</i> < 0.01), AADR by 3.90% (95% CI 2.76 - 5.05%, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and CDR by 1.46% (95% CI 0.66 - 2.24%, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Many detection rates were greater amongst males and Europeans.

Omaveloxolone Prevents Polystyrene Microplastic-Induced Ovarian Granulosa Cell Apoptosis via the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway in Rats.,"Microplastics (MPs) are persistent environmental pollutants that enter the circulatory system and subsequently reduce sperm quantity and quality. However, the influence of polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) on the ovary and relevant mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we aimed to examine the impact of PS-MPs on oxidative disorders in ovarian tissues and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Healthy female rats were treated with different concentrations of 0.5 µm PS-MPs (diluted in deionized H<sub>2</sub>O) for 90 days. Upon examination of hematoxylin-eosin-stained ovarian tissue sections, the number of growing follicles was reduced in PS-MP-treated rats when compared with that in control rats. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that PS-MP exposure markedly reduced anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels. Treatment with PS-MPs downregulated superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase activities in ovarian tissues while upregulating malondialdehyde levels. Furthermore, exposure to PS-MP blocked the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signal transduction pathway. PS-MPs also triggered apoptosis in the ovarian tissue, as evidenced by increased TUNEL staining and expression levels of cleaved caspase-9, Bax, and Bcl-2. To reactivate the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, rats were co-administered PS-MPs and omaveloxolone (Oma), an Nrf2 activator, for 1 week. We found that Oma could counteract the PS-MP-mediated effects on oxidative disorder, apoptosis, AMH production, and follicle number in rat ovarian tissues. To develop an in vitro model, granulosa cells (GCs) were treated with 10 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 12 h to induce oxidative stress. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-stimulated GCs exhibited attenuated cell growth and upregulated apoptosis and oxidative stress. Oma administration could ameliorate the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced effects in terms of regulating cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in GCs. In summary, PS-MPs could induce apoptosis and oxidative stress via the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in both rats and GCs.",['Li B; Tan S; Yu X; Wang Y'],2024,apoptosis in the ovarian tissue is a sign of apoptosis. apoptosis in the ovarian tissue is a sign of apoptosis.
Analysis of prognostic value of lactate metabolism-related genes in ovarian cancer based on bioinformatics.,"Recent studies have provided evidence supporting the functional role and mechanism of lactate in suppressing anticancer immunity. However, there is no systematic analysis of lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and ovarian cancer (OV) prognosis. Six genes (CCL18, CCND1, MXRA5, NRBP2, OLFML2B and THY1) were selected as prognostic genes and a prognostic model was utilized. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were further performed and indicated that the prognostic model was effective. Subsequently, the neoplasm_cancer_status and RiskScore were determined as independent prognostic factors, and a nomogram was established with relatively accurate forecasting ability. Additionally, 2 types of immune cells (Central memory CD8 T cell and Immature B cell), 4 types of immune functions (APC co inhibition, DCs, Tfh and Th1 cells), 9 immune checkpoints (BTLA, CTLA4, IDO1, LAG3, VTCN1, CXCL10, CXCL9, IFNG, CD27) and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) scores were significantly different between risk groups. The expression of 6 genes were verified by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and the expression of 6 genes were higher in the high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) samples. A prognostic model related to lactate metabolism was established for OV based on six genes (CCL18, CCND1, MXRA5, NRBP2, OLFML2B and THY1) that could provide new insights into therapy.",['Sun J; Feng Q; Xu Y; Liu P; Wu Y'],2024,lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and ovarian cancer (OV) prognosis were not studied. a prognostic model was used to determine the prognostic factor.
SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in the Nasopharynx at Time of First Infection Among Unvaccinated Individuals: A Secondary Cross-Protocol Analysis of 4 Randomized Trials.,"SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) in the nasopharynx is difficult to quantify and standardize across settings, but it may inform transmission potential and disease severity. To characterize VL at COVID-19 diagnosis among previously uninfected and unvaccinated individuals by evaluating the association of demographic and clinical characteristics, viral variant, and trial with VL, as well as the ability of VL to predict severe disease. This secondary cross-protocol analysis used individual-level data from placebo recipients from 4 harmonized, phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials sponsored by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax. Participants were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline and acquired COVID-19 during the blinded phase of the trials. The setting included the US, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Chile, and Mexico; start dates were July 27, 2020, to December 27, 2020; data cutoff dates were March 26, 2021, to July 30, 2021. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2022 to June 2023. Linear regression was used to assess the association of demographic and clinical characteristics, viral variant, and trial with polymerase chain reaction-measured log10 VL in nasal and/or nasopharyngeal swabs taken at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Among 1667 participants studied (886 [53.1%] male; 995 [59.7%] enrolled in the US; mean [SD] age, 46.7 [14.7] years; 204 [12.2%] aged 65 years or older; 196 [11.8%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 150 [9%] Black or African American, 1112 [66.7%] White; 762 [45.7%] Hispanic or Latino), median (IQR) log10 VL at diagnosis was 6.18 (4.66-7.12) log10 copies/mL. Participant characteristics and viral variant explained only 5.9% of the variability in VL. The independent factor with the highest observed differences was trial: Janssen participants had 0.54 log10 copies/mL lower mean VL vs Moderna participants (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.87 log10 copies/mL lower). In the Janssen study, which captured the largest number of COVID-19 events and variants and used the most intensive post-COVID surveillance, neither VL at diagnosis nor averaged over days 1 to 28 post diagnosis was associated with COVID-19 severity. In this study of placebo recipients from 4 randomized phase 3 trials, high variability was observed in SARS-CoV-2 VL at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and only a fraction was explained by individual participant characteristics or viral variant. These results suggest challenges for future studies of interventions seeking to influence VL and elevates the importance of standardized methods for specimen collection and viral load quantitation.",['Fisher LH; Kee JJ; Liu A; Espinosa CM; Randhawa AK; Ludwig J; Magaret CA; Robinson ST; Gilbert PB; Hyrien O; Kublin JG; Rouphael N; Falsey AR; Sobieszczyk ME; El Sahly HM; Grinsztejn B; Gray GE; Kotloff KL; Gay CL; Leav B; Hirsch I; Struyf F; Dunkle LM; Neuzil KM; Corey L; Huang Y; Goepfert PA; Walsh SR; Baden LR; Janes H'],2024,"nasopharynx population is characterized by a viral load (VL) in the nasopharynx. the nasopharynx is difficult to quantify and standardize across settings. a cross-protocol analysis used individual-level data from placebo recipients from 4 harmonized, phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials."
Efficacy of teplizumab for treatment of type 1 diabetes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a significant clinical challenge. This study evaluated the efficacy of teplizumab, an immunomodulatory drug, in patients with T1DM, using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. We systematically searched multiple databases including Medline, Scopus, and others up to 10 January 2024, without language or regional restrictions. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing teplizumab with placebo in T1DM patients. Our analysis incorporated 8 RCTs, predominantly involving participants aged 7-35 years, diagnosed with T1DM and treated with 14-day courses of teplizumab. The primary outcomes included insulin use, C-peptide levels, and HbA1c levels. We observed a significant reduction in insulin use in the teplizumab group standardised mean difference of -0.50 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: -0.76 to -0.23, p < 0.001; I2 = 49%). C-peptide levels were consistently higher in the teplizumab group, indicating improved endogenous insulin production. However, no significant change was noted in HbA1c levels between the groups. Quality assessment indicated a low risk of bias in most studies. Teplizumab has a significant impact on reducing insulin dependence and enhancing endogenous insulin production in T1DM patients. However, its effect on long-term glycaemic control, as indicated by HbA1c levels, remains inconclusive.",['Heidari E; Shafiee A; Noorian S; Rafiei MA; Abbasi M; Amini MJ; Safari O; Aghamahdi F; Bakhtiyari M'],2024,teplizumab is an immunomodulatory drug that can be used in patients with T1DM. the drug has a significant impact on reducing insulin dependence.
Oligopeptide-strategy of targeting at adipose tissue macrophages using ATS-9R/siCcl2 complex for ameliorating insulin resistance in GDM.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pregnancy-specific disease characterized by impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy. Although diagnosis and clinical management have improved significantly, there are still areas where therapeutic approaches need further improvement. Recent evidence suggests that CCL2, a chemokine involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes, is closely related to GDM. However, the potential value for clinical therapeutic applications and the mechanism of CCL2 in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) of GDM remain to be elucidated. Here, we found that CCL2 was enriched in macrophages of the visceral adipose tissue from GDM women and HFD-induced GDM mice. The combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that Ccl2 silencing inhibited the inflammatory response of macrophage by blocking calcium transport between ER and mitochondria and reducing excessive ROS generation. Additionally, the ATS-9R/siCcl2 oligopeptide complex targeting adipose tissue was created. Under the delivery of ATS-9R peptide, Ccl2 siRNA is expressed in ATMs, which reduces inflammation in adipose tissue and, as a result, mitigates insulin resistance. All of these findings point to the possibility that the ATS-9R/siCcl2 complex, which targets adipose tissue, is able to reduce insulin resistance in GDM and the inflammatory response in macrophages. The ATS-9R/siCcl2 oligopeptide complex targeting adipose tissue seems to be a viable treatment for GDM pregnancies.",['Wang M; Chen X; Shang Y; Chen B; Chen H; Zhou L; Li H; Zhang D; Tao B; Zhou X; Zhang H'],2024,adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) of GDM are enriched in adipose tissue. the chemokine involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes is closely related to GDM. but the potential value for clinical therapeutic applications remains to be elucidated.
Cutaneous Lagenidium deciduum infection in a patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.,"Lagenidium deciduum is an oomycete that can cause infections in mammals that present similarly to pythiosis and mucormycosis. Most of the existing case reports have occurred in canines and have been fatal. In animals, medical therapy has not been successful, so surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment. Lagenidium sp. infections in humans are rare. There is only one case of a human Lagenidium sp. infection in the literature, and it presented as an ocular infection. The human ocular infection was resistant to medical therapy and required a penetrating keratoplasty for cure. Additional reports of effective therapy are needed to guide management of this emerging pathogen. We present the first case of a cutaneous Lagenidium deciduum infection in a human patient, which is also the first documented case of a Lagenidium deciduum infection in an immunocompromised host of any species. An 18-year-old female with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, awaiting a haploidentical stem cell transplant, presented with erythematous cutaneous lesions on her left hip and bilateral buttocks that enlarged and blackened over several days. About 1 week later, boil-like lesions appeared on her bilateral buttocks. The skin lesions were initially presumed to be bacterial in origin, so the patient was treated with clindamycin and cefepime with little improvement. Upon further investigation, fungal cultures and skin biopsies revealed aseptate hyphae, so the patient was switched to isavuconazole and amphotericin B due to concern for mucormycosis. Phenotypic characterization and DNA sequencing were performed by the Fungus Testing Laboratory, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, which identified the causal fungal organism as Lagenidium deciduum. All of her cutaneous lesions were surgically excised, and the patient was treated with micafungin, terbinafine, doxycycline, and azithromycin. Micafungin and terbinafine were continued until she achieved engraftment post-transplant. We report the first successful treatment of a human Lagenidium infection in an immunocompromised host through a combination of aggressive surgical excision and prolonged antifungal therapy during the prolonged neutropenia associated with allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Clinical outcomes and phenotypes of respiratory failure in older subjects admitted to an acute care geriatric hospital ward.,"Respiratory failure (RF) is frequent in hospitalized older patients, but was never systematically investigated in large populations of older hospitalized patients. We conducted a retrospective administrative study based on hospitalizations of a Geriatrics Unit regarding 2014, 2015, and 2016. Patients underwent daily screening for hypoxia. Hospital discharge records were coded through a standardized methodology. RF, defined as documented hypoxia on room air, was always coded, whenever present. We investigated how RF affected clinical outcomes, whether RF grouped into specific comorbidity phenotypes, and how phenotypes associated with the outcomes. RF was coded in 48.6% of the 1,810 hospitalizations. RF patients were older and more frequently had congestive heart failure (CHF: 49 vs 23%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD: 27 vs 6%), pneumonia (14 vs 4%), sepsis (12 vs 7%), and pleural effusion (6 vs 3%), than non-RF patients. RF predicted longer length of stay (a-Beta 2.05, 95% CI 1.4-2.69; p < 0.001) and higher in-hospital death/intensive care units (ICU) need (aRR 7.12, 5-10.15; p < 0.001) after adjustment for confounders (linear and Poisson regression with robust error variance). Among RF patients, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, electrolyte disturbances, sepsis, and non-invasive ventilation predicted increased, while CHF and COPD predicted decreased in-hospital death/ICU need. The ONCO (cancer) and Mixed (cerebrovascular disease, dementia, pneumonia, sepsis, electrolyte disturbances, bedsores) phenotypes displayed higher in-hospital death/ICU need than CARDIO (CHF) and COPD phenotypes. In this study, RF predicted increased hospital death/ICU need and longer hospital stay, but also reflected diverse underlying conditions and clinical phenotypes that accounted for different clinical courses.",['Fimognari FL; De Vincentis A; Arone A; Baffa Bellucci F; Ricchio R; Antonelli Incalzi R'],2024,"RF was coded in 48.6% of 1,810 hospitalizations.

Genetic Association between Lipid-Regulating Drug Targets and Diabetic Retinopathy: A Drug Target Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a diabetic microvascular complication and a leading cause of vision loss. However, there is a lack of effective strategies to reduce the risk of DR currently. The present study is aimed at assessing the causal effect of lipid-regulating targets on DR risk using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Genetic variants within or near drug target genes, including eight lipid-regulating targets for LDL-C (HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1), HDL-C (CETP, SCARB1, and PPARG), and TG (PPARA and LPL), were selected as exposures. The exposure data were obtained from the IEU OpenGWAS project. The outcome dataset related to DR was obtained from the FinnGen research project. Inverse-variance-weighted MR (IVW-MR) was used to calculate the effect estimates by each target. Sensitivity analyses were performed to verify the robustness of the results. There was suggestive evidence that PCSK9-mediated LDL-C levels were positively associated with DR, with OR (95% CI) of 1.34 (1.02-1.77). No significant association was found between the expression of HMGCR- and NPC1L1-mediated LDL-C levels; CETP-, SCARB1-, and PPARG-mediated HDL-C levels; PPARA- and LPL-mediated TG levels; and DR risk. This is the first study to reveal a genetically causal relationship between lipid-regulating drug targets and DR risk. PCSK9-mediated LDL-C levels maybe positively associated with DR risk at the genetic level. This study provides suggestive evidence that PCSK9 inhibition may reduce the risk of DR.",['Chen S; Zhang M; Yang P; Guo J; Liu L; Yang Z; Nan K'],2024,"a study aimed at assessing the causal effect of lipid-regulating targets on DR risk using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study. genetic variants within or near drug target genes, including eight lipid-regulating targets for LDL-C (HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1), HDL-C (CETP, SCARB1 and PPARG) and TG (PPARA and LPL) were selected as exposures."
"Investigating the effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 on clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis patients: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial- a pilot study.","The primary objective of this clinical trial was to assess whether administrating oral calcifediol (25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>) could enhance the clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This clinical trial was designed as a randomized, double-blind, two-arm study, with 25 participants receiving daily 50 μg of calcifediol and 25 people receiving daily 50 μg of cholecalciferol. The primary outcomes were serum levels of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, number of relapses, changes in Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 25-foot walk, and cognitive function. At the end of the trial, delta serum concentrations of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> were 85.32±40.94 ng/ml in the calcifediol group compared to 13.72±11.56 ng/ml in the cholecalciferol group; 84 % of the calcifediol group and none of the cholecalciferol group had circulating 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations exceeding 70 ng/ml. While both groups showed an overall trend towards improved cognitive function at the end of the study, the calcifediol group exhibited greater improvements in most cognitive tests. However, the trial had no significant beneficial effects on MS relapse, EDSS score, quality of life, or fatigue in either group, the calcifediol or cholecalciferol. The trial shows that calcifediol is more effective in rapidly increasing 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels in MS patients compared to cholecalciferol when administrated at a similar dosage.",['Maghbooli Z; Shirvani A; Moghadasi AN; Varzandi T; Hamtaei Ghashti S; Sahraian MA'],2024,"clinical trial was designed as a randomized, double-blind, two-arm study. 25 participants receiving daily 50 g of calcifediol and 25 people receiving daily 50 g of cholecalciferol. primary outcomes were serum levels of 25(OH)Dsub>3/sub>, number of relapses, changes in EDSS, the 25-foot walk, and cognitive function."
Fibroblasts' secretome from calcified and non-calcified dermis in Pseudoxanthoma elasticum differently contributes to elastin calcification.,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare disease characterized by ectopic calcification, however, despite the widely spread effect of pro/anti-calcifying systemic factors associated with this genetic metabolic condition, it is not known why elastic fibers in the same patient are mainly fragmented or highly mineralized in clinically unaffected (CUS) and affected (CAS) skin, respectively. Cellular morphology and secretome are investigated in vitro in CUS and CAS fibroblasts. Here we show that, compared to CUS, CAS fibroblasts exhibit: a) differently distributed and organized focal adhesions and stress fibers; b) modified cell-matrix interactions (i.e., collagen gel retraction); c) imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; d) differentially expressed pro- and anti-calcifying proteoglycans and elastic-fibers associated glycoproteins. These data emphasize that in the development of pathologic mineral deposition fibroblasts play an active role altering the stability of elastic fibers and of the extracellular matrix milieu creating a local microenvironment guiding the level of matrix remodeling at an extent that may lead to degradation (in CUS) or to degradation and calcification (in CAS) of the elastic component. In conclusion, this study contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms of the mineral deposition that can be also associated with several inherited or age-related diseases (e.g., diabetes, atherosclerosis, chronic kidney diseases).",['Lofaro FD; Costa S; Simone ML; Quaglino D; Boraldi F'],2024,ectopic calcification is a rare disease characterized by ectopic calcification. it is not known why elastic fibers in the same patient are mainly fragmented or highly mineralized in clinically unaffected skin. cellular morphology and secretome are investigated in vitro in CUS and CAS fibroblasts.
Peptide-Directed Synthesis of Aggregation-Induced Emission Enhancement-Active Gold Nanoclusters for Single- and Two-Photon Imaging of Lysosome and Expressed α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> Integrin Receptors.,"This study explores the synthesis and characterization of aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE)-active gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), focusing on their near-infrared luminescence properties and potential applications in biological imaging. These AIEE-active AuNCs were synthesized via the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-mediated reduction of HAuCl<sub>4</sub> in the presence of peptides. We systematically investigated the influence of the peptide sequence on the optical features of the AuNCs, highlighting the role of glutamic acid in enhancing their quantum yield (QY). Among the synthesized peptide-stabilized AuNCs, EECEE-stabilized AuNCs exhibited the maximum QY and a pronounced AIEE effect at pH 5.0, making them suitable for the luminescence imaging of intracellular lysosomes. The AIEE characteristic of the EECEE-stabilized AuNCs was demonstrated through examinations using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential analysis, and single-particle imaging. The formation of the EECEE-stabilized AuNCs was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry. Spectroscopic and electrochemical examinations uncover the formation process of EECEE-stabilized AuNCs, comprising EECEE-mediated reduction, NaBH<sub>4</sub>-induced nucleation, complex aggregation, and subsequent cluster growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of these AuNCs as luminescent probes for intracellular lysosomal imaging, leveraging their pH-responsive AIEE behavior. Additionally, cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD)-modified AIEE dots, derived from cyclic RGD-linked peptide-induced aggregation of EECEE-stabilized AuNCs, were developed for single- and two-photon luminescence imaging of α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> integrin receptor-positive cancer cells.",['Madhu M; Tseng WB; Chou YS; Krishna Kumar AS; Lu CY; Chang PL; Tseng WL'],2024,synthesis and characterization of aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE)-active gold nanoclusters. peptide-stabilized AuNCs exhibited maximum QY and pronounced AIEE effect at pH 5.0.
LncRNA AC100826.1 regulated PLCB1 to promote progression in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor. In the present study, we identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) AC100826.1 (simplify to Lnc1), which was highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues compared with the paracancerous tissues. We also observed the critical role of Lnc1 in regulating the metastasis ability of NSCLC cells. RNA sequencing was performed to detect differential expression levels of lncRNAs in NSCLC tissues and its paracancerous tissues. Effects of Lnc1 on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were determined by CCK-8, transwell and scratch assays. The xenograft experiment confirmed the effect of Lnc1 on NSCLC cells proliferation and migration abilities in vivo. RT-qPCR and western blots were performed to determine the expression levels of mRNAs and proteins. The expression level of Lnc1 was related to multiple pathological results, knockdown of Lnc1 can inhibit the proliferation and metastasis abilities of NSCLC cells. silencing phospholipase C, β1(PLCB1) can reverse the promoting effects of overexpression Lnc1 on NSCLC cells proliferation and migration abilities.

"Baseline characteristics and recruitment for SWOG S1820: altering intake, managing bowel symptoms in survivors of rectal cancer (AIMS-RC).","Many survivors of rectal cancer experience persistent bowel dysfunction. There are few evidence-based symptom management interventions to improve bowel control. The purpose of this study is to describe recruitment and pre-randomization baseline sociodemographic, health status, and clinical characteristics for SWOG S1820, a trial of the Altering Intake, Managing Symptoms in Rectal Cancer (AIMS-RC) intervention. SWOG S1820 aimed to determine the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of AIMS-RC, a symptom management intervention for bowel health, comparing intervention to attention control. Survivors with a history of cancers of the rectosigmoid colon or rectum, within 6-24 months of primary treatment completion, with a post-surgical permanent ostomy or anastomosis, and over 18 years of age were enrolled. Outcomes included total bowel function, low anterior resection syndrome, quality of life, motivation for managing bowel health, self-efficacy for managing symptoms, positive and negative affect, and study feasibility and acceptability. The trial completed accrual over a 29-month period and enrolled 117 participants from 34 institutions across 17 states and one US Pacific territory. At baseline, most enrolled participants reported self-imposed diet adjustments after surgery, persistent dietary intolerances, and bowel discomfort post-treatment, with high levels of constipation and diarrhea (grades 1-4). SWOG S1820 was able to recruit, in a timely manner, a study cohort that is demographically representative of US survivors of rectal cancer.

Fracture behavior of human cortical bone with high glycation content under dynamic loading.,"The present study simulates the fracture behavior of diabetic cortical bone with high levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) under dynamic loading. We consider that the increased AGEs in diabetic cortical bone degrade the materials heterogeneity of cortical bone through a reduction in critical energy release rates of the microstructural features. To simulate the initiation and propagation of cracks, we implement a phase field fracture framework on 2D models of human tibia cortical microstructure. The simulations show that the mismatch between the fracture properties (e.g., critical energy release rate) of osteons and interstitial tissue due to high AGEs contents can change crack growth trajectories. The results show crack branching in the cortical microstructure under dynamic loading is affected by the mismatches related to AGEs. In addition, we observe cortical features such as osteons and cement lines can prevent multiple cracking under dynamic loading even with changing the mismatches due to high AGEs. Furthermore, under dynamic loading, some toughening mechanisms can be activated and deactivated with different AGEs contents. In conclusion, the current findings present that the combination of the loading type and materials heterogeneity of microstructural features can change the fracture response of diabetic cortical bone and its fragility.",['Maghami E; Sadighi A; Najafi AR'],2024,"the study simulates the fracture behavior of diabetic cortical bone with high levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) under dynamic loading. the results show that the mismatch between the fracture properties (e.g., critical energy release rate) of osteons and interstitial tissue due to high AGEs contents can change crack growth trajectories."
"Clinical and functional characterization of a novel KCNJ11 (c.101G > A, p.R34H) mutation associated with maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 13.","This study aimed to describe the clinical features, diagnostic and therapeutic course of a patient with MODY13 caused by KCNJ11 (c.101G > A, p.R34H) and how it contributes to the pathogenesis of MODY13, and to explore new therapeutic targets. Whole-exome sequencing was used to screen prediagnosed individuals and family members with clinically suspected KCNJ11 mutations. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, western blotting, thallium flux of potassium channels, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and immunofluorescence assays were used to analyze the regulation of insulin secretion by the KCNJ11 mutant in MIN6 cells. Daily blood glucose levels were continuously monitored for 14 days in the proband using the ambulatory blood glucose meter (SIBIONICS). Mutation screening of the entire exon of the gene identified a heterozygous KCNJ11 (c.101G > A, p.R34H) mutation in the proband and his mother. Cell-based GSIS assays after transfection of MIN6 using wild-type and mutant plasmids revealed that this mutation impaired insulin secretory function. Furthermore, we found that this impaired secretory function is associated with reduced functional activity of the mutant KCNJ11 protein and reduced expression of the insulin secretion-associated exocytosis proteins STXBP1 and SNAP25. For the first time, we revealed the pathogenic mechanism of KCNJ11 (c.101G > A, p.R34H) associated with MODY13. This mutant can cause alterations in KATP channel activity, reduce sensitivity to glucose stimulation, and impair pancreatic β-cell secretory function by downregulating insulin secretion-associated exocytosis proteins. Therefore, oral sulfonylurea drugs can lower blood glucose levels through pro-insulinotropic effects and are more favorable for patients with this mutation.",['Lv X; Gao J; Yang J; Zou Y; Chen J; Sun Y; Song J; Liu Y; Wang L; Xia L; Yu S; Wei Z; Chen L; Hou X'],2024,"a patient with MODY13 with clinically suspected KCNJ11 mutations was screened. a whole-exome sequencing was used to screen prediagnosed individuals and family members with clinically suspected KCNJ11 mutations. the mutation impaired insulin secretory function, resulting in reduced functional activity of the mutant KCNJ11 protein."
Breaking bad news in oncology practice: experience and challenges of oncology health professionals in Ethiopia - an exploratory qualitative study.,"To explore the experience and challenges health professionals face during breaking bad news (BBN) to patients with cancer in the oncology centre of Black Lion Specialized Hospital (BLSH), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia 2019. An exploratory qualitative phenominological study using in-depth interviews was carried out in the only radiotherapy integrated oncology centre in Ethiopia during March 2019. Purposeful maximum variation sampling was used to select participants. OpenCode (V.4.02) assisted thematic analysis approach was employed to analyse the data. Eleven oncology health practitioners (oncologists, residents and nurses) working at the oncology centre were interviewed. Repeated interviews and analysis were done until theoretical saturation. All participants were cognisant of the positive outcome of proper and effective practice of BBN. However, they were practicing it empirically, no standardised protocols or guidelines were in place. Four dimensions of challenges were mentioned: (1) setup centric: unconducive environment, lack of protocols or guidelines, inaccessible treatment, and psychotherapy or counselling services; (2) health care centric, such as inadequate expertise, inadequate time due to patient load,treatment backlog, and referral system; (3) patients/family centric: poor medical literacy level, poor compliance, and family interference; and (4) sociocultural: wrong perception of families on BBN and treatment modalities, and opposition from religious leaders. BBN is challenging for professionals caring for patients in the oncology centre of BLSH. Hence, there is a critical need to improve practices. Change efforts may focus on the development of contextualised, content and context specific practice oriented training programmes and curriculum interventions. Raising awareness of the community and religious leaders regarding the nature and treatment of cancer may also be a helpful adjunct.",['Mulugeta T; Alemu W; Tigeneh W; Kaba M; Haileselassie W'],2024,a study was carried out in the only radiotherapy integrated oncology centre in Ethiopia. the results were analysed by opencode.
"Care for the caregiver: an exploration of caregiver burden of children with chronic medical conditions at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan - a mixed-methods study.","Caregiver burden often goes unrecognised and can substantially affect caregivers' physical, psychological and financial well-being, thereby impacting quality of care. This study investigates burden among caregivers of children with chronic medical conditions in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. The study aims to assess the extent of burden, explore influencing factors and recommendations for interventions. Mixed-methods study, comprising of an in-person paper-based survey, employing the Zarit Burden Interview scale to assess burden scores. Qualitative component included thematic analysis of semi-structured in-depth interviews with caregivers. 383 caregivers of children admitted to the inpatient paediatric services at our tertiary care centre were surveyed. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 caregivers. The survey revealed a mean burden score of 35.35±15.14, with nearly half of the participants (46%, n=177) experiencing mild burden, while 37% (n=140) reporting moderate-to-severe burden. The most common diagnosis was cancer (24%, n=92), while the highest burden (42.97±15.47) was noted for congenital cardiac disease. Greater burden was significantly associated with lower caregiver education, young age of the child at diagnosis and increased number of hospital visits (p<0.05). Caregivers highlighted financial strain, psychosocial effects and impact on lifestyle and relationships as key challenges. They emphasised the need for improved medical coordination, financial support and enhanced hospital services.

Network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation of the hypothalamus appetite-control network: a feasibility study.,"The hypothalamus is the key regulator for energy homeostasis and is functionally connected to striatal and cortical regions vital for the inhibitory control of appetite. Hence, the ability to non-invasively modulate the hypothalamus network could open new ways for the treatment of metabolic diseases. Here, we tested a novel method for network-targeted transcranial direct current stimulation (net-tDCS) to influence the excitability of brain regions involved in the control of appetite. Based on the resting-state functional connectivity map of the hypothalamus, a 12-channel net-tDCS protocol was generated (Neuroelectrics Starstim system), which included anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation. Ten participants with overweight or obesity were enrolled in a sham-controlled, crossover study. During stimulation or sham control, participants completed a stop-signal task to measure inhibitory control. Overall, stimulation was well tolerated. Anodal net-tDCS resulted in faster stop signal reaction time (SSRT) compared to sham (p = 0.039) and cathodal net-tDCS (p = 0.042). Baseline functional connectivity of the target network correlated with SSRT after anodal compared to sham stimulation (p = 0.016). These preliminary data indicate that modulating hypothalamus functional network connectivity via net-tDCS may result in improved inhibitory control.

Preoperative Risk Assessment of Early Kidney Graft Loss.,"A large proportion of potential organ donors are not utilized for kidney transplantation out of risk of early allograft loss because of donor-related characteristics. These can be summarized using kidney donor profile index (KDPI). Because KDPI affects the choice of the recipient, the predictive ability of KDPI is tied to recipient attributes. These have been questioned to explain most of the predictive ability of KDPI. This study aims to quantify the effect of the donor on early graft loss (EGL) by accounting for nonrandom allocation. This study included patients undergoing kidney transplantation from deceased donors between 2014 and 2020 from the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients. EGL, defined as a return to dialysis or retransplantation during the first posttransplant year, was the primary endpoint. Nonrandom allocation and donor-recipient matching by KDPI necessitated the use of inverse probability treatment weighting, which served to assess the effect of KDPI and mitigate selection bias in a weighted Cox regression model. The study comprised 89 290 transplantations in 88 720 individual patients. Inverse probability treatment weighting resulted in a good balance of recipient covariates across values of continuous KDPI. Weighted analysis showed KDPI to be a significant predictor for short-term outcomes. A comparable (in terms of age, time on dialysis, previous transplants, gender, diabetes status, computed panel-reactive antibodies, and HLA mismatches) average recipient, receiving a kidney from a donor with KDPI 40-60 had a 3.5% risk of EGL increased to a risk of 7.5% if received a kidney from a KDPI >95 donor (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-2.7). However, for all-cause survival KDPI was less influential. The predictive ability of KDPI does not stem from recipient confounding alone. In this large sample-sized study, modeling methods accounting for nonindependence of recipient selection verify graft quality to effectively predict short-term transplantation outcomes.",['Eerola V; Sallinen V; Lyden G; Snyder J; Lempinen M; Helanterä I'],2024,a large proportion of potential organ donors are not used for kidney transplantation out of risk of early allograft loss. the predictive ability of KDPI is tied to recipient attributes. this study aims to quantify the effect of the donor on early graft loss (EGL) by accounting for nonrandom allocation.

Communicating the diagnosis of a hematological neoplastic disease to patients' minor children: a multicenter prospective study.,"When a hematological malignancy is diagnosed, the whole family carries the burden of the disease; parents often try to protect minor children from suffering by avoiding communication about their disease. Since 2009, patients with minors at the Adult Hematology Division at San Gerardo Hospital (Monza) can take part in the ""Emanuela Project"": children can visit parents and talk with psychologists and hematologists, who explain the disease through simple metaphors. The EMY STUDY aimed to evaluate the impact of illness-related communication on children's behavior, comparing Monza's experience with other Hematology Units, where the communication is delegated to parents or psychological support. Questionnaires exploring the children's main behaviors (school performance, appetite, sleeping patterns, attachment to family figures, and family dialogue) were administered to both sick (SP) and healthy (HP) parents. From 2017 to 2021, 32 patients were enrolled, 20 from Monza and 12 from other hospitals; 84 questionnaires were globally collected. In Monza's group, no major changes in children's behavior were observed and an open dialogue about the disease was often possible. Disease communication is considered crucial and perceived as a responsibility of parents together with a professional figure, mainly the hematologist. Patients were satisfied with ""Emanuela Project,"" reporting positive effects on doctor-patient relationship. Difficulties in separation were significantly higher at other hospitals (P = .019) than in Monza. While at other centers communication is considered parents' responsibility, Monza's patients emphasize the role of professional figures (P = .007). Differently from other hospitals, the role of the hematologist is crucial to Monza's patients (P = .001). Disease communication to patients' offspring is a crucial moment in the process of care, and the hematologist can play a major role in this difficult task, with potential positive effects both on children's well-being and on doctor-patient relationship.",['Manghisi B; Borin L; Monaco MR; Sacco GGA; Antolini L; Mantegazza R; Barichello M; Mazza U; Zappasodi P; Onida F; Arcaini L; Cairoli R; Gambacorti Passerini C'],2024,children can visit parents and talk with psychologists and hematologists. children can talk with parents and explain the disease through simple metaphors. a hematological malignancy is a common problem in children.
Clinical Variables and Radiomics Features for Predicting Pneumothorax in Patients Undergoing CT-guided Transthoracic Core Needle Biopsy.,"Purpose To develop a prediction model combining both clinical and CT texture analysis radiomics features for predicting pneumothorax complications in patients undergoing CT-guided core needle biopsy. Materials and Methods A total of 424 patients (mean age, 65.6 years ± 12.7 [SD]; 232 male, 192 female) who underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy between January 2021 and October 2022 were retrospectively included as the training data set. Clinical and procedure-related characteristics were documented. Texture analysis radiomics features were extracted from the subpleural lung parenchyma traversed by needle. Moderate pneumothorax was defined as a postprocedure air rim of 2 cm or greater. The prediction model was developed using logistic regression with backward elimination, presented by linear fusion of the selected features weighted by their coefficients. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Validation was conducted in an external cohort (<i>n</i> = 45; mean age, 58.2 years ± 12.7; 19 male, 26 female) from a different hospital. Results Moderate pneumothorax occurred in 12.0% (51 of 424) of the training cohort and 8.9% (four of 45) of the external test cohort. Patients with emphysema (<i>P</i> < .001) or a longer needle path length (<i>P</i> = .01) exhibited a higher incidence of moderate pneumothorax in the training cohort.

Multiplex analysis for the identification of plasma protein biomarkers for predicting lung cancer immunotherapy response.,"Programmed death-ligand (PD-L1) expression serves as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) sensitivity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, the development of biomarkers that reliably predict ICI response remains an ongoing endeavor due to imperfections in existing methodologies. ICIs have led to a new paradigm in the treatment of NSCLC. The current companion PD-L1 diagnostics are insufficient in predicting ICI response. Therefore, we sought whether the Olink platform could be applied to predict response to ICIs in NSCLC. We collected blood samples from patients with NSCLC before ICI treatment and retrospectively analyzed proteomes based on their response to ICI. Overall, 76 NSCLC patients' samples were analyzed. Proteomic plasma analysis was performed using the Olink platform. Intraplate reproducibility, validation, and statistical analyses using elastic net regression and generalized linear models with clinical parameters were evaluated. Intraplate coefficient of variation (CV) assays ranged from 3% to 6%, and the interplate CV was 14%. In addition, the Pearson correlation coefficient of the Olink Normalized Protein eXpression data was validated. No statistical differences were observed in the analyses of progressive disease and response to ICIs. Furthermore, no single proteome showed prognostic value in terms of progression-free survival. In this study, the proximity extension assay-based approach of the Olink panel could not predict the patient's response to ICIs. Our proteomic analysis failed to achieve predictive value in both response or progression to ICIs and progression-free survival (PFS).",['Hong M; Lee SW; Cho BC; Hong MH; Lim SM; Kwon NJ'],2024,a new paradigm in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer is emerging. a proteomic analysis failed to achieve predictive predictive biomarker. a proteome of the ICI-linked panel was validated.
Pharmacogenomic predictor of long-term residual chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in ovarian cancer survivors: A substudy of the GINECO Vivrovaire study.,"Chemotherapy (CT) remains a backbone treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) inducing persistent peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Using a dedicated patient-reported outcome tool, this study investigated persistent CIPN and its pharmacogenetic predictors in a cohort of long-term EOC survivors. Vivrovaire was a French multicenter cohort of patients with EOC free of disease 3 years after CT completion. Persistent CIPN was assessed using the FACT/GOG-Ntx4 self-questionnaire. The association of homozygous (hom) or heterozygous (het) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in selected genes was evaluated. 130 patients were included with a median time from CT completion of 63 [35-180] months. The median CIPN score was 37 [18-44], with 35 (26.9%) patients reporting severe CIPN (<33). SNPs were identified as follows: CYP2C8 [hom, n = 32 (24.6%)/het, n = 99, (76.2%)]; CYP3A4 [hom, n = 0 (0%)/het, n = 8 (6.2%)], ERCC1 [hom, n = 21 (16.2%)/het, n = 57 (43.8%)], and XPC [hom, n = 45 (34.6%)/het, n = 66 (50.8%)]. In univariate analysis, the identification of ≥1 hom SNP was associated with a lower CIPN score (continuous variable; p = 0.045). Patients harboring hom or het CYP2C8_rs1934951 SNP reported more likely severe CIPN (threshold <33) score (OR 2.482; 95% CI [1.126-5.47], p = 0.024). In the multivariate analyses, age, interval from CT completion, type and number of CT courses were not significantly associated with CIPN score (OR 5.165, 95% CI [0.478-55.83], p = 0.176). Persistent CIPN is common among ovarian cancer long-term survivors. CYP2C8_rs1934951 SNP may be associated with severe residual CIPN in EOC survivors. More studies are warranted to identify predictive factors of CIPN.",['Zenatri M; Perennec T; Michon C; Gernier F; Grellard JM; Piloquet FX; Dubot-Poitelon C; Kalbacher E; Tredan O; Augereau P; Pautier P; Fey L; Joly F; Frenel JS'],2024,"vivrovaire was a french multicenter cohort of patients with EOC free of disease 3 years after CT completion. a dedicated patient-reported outcome tool investigated persistent CIPN and its pharmacogenetic predictors. a median CIPN score was 37 [18-44], with 35 (26.9%) patients reporting severe CIPN (33)"
Checkpoint inhibition enhances cell contacts between CD4+ T cells and Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg cells of classic Hodgkin lymphoma.,"Although checkpoint molecules like CTLA-4 and PD1 have been described several years ago, checkpoint inhibitors such as Nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) have only recently been used to treat classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Several studies have shown convincing therapeutic effects of Nivolumab in cHL. However, the mechanism of action of Nivolumab in cHL is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to monitor changes in cell motility and cell contacts after administration of Nivolumab to an in vitro model of cHL as well as to native hyperplastic lymphoid tissue and native human tissue from cHL. In both tissue and in vitro, CD4+, CD8+, CD30+ and CD20+ cell velocities were unchanged after Nivolumab incubation. In contrast, in primary cHL tissue, the duration of cell contacts between CD4+ T cells and HRS cells was significantly increased after 5 h Nivolumab treatment, and the number of contacts with HRS cells was also slightly increased for CD4+ T cells (not significant), suggesting that CD4+ T cells in particular contribute to the cytotoxicity observed as a result of Nivolumab therapy. There was no change in the duration of cell contacts in the hyperplastic lymphoid tissue after Nivolumab incubation. In conclusion, we show here for the first time by imaging of native lymphoma tissue an enhanced interaction of CD4+ T cells and HRS cells in cHL after Nivolumab administration.",['Yadigaroglu K; Scharf S; Gretser S; Schäfer H; Deli ASS; Loth AG; Yegoryan H; Schmitz R; Donnadieu E; Hansmann ML; Hartmann S'],2024,checkpoint molecules like CTLA-4 and PD1 have been described several years ago. but the mechanism of action of Nivolumab in cHL is not fully understood. the aim of this study was to monitor changes in cell motility and cell contacts after administration of Nivolumab to an in vitro model of cHL.
IGFBP7 promotes gastric cancer by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition of gastric cells.,"Gastric cancer (GC) with high morbidity and mortality is one major cause of tumor-related death. Mechanisms underlying GC invasion and metastasis remain unclear. IGFBP7 exerted variable effects in different cancers and its role in GC is controversial. Here, IGFBP7 was found to be upregulated and elevated IGFBP7 expression represented a poorer overall survival in GC using bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, IGFBP7 was up-regulated in human GC specimens and promoted tumor growth in xenograft tumor animals. For GC cell lines, we found that IGFBP7 was also upregulated and facilitated the cell malignant behavior and EMT of GC cells, which may involve NF-κB and ERK signaling pathways. This research may provide new avenues for GC therapy.",['Wang J; Wang X; Liu Z; Li S; Yin W'],2024,gastric cancer with high morbidity and mortality is one major cause of tumor-related death. mechanisms underlying GC invasion and metastasis remain unclear.
Clinical Outcomes and Dosimetric Evaluationof Interstitial Brachytherapyin Gynecological Malignancies.,"In management of Carcinoma Cervix, Brachytherapy plays a crucial role. Most commonly used technique is Intracavitary Brachytherapy (ICBT). In cases where ICBT is not technically feasible or it may result in suboptimal dose distribution, Interstitial Brachytherapy (ISBT) is recommended. With this study we wanted to study the clinical outcome and dosimetric details of interstitial brachytherapy in gynecological cancers. We analysed clinicaloutcome and dosimetric details of interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) done for gynecological malignancies in our institute during the period 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2020. Total of 42 interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) details were analysed.37 patients had Carcinoma Cervix and 5 patients had Carcinoma Vagina. In the majority of the patients, ISBT dosage schedule was three fractions 7Gy each. D2cc to rectum, bladder, sigmoid and bowel were 4.88 Gy, 5.62 Gy, 3.57 Gy and 2.47 Gy respectively. Mean CTV volume was 129.89 cc. EQD2 dose to CTV combining EBRT and ISBT dose was 85.88 Gy. D90 and D100 to CTV from ISBT were 111.96% and 68.21 % of prescribed dose respectively. Grade III/IV toxicities were seen in 5 (12%) patients. Local control rates at 1year &2 years were 88% & 85.7% respectively. DFS at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years were 80.7%, 72.3% and 65.7% respectively. OS at 1year, 2 years, 4 years and 5 years were 92.5%, 65.5%, 59.5% and 42.3% respectively. 3D imagebased dosimetry with CT based planning using MUPIT implant is a feasible option for gynecological malignancies warranting interstitial brachytherapy. In view of good clinical outcomes in terms of toxicity profile, Local control, DFS and OS with acceptable GEC-ESTRO dosimetric data, we recommend routine use interstitial brachytherapy if facilities are available and in clinical situations were ISBT is indicated.",['V VN; Dharmarajan A; Jones J; Yahiya EKN; Muttath G; Sneha N'],2024,ICBT is a technique used in management of carcinoma Cervix. a study of 42 interstitial brachytherapy details was carried out.
An observational study on the safety of teprotumumab based on FAERS database.,"Teprotumumab plays an important role in thyroid eye disease pathogenesis and progression. We intend to mine the adverse event (AE) signals from a relevant database, thereby contributing to the safe use of teprotumumab. The data obtained from the ASCII data packages in the FAERS database from January 2020 to the second quarter of 2023 were imported into the SAS software (version 9.4) for data cleaning and analysis. Disproportionality analysis was performed using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) in conjunction with the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) omnibus standard method to detect positive signals. This retrospective observational study relied on adverse drug reactions reported to the FDA through FAERS, which is a standard public system for spontaneous reporting. Collectively, 2171 AE reports for teprotumumab were collected, among which 108 significant signals were identified involving 17 system organ classes. The SOC of ear and labyrinth disorders included the most AE signals and reports. Muscle spasms, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, alopecia, blood glucose increased, hypoacusis, tinnitus, and diabetes mellitus were the top ten PTs ranked by the frequency of reporting, meanwhile, the two high-strength signals of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin increase (ROR 662.89, 95% CI 182.40-2409.19) and gingival recession (ROR 125.13, 95% CI 79.70-196.45) were not documented in the drug instruction. Meanwhile, we found a higher risk of increased blood glucose, deafness, and decreased appetite for male patients, and headache for female patients. Clinical application of teprotumumab should be closely monitored for ototoxicity, nail abnormalities, and menstrual changes, as well as for AEs not mentioned in the drug instruction, including gingival recession, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin increase, and so on.",['Wang XL; Xu SS; Zhou JB; Song ZH'],2024,teprotumumab plays an important role in thyroid eye disease pathogenesis and progression. the data obtained from the ASCII data packages were imported into the SAS software. the data was collected from the ASCII data packages in the FAERS database from January 2020 to the second quarter of 2023.
Reporting on patient's body mass index (BMI) in recent clinical trials for patients with breast cancer: a systematic review.,"The proportion of patients with breast cancer and obesity is increasing. While the therapeutic landscape of breast cancer has been expanding, we lack knowledge about the potential differential efficacy of most drugs according to the body mass index (BMI). Here, we conducted a systematic review on recent clinical drug trials to document the dosing regimen of recent drugs, the reporting of BMI and the possible exclusion of patients according to BMI, other adiposity measurements and/or diabetes (leading comorbidity of obesity). We further explored whether treatment efficacy was evaluated according to BMI. A search of Pubmed and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed to identify phase I-IV trials investigating novel systemic breast cancer treatments. Dosing regimens and exclusion based on BMI, adiposity measurements or diabetes, documentation of BMI and subgroup analyses according to BMI were assessed. 495 trials evaluating 26 different drugs were included. Most of the drugs (21/26, 81%) were given in a fixed dose independent of patient weight. BMI was an exclusion criterion in 3 out of 495 trials. Patients with diabetes, the leading comorbidity of obesity, were excluded in 67/495 trials (13.5%). Distribution of patients according to BMI was mentioned in 8% of the manuscripts, subgroup analysis was performed in 2 trials. No other measures of adiposity/body composition were mentioned in any of the trials. Retrospective analyses on the impact of BMI were performed in 6 trials. Patient adiposity is hardly considered as most novel drug treatments are given in a fixed dose. BMI is generally not reported in recent trials and few secondary analyses are performed. Given the prevalence of patients with obesity and the impact obesity can have on pharmacokinetics and cancer biology, more attention should be given by investigators and study sponsors to reporting patient's BMI and evaluating its impact on treatment efficacy and toxicity.",['Van Cauwenberge J; Van Baelen K; Maetens M; Geukens T; Nguyen HL; Nevelsteen I; Smeets A; Deblander A; Neven P; Koolen S; Wildiers H; Punie K; Desmedt C'],2024,the proportion of patients with breast cancer and obesity is increasing. we lack knowledge about the potential differential efficacy of most drugs according to the body mass index (BMI)
Icaritin-curcumol activates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through regulation of gut microbiota and the DNMT1/IGFBP2 axis to suppress the development of prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality rates are rising. Our previous research has shown that the combination of icariin (ICA) and curcumol (CUR) induced autophagy and ferroptosis in PCa cells, and altered lipid metabolism. We aimed to further explore the effects of the combination of ICA and CUR on gut microbiota, metabolism, and immunity in PCa. A mouse subcutaneous RM-1 cell tumor model was established. 16 S rRNA sequencing was performed to detect changes in fecal gut microbiota. SCFAs in mouse feces, and the effect of ICA-CUR on T-cell immunity, IGFBP2, and DNMT1 were examined. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was conducted to explore the mechanism of ICA-CUR. Si-IGFBP2 and si/oe-DNMT1 were transfected into RM-1 and DU145 cells, and the cells were treated with ICA-CUR to investigate the mechanism of ICA-CUR on PCa development. After treatment with ICA-CUR, there was a decrease in tumor volume and weight, accompanied by changes in gut microbiota. ICA-CUR affected SCFAs and DNMT1/IGFBP2/EGFR/STAT3/PD-L1 pathway. ICA-CUR increased the positive rates of CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>IFN-γ, CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>Ki67 cells, and the levels of IFN-γ and IFN-α in the serum. After FMT (with donors from the ICA-CUR group), tumor volume and weight were decreased. SCFAs promote tumor development and the expression of IGFBP2. In vitro, DNMT1/IGFBP2 promotes cell migration and proliferation. ICA-CUR inhibits the expression of DNMT1/IGFBP2. ICA-CUR mediates the interaction between gut microbiota and the DNMT1/IGFBP2 axis to inhibit the progression of PCa by regulating immune response and metabolism, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for PCa.",['Xu W; Li Y; Liu L; Xie J; Hu Z; Kuang S; Fu X; Li B; Sun T; Zhu C; He Q; Sheng W'],2024,icariin (ICA) and curcumol (CUR) induced autophagy and ferroptosis in PCa cells.

Machine learning-based integration develops an immunogenic cell death-derived lncRNA signature for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy response in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Accumulating evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment and early tumor development. Immunogenic cell death occurs mainly through the release or increase of tumor-associated antigen and tumor-specific antigen, exposing ""danger signals"" to stimulate the body's immune response. Given the recent development of immunotherapy in lung adenocarcinoma, we explored the role of tumor immunogenic cell death-related lncRNAs in lung adenocarcinoma for prognosis and immunotherapy benefit, which has never been uncovered yet. Based on the lung adenocarcinoma cohorts from the TCGA database and GEO database, the study developed the immunogenic cell death index signature by several machine learning algorithms and then validated the signature for prognosis and immunotherapy benefit of lung adenocarcinoma patients, which had a more stable performance compared with published signatures in predicting the prognosis, and demonstrated predictive value for benefiting from immunotherapy in multiple cohorts of multiple cancers, and also guided the utilization of chemotherapy drugs.",['Sun J; Guo H; Zhang S; Nie Y; Zhou S; Zeng Y; Sun Y'],2024,lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment and early tumor development. tumor immunogenic cell death-related lncRNAs are involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment. the study validated the signature for prognosis and immunotherapy benefit of lung adenocarcinoma patients.
Cognition in children with arachnoid cysts - A five-year follow-up after microneurosurgical fenestration.,"In recent years there has been a re-evaluation regarding the clinical implications of temporal lobe arachnoid cysts (temporal arachnoid cysts) in children. These cysts have often been considered asymptomatic, or if symptomatic, only causing focal neurological symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure. However, several studies have more recently reported on cognitive symptoms improving after surgery. This study aimed to evaluate if reported cognitive improvement after surgery of temporal arachnoid cysts were stable after five years. Ten consecutive children (m = 14.65; range 12.1-19.415 were assessed cognitively five years after micro-neurosurgical fenestration of a temporal arachnoid cyst. Results were compared to results from their pre- and post-surgical evaluations. Evaluations included the Wechsler-scales, Boston Naming Test (BNT), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), verbal fluency test (FAS) and Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT). The analysis revealed significant postsurgical improvement compared to baseline on the Wechsler-scales measures of general intelligence (FSIQ), verbal abilities (VCI) and processing speed (PSI). Mean differences after surgery were 8.3 for FSIQ, (p = 0.026), 8.5 for VI (p =  < .01) and 9.9 for PSI (p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in mean test results when comparing postsurgical scores with scores five years after surgery, indicating long-term stability of improvements. The results indicate that affected cognitive functions in children with temporal arachnoid cysts improve after surgery and that the improvements remain stable five years later. The improvements and long term stability were also consistent with the experience of both parents and children. The findings provide a strong argument for neurosurgical fenestration of temporal arachnoid cysts in children.",['Adolfsson T; Edström E; Tedroff K; Sandvik U'],2024,"re-evaluation of temporal lobe arachnoid cysts in children. cysts have often been considered asymptomatic, or if symptomatic, only causing focal neurological symptoms or signs of increased intracranial pressure. but several studies have more recently reported on cognitive symptoms improving after surgery."

"Real-world evaluation of an algorithmic machine-learning-guided testing approach in stable chest pain: a multinational, multicohort study.","An algorithmic strategy for anatomical vs. functional testing in suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) (Anatomical vs. Stress teSting decIsion Support Tool; ASSIST) is associated with better outcomes than random selection. However, in the real world, this decision is rarely random. We explored the agreement between a provider-driven vs. simulated algorithmic approach to cardiac testing and its association with outcomes across multinational cohorts. In two cohorts of functional vs. anatomical testing in a US hospital health system [Yale; 2013-2023; <i>n</i> = 130 196 (97.0%) vs. <i>n</i> = 4020 (3.0%), respectively], and the UK Biobank [<i>n</i> = 3320 (85.1%) vs. <i>n</i> = 581 (14.9%), respectively], we examined outcomes stratified by agreement between the real-world and ASSIST-recommended strategies. Younger age, female sex, Black race, and diabetes history were independently associated with lower odds of ASSIST-aligned testing. Over a median of 4.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 2.4-7.1) and 5.4 (IQR: 2.6-8.8) years, referral to the ASSIST-recommended strategy was associated with a lower risk of acute myocardial infarction or death (hazard ratio<sub>adjusted</sub>: 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.85, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and 0.74 [95% CI 0.60-0.90], <i>P</i> = 0.003, respectively), an effect that remained significant across years, test types, and risk profiles. In <i>post hoc</i> analyses of anatomical-first testing in the Prospective Multicentre Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, alignment with ASSIST was independently associated with a 17% and 30% higher risk of detecting CAD in any vessel or the left main artery/proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, respectively. In cohorts where historical practices largely favour functional testing, alignment with an algorithmic approach to cardiac testing defined by ASSIST was associated with a lower risk of adverse outcomes.

"Design of a bi-directional methodology for automated assessment of compliance to continuous application of clinical guidelines, and its evaluation in the type 2 diabetes domain.","We introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based-care quality assessment, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance (BiKBAC) method, and the DiscovErr system, which implements it. Our methodology compares the guideline's Asbru-based formal representation, including its intentions, with the longitudinal medical record, using a top-down and bottom-up approach. Partial matches are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. The system was evaluated in the type 2 Diabetes management domain, comparing it to three expert clinicians, including two diabetes experts. The system and the experts commented on the management of 10 patients, randomly selected from 2,000 diabetes patients. On average, each record spanned 5.23 years; the data included 1,584 medical transactions. The system provided 279 comments. The experts made 181 different unique comments. The completeness (recall) of the system was 91% when the gold standard was comments made by at least two of the three experts, and 98%, compared to comments made by all three experts. The experts also assessed all of the 114 medication-therapy-related comments, and a random 35% of the 165 tests-and-monitoring-related comments. The system's correctness (precision) was 81%, compared to comments judged as correct by both diabetes experts, and 91%, compared to comments judged as correct by one diabetes expert and at least as partially correct by the other. 89% of the comments were judged as important by both diabetes experts, 8% were judged as important by one expert, and 3% were judged as less important by both experts. Adding the validated system comments to the experts' comments, the completeness scores of the experts were 75%, 60%, and 55%; the expert correctness scores were respectively 99%, 91%, and 88%. Thus, the system could be ranked first in completeness and second in correctness.

Prevalence and clinical outcomes of germline variants among patients with myeloid neoplasms.,"Myeloid neoplasms (MNs) with germline predisposition have been recognised as a distinct entity. Emerging evidence suggests that sporadic myelodysplastic syndromes may also harbour undetected germline predispositions. We investigated germline alterations in a cohort of 122 adult Thai MNs. MN patients were recruited and tested for germline variants using deep targeted next-generation sequencing. The germline variant was filtered using American College of Medical Genetics classifications and then evaluated for the association with clinical characteristics and outcomes. Our findings revealed pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline alterations in 12 (10%) of the patients. These germline lesions were commonly found in the DNA damage response pathway (n=6, 50%). We also identified novel deleterious <i>FANCA</i> <sup>A1219GfsTer59</sup> variants in two patients diagnosed with secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (sAML) from aplastic anaemia and AML with myelodysplasia related. Among sAML, individuals with germline mutations had inferior overall survival compared with those with wild-type alleles (2 months vs 12 months) with HR 4.7 (95% CI 1.0 to 20), p=0.037. Therefore, the presence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations may be linked to inferior survival outcomes.

This underscores the importance of germline genetic testing within the Asian population.",['Kongkiatkamon S; Niparuck P; Rattanathammethee T; Kobbuaklee S; Suksusut A; Wudhikarn K; Ittiwut C; Chetruengchai W; Chuncharunee S; Bunworasate U; Suphapeetiporn K; Rojnuckarin P; Polprasert C'],2024,sporadic myelodysplastic syndromes may also harbour undetected germline predispositions. sporadic myeloid neoplasms (MNs) have been recognised as distinct entity.
Physical activity and risk of workplace and commuting injuries: a cohort study.,"Leisure-time physical activity (PA) has been hypothesized to reduce the likelihood of occupational injuries, but it is unclear whether this association varies between workplace and commuting injuries. The aim of this study was to examine the association between PA and risk of workplace and commuting injuries. Data were derived from the Finnish Public Sector study including 82 716 person-observations (48 116 participants). PA was requested repeatedly in four questionnaire surveys between 2000-2012. The average level of PA from two subsequent questionnaires was used to assess long-term PA. To obtain a 1-year incidence of injuries, participants were linked to occupational injury records from the national register. Logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations was used to examine the association between PA and injury risk. The analysis was adjusted for age, sex, education, work schedule, job demand, sleep difficulties, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and depression for workplace and commuting injuries, and workplace injuries were additionally adjusted for physical heaviness of an occupation and injury risk by occupation. Higher level of PA was associated with a lower risk of workplace injuries compared to inactive participants [odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.98].

Risk assessment of diabetes using the Indian Diabetes Risk Score among older adults: Secondary analysis from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India.,"The Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) is a simple tool to assess the probability of an individual having type 2 diabetes (T2DM) but its applicability in community-dwelling older adults is lacking. This study aimed to estimate the risk of T2DM and its determinants among older adults without prior diabetes (DM) using the IDRS, while also assessing its sensitivity and specificity in individuals with a history of diabetes. We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) wave-1 (2017-18). IDRS was calculated amongst individuals aged ≥45 years considering waist circumference, physical activity, age and family history of DM. Risk was categorized as high (≥60), moderate (30-50), and low (<30). Among 64541 individuals, 7.27 % (95 % CI: 6.78, 7.80) were at low risk, 61.80 % (95 % CI: 60.99, 62.61) at moderate risk, and 30.93 % (95 % CI: 30.19, 31.67) at high risk for T2DM. Adjusted analysis showed higher risk of T2DM among men, widowed/divorced, urban residents, minority religions, overweight, obese, and individuals with hypertension. ROC curve yielded an AUC of 0.67 (95 % CI: 0.66, 0.67, P < 0.001). The IDRS cutoff ≥50 had 73.69 % sensitivity and 51.40 % specificity for T2DM detection. More than 9 in 10 older adults in India without history of DM have high-moderate risk of T2DM when assessed with the IDRS risk-prediction tool. However, the low specificity and moderate sensitivity of IDRS in existing DM cases constraints its practical utility as a decision tool for screening.",['Basu S; Maheshwari V; Roy D; Saiyed M; Gokalani R'],2024,"the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) was calculated amongst individuals aged 45 years. risk was categorized as high (60), moderate (30-50), and low (30)."
Endodontic inflammatory disease and future cardiovascular events and mortality. A report from the PAROKRANK study.,"Prospective studies assessing the relation between endodontic inflammatory disease and subsequent cardiovascular events are few. The present aim was to explore associations between endodontic variables and future cardiovascular events in patients with myocardial infarction and matched controls participating in the PAROKRANK study. Eight-hundred and five patients hospitalized for a first myocardial infarction and 805 controls were recruited between 2010 to 2014. Signs of endodontic inflammatory disease were assessed in panoramic radiographs taken at baseline. Mortality and morbidity data during the approximately eight years of follow up were obtained from national registries. The risk for future cardiovascular events (first of mortality and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) was analyzed with the Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for the following confounders: sex, age, smoking, myocardial infarction, diabetes, education, marital status, family history of cardiovascular disease, and marginal periodontitis. In total, 285 future events were observed during the follow-up period. Unadjusted analyses revealed that ≥1 root filled tooth increased the risk of a future event. Following adjustment, the number of remaining teeth and non-root filled teeth decreased the risk of future events while higher DMFT-score increased the risk and ≥1 primary apical periodontitis decreased the risk of suffering cardiovascular events. Higher DMFT-score and decayed teeth increased the risk of all-cause mortality. Tooth loss is a strong indicator of an increased risk for future cardiovascular events. Root filled teeth seem of limited value as a risk indicator when accounting for other risk factors. The potential effect of dental interventions on future events should be assessed in future research.",['Sebring D; Buhlin K; Lund H; Norhammar A; Rydén L; Kvist T'],2024,matched controls recruited between 2010 and 2014. 1 root filled tooth increased risk of future events. 1 root filled tooth increased risk of future events.
Aqueous humor proteomics analyzed by bioinformatics and machine learning in PDR cases versus controls.,"To comprehend the complexities of pathophysiological mechanisms and molecular events that contribute to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and evaluate the diagnostic value of aqueous humor (AH) in monitoring the onset of PDR. A cohort containing 16 PDR and 10 cataract patients and another validation cohort containing 8 PDR and 4 cataract patients were studied. AH was collected and subjected to proteomics analyses. Bioinformatics analysis and a machine learning-based pipeline called inference of biomolecular combinations with minimal bias were used to explore the functional relevance, hub proteins, and biomarkers. Deep profiling of AH proteomes revealed several insights. First, the combination of SIAE, SEMA7A, GNS, and IGKV3D-15 and the combination of ATP6AP1, SPARCL1, and SERPINA7 could serve as surrogate protein biomarkers for monitoring PDR progression. Second, ALB, FN1, ACTB, SERPINA1, C3, and VTN acted as hub proteins in the profiling of AH proteomes. SERPINA1 was the protein with the highest correlation coefficient not only for BCVA but also for the duration of diabetes. Third, ""Complement and coagulation cascades"" was an important pathway for PDR development. AH proteomics provides stable and accurate biomarkers for early warning and diagnosis of PDR.

Exploring new mechanisms of Imeglimin in diabetes treatment: Amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction.,"With the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it has become critical to identify effective treatment strategies. In recent years, the novel oral hypoglycaemic drug Imeglimin has attracted much attention in the field of diabetes treatment. The mechanisms of its therapeutic action are complex and are not yet fully understood by current research. Current evidence suggests that pancreatic β-cells, liver, and skeletal muscle are the main organs in which Imeglimin lowers blood glucose levels and that it acts mainly by targeting mitochondrial function, thereby inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhancing insulin sensitivity, promoting pancreatic β-cell function, and regulating energy metabolism. There is growing evidence that the drug also has a potentially volatile role in the treatment of diabetic complications, including metabolic cardiomyopathy, diabetic vasculopathy, and diabetic neuroinflammation. According to available clinical studies, its efficacy and safety profile are more evident than other hypoglycaemic agents, and it has synergistic effects when combined with other antidiabetic drugs, and also has potential in the treatment of T2DM-related complications. This review aims to shed light on the latest research progress in the treatment of T2DM with Imeglimin, thereby providing clinicians and researchers with the latest insights into Imeglimin as a viable option for the treatment of T2DM.",['Li Y; Lou N; Liu X; Zhuang X; Chen S'],2024,the novel oral hypoglycaemic drug Imeglimin has attracted much attention in the field of diabetes treatment. the mechanism of its therapeutic action is complex and are not yet understood by current research.
"Beyond blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis - Role of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system in the interplay between metabolic diseases and breast cancer.","The classical renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), as well as the recently described counter-regulatory or non-canonical RAAS have been well characterized for their role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Moreover, extensive research has been conducted over the past decades on both paracrine and the endocrine roles of local RAAS in various metabolic regulations and in chronic diseases. Clinical evidence from patients on RAAS blockers as well as pre-clinical studies using rodent models of genetic manipulations of RAAS genes documented that this system may play important roles in the interplay between metabolic diseases and cancer, namely breast cancer. Some of these studies suggest potential therapeutic applications and repurposing of RAAS inhibitors for these diseases. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms by which RAAS is involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type-2 diabetes as well as the role of this system in the initiation, expansion and/or progression of breast cancer, especially in the context of metabolic diseases.",['Kalupahana NS; Moustaid-Moussa N'],2024,renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) has been well characterized for their role in cardiovascular homeostasis. extensive research has been conducted over the past decades on both paracrine and the endocrine roles of local RAAS in various metabolic regulations and in chronic diseases.
A Novel Nomogram to Predict Prognosis in Elderly Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients After Ablation Therapy.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant form of primary liver cancer. Early diagnosis is crucial for improving prognosis. Elderly HCC patients often have underlying liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, leading to impaired liver function and suboptimal liver reserve. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has rapidly become one of the most important methods for treating early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (EHCC) due to its advantages, including minimal trauma, short operation time, less intraoperative bleeding, quick postoperative recovery, cost-effectiveness, and few postoperative-complications. However, the prognostic model for early recurrence after local ablation in elderly EHCC patients has not been widely evaluated. We have developed a prognostic model for the recurrence of local RFA in elderly EHCC patients. This is expected to provide a new early warning system for preventing early recurrence in elderly EHCC patients, prolonging patient's life, and improving overall quality of life. In this study, we included 661 EHCC patients who underwent local ablation, dividing them into a Primary cohort and a Validation cohort in a 7:3 ratio. We characterized the cohorts and utilized the primary cohort to develop a prognostic nomogram model for recurrence after local ablation in elderly EHCC patients. Additionally, the validation cohort was used to assess the potential of the nomogram as a non-invasive biomarker for post-ablation recurrence in EHCC. The user-friendly nomogram incorporates common clinical variables including gender, BCLC stage, tumor number, tumor size, red blood cell (RBC), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and prothrombin time activity (PTA). The nomogram constructed using the identified seven variables exhibits robust discriminatory capabilities, favorable predictive performance, and noteworthy clinical utility. We developed a user-friendly nomogram based on the BCLC stage classification, which may provide prognostic assessments for elderly EHCC patients at 1, 3, and 5 years post-RFA.",['Tang X; Wang Q; Jin R; Hu C'],2024,early diagnosis is crucial for improving prognosis. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant form of primary liver cancer. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the predominant form of primary liver cancer.
For the Long Haul: Management of Long-Term Survivors after Melanoma Systemic Therapy.,"This review summarizes the latest advancements in survivorship care for patients with advanced melanoma who received systemic therapy and emphasizes the areas where more research is needed. Over the last decade there have been remarkable advances in the treatment of advanced and metastatic melanoma. Due to these novel treatments, including several immune checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, there are and will continue to be increasing numbers of long-term melanoma survivors who have been treated with systemic therapy. These patients will navigate new challenges are they are essentially among the first long term survivors after these novel therapies. Survivorship care focuses on improving the health-related quality of life of patients including the physical, emotional, social and functional effects of cancer that begin at diagnosis and continue through the end of life. Survivorship also includes screening for cancer recurrence and second cancers. As the number of melanoma survivors who received systemic therapy continues to grow, the survivorship care plan will become increasingly important for optimal care of patients even after their cancer treatments.

Towards Integrated Care for the Elderly: Exploring the Acceptability of Telemonitoring for Hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Management.,"Telemonitoring has been proposed as an effective method to support integrated care for older people with hypertension and type 2 diabetes. This paper examines acceptability of telemontioring, its role in supporting integrated care, and identifies scale-up barriers. A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods study, including in-depth interviews (n = 29) and quantitative acceptability tool (n = 55) was conducted among individuals who underwent a 12-month telemonitoring routine. The research was guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Interviews were analysed using template content analysis (TCA). TCA identified seven domains of acceptability, with twenty-one subthemes influencing it positively or negatively. In the quantitative survey, acceptability was high across all seven domains with an overall score of 4.4 out of 5. Urban regions showed higher acceptability than rural regions (4.5 vs. 4.3), with rural participants perceiving initial training and participation effort as significantly more burdensome than their urban counterparts. Patients described several instances where telemonitoring supported self-management, education, treatment, and identification elements of the integrated care package. However, there were barriers that may limit its further scale-up. For further scale-up, it is important to screen patients for monitoring eligibility, adapt telemonitoring devices to elderly needs, combine telemonitoring with health education, involve family members, and establish follow-up programmes.",['Mihevc M; Lukančič MM; Črt Z; Potočnik TV; Šter MP; Klemenc-Ketiš Z; Susič AP'],2024,telemonitoring is an effective method to support integrated care for older people. it is proposed as an effective method to support integrated care for older people. telemontioring is a multi-disciplinary approach to telemontioring.
"Trends in oesophageal cancer mortality in Montenegro, 1990-2018.","Oesophageal cancer (OC) is a significant public health issue, despite the decreasing trends in OC mortality rates observed globally in the past decades. The objective of our study is to analyze the pattern of OC mortality in Montenegro between 1990 and 2018 and contribute to the development of a national long-term strategy for the prevention and control of this malignancy. The data on OC death cases in Montenegro between 1990 and 2018 were collected. The mortality rates were standardized according to the World Standard Population. The Joinpoint, Linear and Poisson regressions were applied to analyze the OC mortality trend. Joinpoint regression analysis showed an increase in death rates for men and the overall level which were not statistically significant. However, the number of cases increases significantly with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) increase of 2.6% for the overall level [AAPC (95% CI)=2.6 (1.0-4.2); P = 0.002] at the expense of the increase in men, which on average was 2.6% annually [AAPC (95%CI) = 2.6 (1.2-4.1); P = 0.001]. The age groups 55-64 and 65-74 have the highest percentage of deaths cases from OC with 30.6% and 31.4%, respectively. Montenegro has witnessed a recent increase in the number of deaths from OC, although the mortality rates remain stable. National strategies to further reduce mortality rates for OC are necessary.

Evaluation of oyster mushroom (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>)-derived anthraquinone on the induction of apoptosis and suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in breast cancer cells.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Breast cancer results from tissue degradation caused by environmental and genetic factors that affect cells in the body. Matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-2 and MMP-9, are considered potential putative markers for tumor diagnosis in clinical validation due to their easy detection in body fluids. In addition, recent reports have suggested multiple roles for MMPs, rather than simply degeneration of the extracellular matrix, which comprises mobilizing growth factors and processing surface molecules. <b>Methods</b>: In this study, the chemotherapeutic effects of anthraquinone (AQ) extracted from edible mushrooms (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> Jacq. ex Fr.) cells was examined in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The cytotoxic potential and oxidative stress induced by purified anthraquinone were assessed in MCF-7 cells using MTT and ROS estimation assays. Gelatin Zymography, and DNA fragmentation assays were performed to examine <i>MMP</i> expression and apoptotic induction in the MCF-7 cells treated with AQ. The genes crucial for mutations were examined, and the mutated RNA knockout plausibility was analyzed using the CRISPR spcas9 genome editing software. <b>Results</b>: MCF-7 cells were attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by the administration of AQ purified from <i>P. ostreatus</i> compared with the standard anticancer drug paclitaxel. AQ supplementation decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairment in MCF-7 cells. Treatment with AQ and AQ with paclitaxel consistently decreased the expression of crucial marker genes such as <i>MMP2</i> and <i>MMP9</i>. The mutated genes <i>MMP2</i>, <i>MMP7</i>, and <i>MMP9</i> were assessed and observed to reveal four putative gene knockdown potentials for breast cancer treatment. <b>Conclusions</b>: The synergistic application of AQ and paclitaxel exerted a strong inhibitory effect on the MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Extensive studies are imperative to better understand the action of bioactive mixes on the edible oyster fungus <i>P. ostreatus</i>. The gene knockout potential detected by CRISPR SpCas9 will aid in elite research into anticancer treatments.",['Jayaprakash B; Suresh AR; Thiruvengadam R; Alharbi NS; Kadaikunnan S; Sankaran S; Thiruvengadam M; Senthil R; Venkidasamy B'],2024,chemotherapeutic effects of anthraquinone (AQ) extracted from edible mushrooms were examined in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. cytotoxic potential and oxidative stress induced by purified anthraquinone were assessed in MCF-7 cells using MTT and ROS estimation assays.
Associations of marrow fat fraction with MR imaging based trabecular bone microarchitecture in first-time diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"To determine whether there are alterations in marrow fat content in individuals first-time diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and to explore the associations between marrow fat fraction and MRI-based findings in trabecular bone microarchitecture. A case-control study was conducted, involving adults with first-time diagnosed T1DM (n=35) and age- and sex-matched healthy adults (n=46). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and 3 Tesla-MRI of the proximal tibia were performed to assess trabecular microarchitecture and vertebral marrow fat fraction. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to test the associations of marrow fat fraction with trabecular microarchitecture and bone density while adjusting for potential confounding factors. In individuals first-time diagnosed with T1DM, the marrow fat fraction was significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to healthy controls. T1DM patients also exhibited higher trabecular separation [median (IQR): 2.19 (1.70, 2.68) vs 1.81 (1.62, 2.10), <i>p</i> < 0.001], lower trabecular volume [0.45 (0.30, 0.56) vs 0.53 (0.38, 0.60), <i>p</i> = 0.013], and lower trabecular number [0.37 (0.26, 0.44) vs 0.41 (0.32, 0.47), <i>p</i> = 0.020] compared to controls. However, bone density was similar between the two groups (<i>p</i> = 0.815). In individuals with T1DM, there was an inverse association between marrow fat fraction and trabecular volume (<i>r</i> = -0.69, <i>p</i> < 0.001) as well as trabecular number (<i>r</i> = -0.55, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and a positive association with trabecular separation (<i>r</i> = 0.75, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Marrow fat fraction was independently associated with total trabecular volume (standardized β = -0.21), trabecular number (β = -0.12), and trabecular separation (β = 0.57) of the proximal tibia after adjusting for various factors including age, gender, body mass index, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, blood glucose, plasma glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile, and bone turnover biomarkers.

Analyzing Immune Cell Infiltration and Copper Metabolism in Diabetic Foot Ulcers.,"Diabetes impairs wound healing, notably in diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Stress, marked by the accumulation of lipoylated mitochondrial enzymes and the depletion of Fe-S cluster proteins, triggers cuproptosis-a distinct form of cell death. The involvement of copper in the pathophysiology of DFU has been recognized, and currently, a copper-based therapeutic strategy is emerging as a viable option for enhancing ulcer healing. This study investigates genes linked to copper metabolism in DFU, aiming to uncover potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Two diabetic wound Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were analyzed to study immune cell dysregulation in diabetic wounds. Differentially expressed genes related to copper metabolism were identified and analyzed using machine learning methods. Gene ontology, pathway enrichment, and immune infiltration analyses were performed using DFU samples. The expression of identified genes was validated using qRT-PCR and single-cell RNA sequencing. Ten genes associated with copper metabolism were identified. Among these, SLC31A1 and ADNP were found to be significantly differentially expressed in DFU. Notably, SLC31A1 exhibited higher expression in macrophages, whereas ADNP was found to be highly expressed in fibroblasts and chondrocytes. The study indicates a close link between copper metabolism, the infiltration of immune cells, and DFU. It proposes that copper metabolism could influence the progression of DFU through the activation of immune responses. These observations offer fresh perspectives on the underlying mechanisms of DFU and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",['Yi WJ; Yuan Y; Bao Q; Zhao Z; Ding HS; Song J'],2024,copper metabolism is a key therapeutic strategy for enhancing ulcer healing. the study aims to uncover potential targets for therapeutic intervention. the study suggests a close link between copper metabolism and the infiltration of immune cells.

The impact of hearing aids on cognitive function and quality of life in patients with hearing impairment: A cross-sectional study.,"Age-related cognitive decline involves a complex set of factors. Among these factors, hearing loss is considered to have a significant impact, but the effect of hearing aid use remains unresolved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of hearing aid use by simultaneously assessing various factors not only cognitive function but also frailty, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with hearing loss. The cross-sectional study at the Hearing Aid (HA) Center was conducted between 2020 and 2021. Initially, associations with cognitive function, QOL, frailty, and mental state among patients with hearing loss were examined, irrespective of whether they wore a hearing aid or not. Next, these patients were divided into HA users (using HA for more than 1 year) and non-users (no prior use of HA) with 42 patients in each group. The average age and 6-frequency pure tone audiometry (PTA) was 74.5 ± 6.5 years and 50.6 ± 12.1 dB, respectively. All participants filled out the questionnaire about their life style, medical condition. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive function, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale for mental state, Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2) for QOL, and Kihon Checklist for frailty were compared between HA users and non-users and correlated with the auditory data (PTA and speech discrimination). Among 84 patients, 40 had an MMSE score ≦26. All eight scores and three components of SF-36v2 were lower than those of the control group. The patients with hypertension were significantly more in HA user than in non-HA user, whereas there was no difference in diabetes, heart attack, stroke and education. Although HA users were older and showed hypertension more their PTA was worse than that of non-users, MMSE scores were not different between the groups. MMSE scores correlated with both PTA and speech discrimination in non-users but not in HA users. However, a multivariate analysis of the effect of HA use on MMSE scores adjusting for age, hypertension, and hearing loss, could not be revealed. The vitality and mental component summary of the SF-36v2 was better in HA users than in non-users. Elderly patients with hearing loss were cognitively impaired and had low QOL. HA users showed better QOL score than non-HA user, especially about the mental condition. The absence of a correlation between MMSE scores and hearing loss in HA users suggests the potential use of HA in preventing cognitive decline.",['Morita Y; Yagi C; Wada T; Fujisaki T; Ohtaki H; Kitazawa M; Yamagishi T; Ohshima S; Izumi S; Oi Y; Ito S; Horii A'],2024,"study was conducted between 2020 and 2021. association with cognitive function, QOL, frailty, and mental state among patients with hearing loss."
Awareness of HPV vaccine and its socio-demographic determinants among the parents of eligible daughters in Bangladesh: A nationwide study.,"Vaccination against Human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to avoid HPV infections and its associated diseases, including cervical cancer. However, there is no awareness study among Bangladeshi population. Hence, this nationwide study was conducted to explore HPV vaccine awareness and its determinants among parents of eligible adolescent girls. This study was conducted among the parents of daughters aged 9-15 years from 42 out of 64 randomly selected districts of Bangladesh between June 28 to August 2, 2023. A multistage sampling method was used to enroll 2151 study participants from all eight divisions of Bangladesh. A semi-structured questionnaire was used for face-to-face interviews in this study. The statistical software Stata (Version 17) was used for statistical analyses. The average age of the participants was 38.18 (±5.86) years. Only 22.32 % of the participants were aware of the HPV vaccine. Every additional year of age increased the likelihood of being aware of the HPV vaccine by 3 % (AOR: 1.03; 95%CI: 1.00-1.06). Participants residing in the urban area had 3.56 times higher odds of awareness than rural and semi-urban people. Businessmen and housewives had 60 % (AOR: 0.40; 95 % CI: 0.22-0.69) and 77 % (AOR: 0.23; 95 % CI: 0.16-0.33) lower odds in comparison to job holders. The lower-income group exhibited significantly higher odds of awareness (AOR: 0.25, 95%CI: 0.16-0.39) compared to the middle and the higher-income group. Participants who never went through routine health check-ups had 77 % lower odds of being aware than those who availed of regular routine check-ups (AOR: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.16-0.34). Awareness of the HPV vaccine among the general population of Bangladesh is very low. Age, residence, occupation, monthly income, and routine medical check-ups were associated with HPV vaccine awareness. A nationwide awareness campaign would increase this awareness level among the Bangladeshi population, especially among the parents of daughters.",['Eva FN; Khan MAS; Islam T; Monisha UK; Meem NE; Hossain MA; Goutam A; Zerin T; Alam N; Nath R; Sifat S; Sultana S; Sultana MS; Saha SK; Sarker NE; Rahman ML; Nabi MH; Hawlader MDH'],2024,"Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to avoid HPV infections and its associated diseases, including cervical cancer. there is no awareness study among Bangladeshi population."
Drug screening on digital microfluidics for cancer precision medicine.,"Drug screening based on in-vitro primary tumor cell culture has demonstrated potential in personalized cancer diagnosis. However, the limited number of tumor cells, especially from patients with early stage cancer, has hindered the widespread application of this technique. Hence, we developed a digital microfluidic system for drug screening using primary tumor cells and established a working protocol for precision medicine. Smart control logic was developed to increase the throughput of the system and decrease its footprint to parallelly screen three drugs on a 4 × 4 cm<sup>2</sup> chip in a device measuring 23 × 16 × 3.5 cm<sup>3</sup>. We validated this method in an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft mouse model and liver cancer specimens from patients, demonstrating tumor suppression in mice/patients treated with drugs that were screened to be effective on individual primary tumor cells.

"Association Between Vitamin B12 Intake and Mortality in Patients with Colorectal Cancer: The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2018.","Vitamin B12 plays a role in DNA methylation, influencing the 1-carbon cycle; However, its effect on colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality remains uncertain. This study assessed the relationship between vitamin B12 intake and all-cause and cancer-specific mortality among CRC patients. We analyzed data from the NHANES from 1999 to 2018, using multivariable Cox regression, competing risk model, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and stratified analysis with interaction effects. The studied involved 4,554 cancer patients (mean age 65.8 years, 47.6% males). Results from multivariate Cox regression indicated that each additional 1 mcg/day of dietary vitamin B12 independently increased the risk of all-cause (HR, 1.07; 95% CI: 1.04-1.09, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a higher risk of all-cause mortality with increased vitamin B12 intake (Log rank <i>p</i> = 0.01). Subgroup analysis suggested that higher vitamin B12 intake correlated with increased all-cause mortality risk, especially in individuals with higher protein (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02-1.06; <i>p</i> = 0.019) or carbohydrate intake (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.05; <i>p</i> = 0.04). Thus, higher vitamin B12 intake correlates with increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality in CRC patients, particularly those with higher protein or carbohydrate intake.",['Zhou Y; Wang Q; Yin T; Zhao D; Zhou G; Sun X; Tan C; Zhou L; Yao S'],2024,"vitamin B12 intake correlated with increased all-cause mortality risk. 4,554 cancer patients were treated with vitamin B12."
Feedback loop between hypoxia and energy metabolic reprogramming aggravates the radioresistance of cancer cells.,"Radiotherapy is one of the mainstream approaches for cancer treatment, although the clinical outcomes are limited due to the radioresistance of tumor cells. Hypoxia and metabolic reprogramming are the hallmarks of tumor initiation and progression and are closely linked to radioresistance. Inside a tumor, the rate of angiogenesis lags behind cell proliferation, and the underdevelopment and abnormal functions of blood vessels in some loci result in oxygen deficiency in cancer cells, i.e., hypoxia. This prevents radiation from effectively eliminating the hypoxic cancer cells. Cancer cells switch to glycolysis as the main source of energy, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, to sustain their rapid proliferation rates. Therefore, pathways involved in metabolic reprogramming and hypoxia-induced radioresistance are promising intervention targets for cancer treatment. In this review, we discussed the mechanisms and pathways underlying radioresistance due to hypoxia and metabolic reprogramming in detail, including DNA repair, role of cancer stem cells, oxidative stress relief, autophagy regulation, angiogenesis and immune escape. In addition, we proposed the existence of a feedback loop between energy metabolic reprogramming and hypoxia, which is associated with the development and exacerbation of radioresistance in tumors. Simultaneous blockade of this feedback loop and other tumor-specific targets can be an effective approach to overcome radioresistance of cancer cells. This comprehensive overview provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying tumor radiosensitivity and progression.",['Shi Z; Hu C; Zheng X; Sun C; Li Q'],2024,hypoxia and metabolic reprogramming are hallmarks of tumor initiation and progression. hypoxia and metabolic reprogramming are closely linked to radioresistance. hypoxia and hypoxia are associated with the development and exacerbation of radioresistance in tumors.
Role of follow-up gallium scintigraphy in the evaluation of malignant external otitis (skull base osteomyelitis): A case report.,"Malignant otitis externa (skull base osteomyelitis) can be fatal and long-term antibiotic therapy is recommended. Despite being potentially fatal, this infection causes minor changes in inflammatory biomarkers (white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels) upon blood testing. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging changes persist over a long period. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the optimal time for the discontinuation of antibiotics. We present a 77-year-old male whose medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus who suffered from chronic otitis media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. His condition did not improve with proper treatment, and imaging revealed malignant otitis media. Intravenous cefepime treatment was administered. Antibiotic treatment was de-escalated to oral levofloxacin treatment after Gallium-67 scintigraphy showed less accumulation after 6 weeks of Cefepime administration; accumulation almost disappeared after 1 year.

[Computer-vision-based artificial intelligence for detection and recognition of instruments and organs during radical laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer: a multicenter study].,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the feasibility and accuracy of computer vision-based artificial intelligence technology in detecting and recognizing instruments and organs in the scenario of radical laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Eight complete laparoscopic distal radical gastrectomy surgery videos were collected from four large tertiary hospitals in China (First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital [three cases], Liaoning Cancer Hospital [two cases], Liyang Branch of Jiangsu Province People's Hospital [two cases], and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center [one case]). PR software was used to extract frames every 5-10 seconds and convert them into image frames. To ensure quality, deduplication was performed manually to remove obvious duplication and blurred image frames. After conversion and deduplication, there were 3369 frame images with a resolution of 1,920×1,080 PPI. LabelMe was used for instance segmentation of the images into the following 23 categories: veins, arteries, sutures, needle holders, ultrasonic knives, suction devices, bleeding, colon, forceps, gallbladder, small gauze, Hem-o-lok, Hem-o-lok appliers, electrocautery hooks, small intestine, hepatogastric ligaments, liver, omentum, pancreas, spleen, surgical staplers, stomach, and trocars. The frame images were randomly allocated to training and validation sets in a 9:1 ratio. The YOLOv8 deep learning framework was used for model training and validation. Precision, recall, average precision (AP), and mean average precision (mAP) were used to evaluate detection and recognition accuracy. <b>Results:</b> The training set contained 3032 frame images comprising 30 895 instance segmentation counts across 23 categories. The validation set contained 337 frame images comprising 3407 instance segmentation counts. The YOLOv8m model was used for training. The loss curve of the training set showed a smooth gradual decrease in loss value as the number of iteration calculations increased. In the training set, the AP values of all 23 categories were above 0.90, with a mAP of 0.99, whereas in the validation set, the mAP of the 23 categories was 0.82. As to individual categories, the AP values for ultrasonic knives, needle holders, forceps, gallbladders, small pieces of gauze, and surgical staplers were 0.96, 0.94, 0.91, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.91, respectively. The model successfully inferred and applied to a 5-minutes video segment of laparoscopic gastroenterostomy suturing. <b>Conclusion:</b> The primary finding of this multicenter study is that computer vision can efficiently, accurately, and in real-time detect organs and instruments in various scenarios of radical laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.",['Zhang KC; Qiao Z; Yang L; Zhang T; Liu FL; Sun DC; Xie TY; Guo L; Lu CR'],2024,eight complete laparoscopic distal radical gastrectomy surgery videos were collected from four large tertiary hospitals in china. the video was collected from four large tertiary hospitals in china.
"Discovery of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, a novel olfactory receptor 2AT4 agonist that regulates proliferation and apoptosis in leukemia cells.","Olfactory receptors (ORs), the largest family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are ectopically expressed in cancer cells and are involved in cellular physiological processes, but their function as anticancer targets is still potential. OR2AT4 is expressed in leukemia cells, influencing the proliferation and apoptosis, yet the limited number of known OR2AT4 agonists makes it challenging to fully generalize the receptor's function. In this study, we aimed to identify new ligands for OR2AT4 and to investigate their functions and mechanisms in K562 leukemia cells. After producing the recombinant OR2AT4 protein, immobilizing it on a surface plasmon resonance chip, and conducting screening to confirm binding activity using 258 chemicals, five novel OR2AT4 ligands were discovered. As a result of examining changes in intracellular calcium by five ligands in OR2AT4-expressing cells and K562 cells, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was identified as an OR2AT4 agonist in both cells. EGCG reduced the viability of K562 cells and induced apoptosis in K562 cells. EGCG increased the expression of cleaved caspase 3/8 and had no effect on the expression of Bax and Bcl-2, indicating that it induced apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway. Additionally, the initiation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in EGCG-induced K562 cells was due to the activation of OR2AT4, using an OR2AT4 antagonist. This study highlights the potential of EGCG as an anti-cancer agent against leukemia and OR2AT4 as a target, making it a new anti-cancer drug.",['Choi YR; Na HJ; Lee JA; Kim Y; Kim YS; Kim MJ'],2024,ligands for OR2AT4 are ectopically expressed in cancer cells. the limited number of known agonists makes it challenging to generalize the receptor's function.

Dose-response relationship between physical activity and the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease among individuals with diabetes: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,"Diabetes, a chronic condition affecting various organs, is frequently associated with abnormal lipid metabolism, notably increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These lipid abnormalities are closely linked to the development and advancement of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although regular physical activity (PA) has consistently shown benefits in reducing CVD risk in the general population, its precise influence on CVD risk among diabetic patients remains uncertain, particularly regarding dose-response relationships. This study aimed to summarize the evidence from prospective studies on the association between PA and CVD morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes, and to explore the optimal levels for public health recommendation. We systematically reviewed prospective cohort studies in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to December 2022, with inclusion criteria specifying the studies published in English and included adult participants diagnosed with diabetes. A random-effects model was used to pool the relative risk (RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing the highest with the lowest PA categories in each study for qualitative evaluation. In addition, linear and spline regression analyses were used to estimate dose-response associations. The meta-analysis included 12 prospective cohort studies, involving a total of 109,820 participants with diabetes. The combined results revealed that higher levels of PA were associated with a reduced risk of CVD. The RR of CVD for the highest compared with the lowest PA category was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.51-0.73). In addition, there were four studies describing leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and the pooled RR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52-0.83) for the highest versus the lowest activity. The linear regression model revealed that each 10 MET-h/week of incrementally higher PA was associated with a 19.0% (95% CI, 11.6%-25.7%) and a 6.9% (95% CI, 4.5%-9.3%) reduction in CVD morbidity and mortality. Additionally, spline regression curves showed nonlinear relationships between PA levels and the risk of CVD and CVD mortality (both P-nonlinearity <0.001), with a limited reduction in CVD risk and some further reduction in CVD mortality above 20 MET-h per week of PA levels. For patients with diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, there was a dose-response relationship between increased PA and reduced risk of CVD morbidity and mortality. The observed PA threshold is consistent with the recommended level for the general population. Gradually moving from inactivity to a guideline-recommended PA level could therefore significantly reduce the burden of CVD in patients with diabetes.",['Chen Y; Jin X; Chen G; Wang R; Tian H'],2024,"diabetes is a chronic condition affecting various organs. it is often associated with abnormal lipid metabolism, notably increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels. this is a condition that affects the general population."
Major surgical conditions of childhood and their lifelong implications: comprehensive review.,"In recent decades, the survival of children with congenital anomalies and paediatric cancer has improved dramatically such that there has been a steady shift towards understanding their lifelong health outcomes. Paediatric surgeons will actively manage such conditions in childhood and adolescence, however, adult surgeons must later care for these 'grown-ups' in adulthood. This article aims to highlight some of those rare disorders encountered by paediatric surgeons requiring long-term follow-up, their management in childhood and their survivorship impact, in order that the adult specialist may be better equipped with skills and knowledge to manage these patients into adulthood. A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify relevant publications. Research studies, review articles and guidelines were sought, focusing on the paediatric management and long-term outcomes of surgical conditions of childhood. The article has been written for adult surgeon readership. This article describes the aforementioned conditions, their management in childhood and their lifelong implications, including: oesophageal atresia, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, malrotation, short bowel syndrome, duodenal atresia, gastroschisis, exomphalos, choledochal malformations, biliary atresia, Hirschsprung disease, anorectal malformations, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital lung lesions and paediatric cancer. The increasing survivorship of children affected by surgical conditions will translate into a growing population of adults with lifelong conditions and specialist healthcare needs.

It is hoped that this timely review will enthuse the readership to offer care for such vulnerable patients, and to collaborate with paediatric surgeons in providing successful and seamless transitional care.",['Cullis PS; Fouad D; Goldstein AM; Wong KKY; Boonthai A; Lobos P; Pakarinen MP; Losty PD'],2024,paediatric surgeons will actively manage such conditions in childhood and adolescence. adult surgeons must later care for these 'grown-ups' in adulthood. a comprehensive literature review was performed to identify relevant publications.
Cardiac-specific PFKFB3 overexpression prevents diabetic cardiomyopathy via enhancing OPA1 stabilization mediated by K6-linked ubiquitination.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a prevalent complication of type 2 diabetes (T2D). 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) is a glycolysis regulator. However, the potential effects of PFKFB3 in the DCM remain unclear. In comparison to db/m mice, PFKFB3 levels decreased in the hearts of db/db mice. Cardiac-specific PFKFB3 overexpression inhibited myocardial oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, suppressed mitochondrial fragmentation, and partly restored mitochondrial function in db/db mice. Moreover, PFKFB3 overexpression stimulated glycolysis. Interestingly, based on the inhibition of glycolysis, PFKFB3 overexpression still suppressed oxidative stress and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in vitro, which indicated that PFKFB3 overexpression could alleviate DCM independent of glycolysis. Using mass spectrometry combined with co-immunoprecipitation, we identified optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) interacting with PFKFB3. In db/db mice, the knockdown of OPA1 receded the effects of PFKFB3 overexpression in alleviating cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Mechanistically, PFKFB3 stabilized OPA1 expression by promoting E3 ligase NEDD4L-mediated atypical K6-linked polyubiquitination and thus prevented the degradation of OPA1 by the proteasomal pathway. Our study indicates that PFKFB3/OPA1 could be potential therapeutic targets for DCM.",['Luo J; Hu S; Liu J; Shi L; Luo L; Li W; Cai Y; Tang J; Liu S; Fu M; Dong R; Yang Y; Tu L; Xu X'],2024,db/db mice showed PFKFB3 levels decreased in the hearts of db/db mice.

Preliminary Exploration of Potential Active Ingredients and Molecular Mechanisms of Yanggan Yishui Granules for Treating Hypertensive Nephropathy Using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS Coupled with Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Strategy.,"Hypertensive nephropathy (HN) is a prevalent complication of hypertension and stands as the second primary reason for end-stage renal disease. Research in clinical settings has revealed that Yanggan Yishui Granule (YGYSG) has significant therapeutic effects on HN. However, the material basis and action mechanisms of YGYSG against HN remain unclear. Consequently, this study utilized a comprehensive method integrating ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), network pharmacology, and molecular docking to delineate the active ingredients and potential therapeutic mechanisms of YGYSG for treating HN. Firstly, sixty distinct components were recognized in total as potential active ingredients in YGYSG by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Subsequently, the mechanisms of YGYSG against HN were revealed for the first time using network pharmacology. 23 ingredients played key roles in the complete network and were the key active ingredients, which could affect the renin-angiotensin system, fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis, HIF-1 signaling pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications by regulating 29 key targets such as TNF, IL6, ALB, EGFR, ACE, and MMP2. YGYSG could treat HN through the suppression of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, attenuating the proliferation of renal vascular smooth muscle cells, lessening glomerular capillary systolic pressure, and ameliorating renal dysfunction and vascular damage through the aforementioned targets and pathways. Molecular docking results revealed that most key active ingredients exhibited a high affinity for binding to the key targets. This study pioneers in clarifying the bioactive compounds and molecular mechanisms of YGYSG against HN and offers scientific reference into the clinical application.",['Yang F; Zhang K; Dai X; Jiang W'],2024,YGYSG could treat HN through the suppression of inflammatory response and oxidative stress. yGYSG could treat HN through the suppression of inflammatory response and oxidative stress.
PPA1 promotes adipogenesis by regulating the stability of C/EBPs.,"Adipogenesis significantly contributes to healthy adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Increasing adipocyte number or function to alleviate adipose tissue overload could serve as a therapeutic strategy for both lipodystrophy and obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPA1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) and is involved in many biochemical reactions, but its function in adipose tissue has not been studied previously. In this study, we demonstrated that adipose-specific PPA1 knockout (PPA1<sup>AKO</sup>) mice showed lipodystrophy and spontaneously developed hepatic steatosis and severe insulin resistance under normal chow diet feeding. PPA1 deficiency suppressed the differentiation of primary adipocyte precursors and 3T3-L1 cells. Notably, PPA1 overexpression can restore inhibited adipogenesis in preadipocytes isolated from db/db mice and type 2 diabetes patients. Mechanistic studies have revealed that PPA1 acts as a positive regulator of early adipocyte differentiation by promoting CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinβ and δ (C/EBPβ and δ) protein stability. Moreover, the function of PPA1 in adipogenesis is independent of its PPi catalytic activity. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings demonstrated that PPA1 is a novel critical upstream regulator of adipogenesis, controlling adipose tissue development and whole-body metabolic homeostasis.",['Wu Y; Sun Y; Song Y; Wang J; Han Y; Yang N; Lin H; Yin Y; Han X'],2024,adipogenesis can help alleviate adipose tissue overload. adipogenesis is independent of its PPi catalytic activity.

Prenatal Exposure to Chemical Mixtures and Metabolic Syndrome Risk in Children.,"Prenatal exposure to ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children, but few studies have studied chemical mixtures or explored underlying protein and metabolic signatures. To investigate associations of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures with MetS risk score in children and identify associated proteins and metabolites. This population-based, birth cohort study used data collected between April 1, 2003, and February 26, 2016, from the Human Early Life Exposome cohort based in France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK. Eligible participants included mother-child pairs with measured prenatal EDC exposures and complete data on childhood MetS risk factors, proteins, and metabolites. Data were analyzed between October 2022 and July 2023. Nine metals, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 5 polychlorinated biphenyls, 2 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 5 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 10 phthalate metabolites, 3 phenols, 4 parabens, and 4 organophosphate pesticide metabolites measured in urine and blood samples collected during pregnancy. At 6 to 11 years of age, a composite MetS risk score was constructed using z scores of waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin levels. Childhood levels of 44 urinary metabolites, 177 serum metabolites, and 35 plasma proteins were quantified using targeted methods. Associations were assessed using bayesian weighted quantile sum regressions applied to mixtures for each chemical group. The study included 1134 mothers (mean [SD] age at birth, 30.7 [4.9] years) and their children (mean [SD] age, 7.8 [1.5] years; 617 male children [54.4%] and 517 female children [45.6%]; mean [SD] MetS risk score, -0.1 [2.3]). MetS score increased per 1-quartile increase of the mixture for metals (β = 0.44; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.30 to 0.59), organochlorine pesticides (β = 0.22; 95% CrI, 0.15 to 0.29), PBDEs (β = 0.17; 95% CrI, 0.06 to 0.27), and PFAS (β = 0.19; 95% CrI, 0.14 to 0.24). High-molecular weight phthalate mixtures (β = -0.07; 95% CrI, -0.10 to -0.04) and low-molecular weight phthalate mixtures (β = -0.13; 95% CrI, -0.18 to -0.08) were associated with a decreased MetS score. Most EDC mixtures were associated with elevated proinflammatory proteins, amino acids, and altered glycerophospholipids, which in turn were associated with increased MetS score. This cohort study suggests that prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures may be associated with adverse metabolic health in children. Given the pervasive nature of EDCs and the increase in MetS, these findings hold substantial public health implications.",['Güil-Oumrait N; Stratakis N; Maitre L; Anguita-Ruiz A; Urquiza J; Fabbri L; Basagaña X; Heude B; Haug LS; Sakhi AK; Iszatt N; Keun HC; Wright J; Chatzi L; Vafeiadi M; Bustamante M; Grazuleviciene R; Andrušaityte S; Slama R; McEachan R; Casas M; Vrijheid M'],2024,"prenatal exposure to ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemicals may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children. a population-based study used data collected between April 1, 2003 and February 26, 2016. participants included mother-child pairs with measured prenatal exposures."
Impact of Duration of Diabetes Mellitus on Long-term Outcome in Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention After the First Myocardial Infarction.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The impact of the diabetes duration on the long-term outcome of those with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after the first AMI is unclear. In this study, we evaluated the predictive value of diabetes duration in the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). A total of 394 type 2 DM patients with PCI after the first AMI were enrolled and were divided into two groups by the diabetes duration. A short-DM group with diabetes duration of < 5 years and a long-DM group with a duration of ≥ 5 years. The clinical endpoint was MACCEs. Multivariate Cox regression analysis found that the diabetes duration was independently associated with increased occurrence of MACCEs [HR 1.512, 95% CI: (1.033, 2.215), p = 0.034], along with hypertension, Killip class III or IV, creatinine, multivessel disease, and continuous hypoglycemic therapy. After adjusting for the confounding variables, a nested Cox model showed that diabetes duration was still an independent risk factor of MACCEs [HR 1.963, 95% CI: (1.376, 2.801), p < 0.001]. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve illustrated a significantly high risk of MACCEs (HR 2.045, p < 0.0001) in long-duration DM patients. After propensity score matching, a longer diabetes duration was associated with an increased risk of MACCE occurrence.

Extended Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for Giant Pediatric Craniopharyngiomas: Technical Note and Case Series.,"Giant pediatric craniopharyngiomas are rare tumors whose clinical and surgical management is extremely challenging. A variety of open transcranial approaches has been used to resect these lesions. Although there has been an increasing acceptance of the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) for the resection of pediatric craniopharyngiomas in recent years, many surgeons continue to recommend against the use of the EEA for giant pediatric craniopharyngiomas. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of extended EEA for giant craniopharyngiomas in the pediatric population. All consecutive pediatric patients with giant craniopharyngiomas (diameter >4 cm) who underwent endoscopic endonasal surgery at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Data on demographic information, preoperative assessment, imaging features, surgical results, complications, and recurrences were recorded and analyzed. A total of 16 pediatric patients with an average age of 12 years were identified. The mean maximum diameter and volume of the tumors were 4.35 cm and 24.1 cm3, respectively. Gross total resection was achieved in 13 patients (81.3%) and subtotal resection in 3 patients (18.7%). Postoperatively, partial or complete anterior pituitary insufficiency occurred in 100% of patients, and 62.5% developed new-onset diabetes insipidus. Visual function improved in 9 patients (56.3%) and remained stable in 7 patients (43.7%). Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 2 patients and was successfully repaired through the EEA. During a mean follow-up of 44.3 months, 18.8% of patients had a >9% increase in body mass index, and 93.8% of patients successfully returned to school or work. Two patients (12.5%) suffered a recurrence. Disease control was achieved in 16 patients (100%) at final follow-up.

Serum bile acid and unsaturated fatty acid profiles of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetic patients.,"The understanding of bile acid (BA) and unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) profiles, as well as their dysregulation, remains elusive in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) coexisting with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Investigating these metabolites could offer valuable insights into the pathophy-siology of NAFLD in T2DM. To identify potential metabolite biomarkers capable of distinguishing between NAFLD and T2DM. A training model was developed involving 399 participants, comprising 113 healthy controls (HCs), 134 individuals with T2DM without NAFLD, and 152 individuals with T2DM and NAFLD. External validation encompassed 172 participants. NAFLD patients were divided based on liver fibrosis scores. The analytical approach employed univariate testing, orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and decision curve analysis to pinpoint and assess the diagnostic value of serum biomarkers. Compared to HCs, both T2DM and NAFLD groups exhibited diminished levels of specific BAs. In UFAs, particular acids exhibited a positive correlation with NAFLD risk in T2DM, while the ω-6:ω-3 UFA ratio demonstrated a negative correlation. Levels of α-linolenic acid and γ-linolenic acid were linked to significant liver fibrosis in NAFLD. The validation cohort substantiated the predictive efficacy of these biomarkers for assessing NAFLD risk in T2DM patients. This study underscores the connection between altered BA and UFA profiles and the presence of NAFLD in individuals with T2DM, proposing their potential as biomarkers in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.",['Feng SS; Wang SJ; Guo L; Ma PP; Ye XL; Pan ML; Hang B; Mao JH; Snijders AM; Lu YB; Ding DF'],2024,bile acid (BA) and unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) profiles remain elusive in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus coexisting with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). a training model was developed involving 399 participants.
Increased risk of bladder cancer recurrence due to bacillus Calmette-Guérin shortage in Brazil.,"Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of bacillus Calmette-Guérin shortage on recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in a Brazilian cohort. We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathological data of 409 patients who had their first transurethral resection of the bladder tumor for intermediate or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer between June 2014 and May 2021 in a tertiary public hospital in Brazil. Patients included had non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder resected completely for the first time, regardless of bacillus Calmette-Guérin use. Low-risk disease patients were excluded from the analysis. Demographic, clinicopathological, and bacillus Calmette-Guérin use data were collected from our database. Recurrence and progression data were obtained from patient records or through telephone interviews. Recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival were calculated from the date of transurethral resection of the bladder tumor until the events of recurrence, progression, last office visit, or phone interview. Within a median follow-up period of 26.7 months, 168 (41.1%) patients experienced a recurrence in a median time of 27 months (95%CI 16.1-38). Bacillus Calmette-Guérin was administered to 57 (13.9%) individuals after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. Patients with ≥3 lesions (p<0.001), those with lesions >3 cm (p=0.02), and those without bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment (p<0.001) had shorter recurrence-free survival. According to a Cox multivariate regression model, bacillus Calmette-Guérin use was independently associated with a reduced recurrence rate, with an HR of 0.43 (95%CI 0.25-0.72). Out of the patients studied, 26 (6.4%) experienced progression. T1 stage (p<0.001) and high-grade (p<0.001) were associated with shorter progression-free survival. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin did not influence bladder cancer progression. In the Cox multivariate analysis, high-risk disease was independently associated with progression (p<0.001). Our study confirms that non-muscle invasive bladder cancer exhibits a high recurrence rate. The use of adjuvant bacillus Calmette-Guérin in intermediate and high-risk patients significantly reduces this rate. Furthermore, the bacillus Calmette-Guérin shortage could have negatively impacted these patients.",['Murta CB; Hayek KKRE; Dias BC; Yorioka MAW; Cassao VD; Claro JFA'],2024,bacillus Calmette-Guérin shortage recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. 168 (41.1%) patients experienced a recurrence in a median follow-up period of 27 months.
"Establishing and Monitoring an Effective Management of Benign Nontoxic Multinodular Goitre in Kuwait ""Utilizing Two Different Dose Levels of Recombinant Human TSH in Combination with Radioactive Iodine"".","rhTSH-assisted radioiodine therapy of multinodular goiter is not fully known and only a few studies, with a limited number of patients have evaluated the effect of rhTSH assisted radioiodine therapy beyond 1 year. Though there is an effective and safe management of benign non-toxic MNG available, it is not applicable to all patient categories in Kuwait covering the impact of the past environmental events (Gulf War) and the genetic relation. The proposed project aims to address those points raised, that is exclusive to the Kuwait population. In this cohort study, 2 groups of patients, group one (G1) and group two (G2) patients (N=50, ≥18 years old) went undergo evaluated according to a proposed criteria followed by FNA to exclude cancer, toxicity and those who have refused surgery. All patients had a CT scan, TSH, T3, T4 and CBC and complete biomedical tests at a 6-months interval during the treatment period and the follow up. The Volumetric application of GE 670 SPECT/CT (i.e. Xeleris) and in-house developed MATLAB used for quantitative measurement. All patients had a 131-I uptake at baseline and 24 intervals post intramuscular a single dose of 0.3mg or 0.1mg (group 1, group 2) of rhTSH. There was no significant difference in TSH levels at 24-month follow-up between the two groups (p=0.327), whereas there was a statistically significant difference at the baseline and at the 6-months interval between the 2 groups for T4. Post treatment follow up at the 24-hour time point, Group 1 displayed significantly higher uptake than Group 2 (G1:41.74 ± 6.27 vs. G2:34.80 ± 3.84, p < 0.001). The change in I131 uptake from baseline to 24 hours was significantly greater in Group 1compared to Group 2 (p < 0.001). The ROC analysis (AUC) post treatment indicated an excellent discriminatory power for AUC (0.960) and (p < 0.001). There was a much better correlation posttreatment between BMI and thyroid volume for group 1 (R2=0.661) than for group 2 (R2=0.008). Our results suggest 42.1% thyroid volume reduction for group 1 and 20% for group 2.

Cardiovascular and renal outcomes of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists among patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.,"Multiple cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) have shown the efficacy of GLP-1RAs in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) for high-risk patients. However, some CVOTs failed to demonstrate cardiovascular benefits. We analyzed the impact of GLP-1RA on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with or without T2DM, with subgroup analysis based on sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body mass index (BMI), and history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A comprehensive database search for placebo-controlled RCTs on GLP-1RA treatment was conducted until April 2024. Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out, employing a robust statistical analysis using a random effects model to determine outcomes with log odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 13 CVOTs comprising 83,258 patients were included. GLP-1RAs significantly reduced MACE (OR 0.86, 95 % CI: 0.80 to 0.94, <i>p</i> < 0.01) all-cause mortality OR 0.87, 95 % CI: 0.82 to 0.93, <i>p</i> < 0.001, CV mortality (OR 0.87, 95 % CI: 0.81 to 0.94, <i>p</i> < 0.001), stroke (fatal: OR 0.74, 95 % CI: 0.56 to 0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.03; non-fatal: OR 0.87, 95 % CI: 0.79 to 0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.005), coronary revascularization (OR 0.86, 95 % CI: 0.74 to 0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.023), and composite kidney outcome (OR 0.76, 95 % CI: 0.67 to 0.85, <i>p</i> < 0.001.

SIRT1/AMPK-mediated pathway: Ferulic acid from sugar beet pulp mitigating obesity-induced diabetes-linked complications and improving metabolic health.,"Obesity-induced type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of metabolic syndrome due to the high calorie intake. The role of sugar beet pulp (SBP) in T2D and the mechanism of its action remain unclear, though it is abundant in phenolics and has antioxidant activity. In this study, we isolated and purified ferulic acid from SBP, referred to as SBP-E, and studied the underlying molecular mechanisms in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism developing high glucose/high fat diet-induced diabetic models in vitro and in vivo. SBP-E showed no cytotoxicity and reduced the oxidative stress by increasing glutathione (GSH) in human liver (HepG2) and rat skeletal muscle (L6) cells. It also decreased body weight gain, food intake, fasting blood glucose levels (FBGL), glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and lipid accumulation. Additionally, SBP-E decreased the oxidative stress and improved the antioxidant enzyme levels in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced T2D mice. Further, SBP-E reduced plasma and liver advanced glycation end products (AGEs), malondialdehyde (MDA), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in HFD-fed mice. Importantly, SBP-E significantly elevated AMPK, glucose transporter, SIRT1 activity, and Nrf2 expression and decreased ACC expression and SREBP1 levels in diabetic models. Collectively, our study results suggest that SBP-E treatment can improve obesity-induced T2D by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism via SIRT1/AMPK signalling and the AMPK/SREBP1/ACC1 pathway.",['Singh SSB; Patil KN'],2024,ferulic acid is abundant in phenolics and has antioxidant activity. ferulic acid is abundant in phenolics and has antioxidant activity.
Cannabidiol and Aza-BODIPY Coencapsulation for Photodynamic Therapy Enhancement in Liver Cancer Cells.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been explored for their potential in synergistic cancer treatment. In this study, we employed CBD oil as a lipid phase, encapsulated within <b>AZB-I@Lec-T</b> to create lipid-based nanoparticles. Here, CBD oil does two tasks: it acts as a pyroptosis agent to destroy liver cancer cells and as a lipid phase to dissolve the photosensitizer. It was expected that this system would offer synergistic therapy between CBD and PDT better than a single use of each treatment. With a series of <i>in vitro</i> experiments, the nanoparticles exhibited induced apoptosis in 68% of HepG2 cells treated with <b>AZB-I@Lec-T@CBD</b> and near-infrared (NIR)-light irradiation, reducing expression levels of antioxidant defense system genes. Furthermore, both components worked well in a submicromolar range when combined in our formulation. These results highlight the potential for amplifying primary cellular damage with the combination of PDT and CBD encapsulation, providing a promising therapeutic approach for liver cancer treatment guidelines.",['Kampaengsri S; Muangsopa P; Pangjantuk A; Chansaenpak K; Lai RY; Noisa P; Kamkaew A'],2024,photodynamic therapy (PDT) and cannabidiol (CBD) have been explored for their potential in synergistic cancer treatment. the nanoparticles exhibited induced apoptosis in 68% of HepG2 cells treated with b>AZB-I@Lec-T@CBD/b> and near-infrared (NIR)-light irradiation.
Fibronectin-Targeting Dual-Modal MR/NIRF Imaging Contrast Agents for Diagnosis of Gastric Cancer and Peritoneal Metastasis.,"The prevalence and fatality rates of gastric cancer (GC) remain elevated, with advanced stages presenting a grim prognosis. Noninvasive diagnosis of GC cancer often proves challenging until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage or metastasized. Initially, the level of fibronectin (FN) in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of GC was at least 3.7 times higher than that in normal fibroblasts. Herein, two FN-targeting magnetic resonance/near-infrared fluorescence (MR/NIRF) imaging contrast agents were developed to detect GC and peritoneal metastasis noninvasively. The probes CREKA-Cy7-(Gd-DOTA) and CREKA-Cy7-(Gd-DOTA)<sub>3</sub> demonstrated significant FN-targeting capability (with dissociation constants of 1.0 and 2.1 mM) and effective MR imaging performance (with proton relaxivity values of 9.66 and 27.44 mM<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 9.4 T, 37 °C). In vivo imaging revealed a high signal-to-noise ratio and successful visualization of GC metastasis using NIRF imaging as well as successful tumor detection in MR imaging. Therefore, this study highlights the potential of FN-targeting probes for GC diagnosis and aids in the advancement of new diagnostic strategies for the clinical detection of GC.",['Yang N; Huang Y; Wang X; Wang D; Yao D; Ren G'],2024,FN-targeting probes were developed to detect GC and peritoneal metastasis.

Evaluation of the Effectiveness of In-Hospital Exercise Rehabilitation in Middle-Aged and Elderly Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Combined with Sarcopenia Effect of Lifestyle Management on Disease Status in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"The aim of this study was to explore the effects of in-hospital exercise rehabilitation on glucose and lipid metabolism and healthy physical fitness in middle-aged and elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) combined with sarcopenia, and to provide a reference for the effective implementation of exercise rehabilitation for middle-aged and elderly patients with T2DM combined with sarcopenia in healthcare institutions. This study retrospectively included 122 patients with T2DM combined with sarcopenia treated at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from August 2017 to August 2020 and randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group. The control group was given conventional treatment and the experimental group was given exercise rehabilitation in the hospital for 12 weeks to compare the indexes related to glucose and lipid metabolism and healthy fitness in the two groups. After the intervention, the experimental group showed significant decreases in fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) and body fat percentage (<i>p</i> < 0.05), while high-density cholesterol (HDL-C), grip strength, lower limb extension, lower limb flexion, peak oxygen uptake were significantly higher (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and were more significant at 12 weeks compared to the 6-week intervention (<i>p</i> < 0.05). However, there were no significant changes in any of the glucose metabolism indicators in the control group before and after the intervention. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that at control baseline levels, HbA1c decreased significantly in the experimental group after both 6 and 12 weeks of intervention compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). After 6 weeks of intervention, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in body fat percentage and a significant increase in grip strength. After 12 weeks of intervention, the experimental group showed an increase in glycemic control from 33.3% to 73.3%, a significant decrease in body fat percentage and a significant increase in grip strength, lower limb extension and lower limb flexion strength and peak oxygen uptake.

Case report: Increased efficacy of cetuximab after pembrolizumab failure in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.,"Immunotherapy is the first-line option for treating advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). However, up to half of patients experience no benefit and treatment resistance, warranting newer therapeutic approaches. Combinatory approaches, including cetuximab, may help overcome immunotherapy resistance and improve response rates in advanced cSCC. We report three cases of metastatic cSCC that achieved significant clinical responses after cetuximab therapy following initial progression on pembrolizumab. We have retrospectively reviewed these cases at a single academic center between 2018 and 2023. All patients initially progressed on pembrolizumab, after which cetuximab (mono- or combination therapy) was added with two complete responses and one partial response. Initial responses were noted within 2 to 7 months of starting cetuximab.

Reperfusion therapies in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and atrial fibrillation: data on safety and effectiveness from a multi-centre cohort study.,"Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or endovascular therapy (EVT) are currently considered best practices in acute stroke patients. Data regarding the efficacy and safety of reperfusion therapies in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are conflicting as regards haemorrhagic transformation, mortality, and functional outcome. This study sought to investigate for any differences, in terms of safety and effectiveness, between AF patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) treated and untreated with reperfusion therapies. Data from two multicenter cohort studies (RAF and RAF-NOACs) on consecutive patients with AF and AIS were analyzed to compare patients treated and not treated with reperfusion therapies (IVT and/or EVT). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors for outcome events: 90-day good functional outcome and mortality. A propensity score matching (PSM) analysis compared treated and untreated patients. Overall, 441 (25.4%) were included in the reperfusion-treated group and 1,295 (74.6%) in the untreated group. The multivariable model suggested that reperfusion therapies were significantly associated with good functional outcome. Rates of mortality and disability were higher in patients not treated, especially in the case of higher NIHSS scores. In the PSM comparison, 173/250 patients (69.2%) who had received reperfusion therapies had good functional outcome at 90 days, compared to 146/250 (58.4%) untreated patients (p = 0.009, OR: 1.60, 95% CI:1.11-2.31). Patients with AF and AIS treated with reperfusion therapies had a significantly higher rate of good functional outcome and lower rates of mortality compared to those patients with AF and AIS who had undergone conservative treatment.","[""Cancelloni V; Buratti M; Tsivgoulis G; Furie KL; Tadi P; Caso V; Becattini C; Agnelli G; Zedde M; Abdul-Rahim AH; Alberti A; Venti M; de Magistris IL; Acciarresi M; D'Amore C; Mosconi MG; Cimini LA; Cappellari M; Putaala J; Tomppo L; Tatlisumak T; Bandini F; Marcheselli S; Pezzini A; Sohn SI; Lorenzini G; Tassi R; Guideri F; Acampa M; Ntaios G; Karagkiozi E; Athanasakis G; Makaritsis K; Sagris D; Adamou A; Vadikolias K; Palaiodimou L; Chondrogianni M; Mumoli N; Galati F; Sacco S; Tiseo C; Corea F; Ageno W; Bellesini M; Silvestrelli G; Ciccone A; Mancuso M; Orlandi G; Pascarella R; Tassinari T; Rueckert C; Baldi A; Toni D; Lettieri F; Giuntini M; Lotti EM; Flomin Y; Pieroni A; Kargiotis O; Karapanayiotides T; Halvatsiotis P; Monaco S; Baronello MM; Csiba L; Szabò L; Chiti A; Giorli E; Del Sette M; Imberti D; Zabzuni D; Doronin B; Volodina V; Michel P; Vanacker P; Barlinn K; Pallesen LP; Kepplinger J; Deleu D; Gourbali V; Yaghi S; Paciaroni M""]",2024,a multicenter cohort study compared patients treated with reperfusion therapies. a propensity score matching analysis compared treated and untreated patients. a multivariable model suggested that reperfusion therapies were significantly associated with good functional outcome.
Gut microbiota microbial metabolites in diabetic nephropathy patients: far to go.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the main complications of diabetes and a major cause of end-stage renal disease, which has a severe impact on the quality of life of patients. Strict control of blood sugar and blood pressure, including the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, can delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy but cannot prevent it from eventually developing into end-stage renal disease. In recent years, many studies have shown a close relationship between gut microbiota imbalance and the occurrence and development of DN. This review discusses the latest research findings on the correlation between gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in DN, including the manifestations of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in DN patients, the application of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in the diagnosis of DN, their role in disease progression, and so on, to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in the occurrence and prevention of DN and provide a theoretical basis and methods for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",['Yu JX; Chen X; Zang SG; Chen X; Wu YY; Wu LP; Xuan SH'],2024,nephropathy is one of the main complications of diabetes. it can delay the progression of diabetes but cannot prevent it from developing into end-stage renal disease. many studies have shown a close relationship between gut microbiota imbalance and the occurrence and development of DN.

DNA methylation and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review.,"DNA methylation influences gene expression and function in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Mapping of T2DM-associated DNA methylation could aid early detection and/or therapeutic treatment options for diabetics. A systematic literature search for associations between T2DM and DNA methylation was performed. Prospero registration ID: CRD42020140436. PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were searched (till October 19, 2023). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and New Castle Ottawa scale were used for reporting the selection and quality of the studies, respectively. Thirty-two articles were selected. Four of 130 differentially methylated genes in blood, adipose, liver or pancreatic islets (TXNIP, ABCG1, PPARGC1A, PTPRN2) were reported in > 1 study. TXNIP was hypomethylated in diabetic blood across ethnicities. Gene enrichment analysis of the differentially methylated genes highlighted relevant disease pathways (T2DM, type 1 diabetes and adipocytokine signaling). Three prospective studies reported association of methylation in IGFBP2, MSI2, FTO, TXNIP, SREBF1, PHOSPHO1, SOCS3 and ABCG1 in blood at baseline with incident T2DM/hyperglycemia. Sex-specific differential methylation was reported only for HOOK2 in visceral adipose tissue (female diabetics: hypermethylated, male diabetics: hypomethylated). Gene expression was inversely associated with methylation status in 8 studies, in genes including ABCG1 (blood), S100A4 (adipose tissue), PER2 (pancreatic islets), PDGFA (liver) and PPARGC1A (skeletal muscle).

Urinary biochemical and histopathological examination in C57BL/6 and db/db mice of DKD and HKC groups was done. Single-cell RNA sequencing pipeline was then performed. The regulatory mechanisms of seven flavonoids in HKC were revealed by cell communication, prediction of transcription factor regulatory network, and molecular docking. By constructing ligand-receptor regulatory network and performing molecular docking between 75 receptors with different activities and seven flavonoids. 11 key receptors in 4 cell types (segment 3 proximal convoluted tubular cell, ascending limbs of the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and T cell) in kidneys were found to be directly interacted with HKC. The interactions regulated 8 downstream regulons. The docking receptors in T cell led to transcriptional event differences in the regulons such as Cebpb, Rel, Tbx21 and Klf2 and consequently affected the activation, differentiation, and infiltration of T cell, while the receptors Tgfbr1 and Ldlr in stromal cells of kidneys were closely associated with the downstream transcriptional events of renal injury and proteinuria in DKD. The current study provides novel information of the key receptors and regulons in renal cells for a better understanding of the cell type specific molecular mechanisms of A. manihot in treatment of DKD.",['Wu C; Tang H; Cui X; Li N; Fei J; Ge H; Wu L; Wu J; Gu HF'],2024,"HKC is an ethanol extract of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) the bioactive ingredients of HKC include flavonoids such as rutin, hyperoside, hibifolin, isoquercetin, myricetin, quercetin and quercetin-3-O-robinobioside. the regulatory mechanisms of seven flavonoids in HKC were revealed by cell communication, prediction of transcription factor regulatory network, and molecular docking."
Neuropeptide Modulation of Bidirectional Internetwork Synapses.,"Oscillatory networks underlying rhythmic motor behaviors, and sensory and complex neural processing, are flexible, even in their neuronal composition. Neuromodulatory inputs enable neurons to switch participation between networks, or participate in multiple networks simultaneously. Neuromodulation of internetwork synapses can both recruit and coordinate a switching neuron in a second network. We previously identified an example in which a neuron is recruited into dual-network activity via peptidergic modulation of intrinsic properties. We now ask whether the same neuropeptide also modulates internetwork synapses for internetwork coordination. The crab (<i>Cancer borealis</i>) stomatogastric nervous system contains two well-defined feeding-related networks (pyloric, food filtering, ~1 Hz; gastric mill, food chewing, ~0.1 Hz). The projection neuron MCN5 uses the neuropeptide Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide to recruit the pyloric-only LPG neuron into dual pyloric plus gastric mill-timed bursting via modulation of LPG's intrinsic properties. Descending input is not required for a coordinated rhythm, thus intra-network synapses between LPG and its second network must underlie coordination among these neurons. However, synapses between LPG and gastric mill neurons have not been documented. Using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, we found that graded synaptic currents between LPG and gastric mill neurons (LG, IC, DG) were primarily negligible in saline, but were enhanced by Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide. Further, LPG and gastric mill neurons entrain each other during Gly<sup>1</sup>-SIFamide application, indicating bidirectional, functional connectivity. Thus, a neuropeptide mediates neuronal switching through parallel actions, modulating intrinsic properties for recruitment into a second network and as shown here, also modulating bidirectional internetwork synapses for coordination.",['Fahoum SH; Blitz DM'],2024,neuromodulatory inputs enable neurons to switch participation between networks. neuropeptidergic modulation of intrinsic properties can recruit and coordinate a switching neuron in a second network. the same neuropeptide also modulates internetwork synapses for internetwork coordination.
Pneumocystis pneumonia in French intensive care units in 2013-2019: mortality and immunocompromised conditions.,"The recent epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and the associated spectrum of immunocompromising conditions are poorly described. We analyzed all adult PCP cases admitted to French ICUs via the French medical database system (PMSI), over the period from 2013 to 2019. French ICUs admitted a total of 4055 adult patients with PCP. Among all hospitalized PCP cases, the proportion requiring ICU admission increased from 17.8 in 2014 to 21.3% in 2019 (P < 0.001). The incidence of severe PCP rose from 0.85 in 2013 to 1.32/100,000 adult inhabitants in 2019 (P < 0.0001), primarily due to the proportion of HIV-negative patients that increased from 60.6% to 74.4% (P < 0.0001). Meanwhile, the annual number of severe PCP cases among patients with HIV infection remained stable over the years. In-hospital mortality of severe PCP cases was 28.5% in patients with HIV infection and 49.7% in patients without. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that patients with HIV infection had a lower adjusted risk of death than patients without HIV infection (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95% confidence interval [95CI]: 0.17-0.55). Comorbidities or conditions strongly associated with hospital mortality included the patient's age, Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II, congestive heart failure, coagulopathy, solid organ cancer, and cirrhosis. A vast array of autoimmune inflammatory diseases affected 19.9% of HIV-negative patients. The number of PCP cases requiring ICU admission in France has risen sharply. While the yearly count of severe PCP cases in HIV-infected patients has remained steady, this rise predominantly affects cancer patients, with a recent surge observed in patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases, affecting one in five individuals.",['Kamel T; Boulain T'],2024,"the proportion of PCP cases admitted to french ICUs increased from 17.8 in 2014 to 21.3% in 2019 (P  0.001). the incidence of severe PCP rose from 0.85 in 2013 to 1.32/100,000 adult inhabitants in 2019 (P  0.0001)."
"Balance performance, falls-efficacy and social participation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without vestibular dysfunction.","The performance of balance is an important factor to perform activities. The complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially vestibular dysfunction (VD), could decrease balance performance and falls-efficacy (FE) which consequently impacts social participation and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to compare balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL between individuals with T2DM with and without VD. The participants comprised 161 T2DM with VD and 161 without VD. Three clinical tests used for confirming VD included the Head Impulse Test (HIT), the Dix Hallpike Test (DHT) and the Supine Roll Test (SRT). The scores of static and dynamic balances, FE, social participation and QoL were compared between groups. The balance performance, FE, social participation and QoL were lower in the group with VD. The number of patients who had severe social restriction was higher in T2DM with VD than without VD (58.4% <i>vs</i> 48.4%). Moreover, all domains of QoL (physical, psychological, social relationships and environmental) were lower in T2DM with VD than without VD. The presence of VD in T2DM patients was associated with decreased physical balance performances and increased social and QoL disengagement. Comprehensive management related to balance and FE, as well as the monitoring to support social participation and QoL, should be emphasized in patients with T2DM with VD.",['Komalasari DR; Vongsirinavarat M; Hiengkaew V; Nualnim N'],2024,the complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could decrease balance performance and falls-efficacy (FE) which consequently impacts social participation and quality of life (QoL)
Comparative histological analysis of spleens in pediatric patients with hemolytic anemias: Insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of spleen destruction in sickle cell anemia.,"While sickle cell anemia (SCA) and hereditary spherocytosis (HS) share common features of increased spleen erythrophagocytosis due to increased red blood cell (RBC) turnover, SCA is specifically characterized by susceptibility to infections. In this study, histological lesions in the spleens of pediatric patients with SCA were analyzed, in close correlation with past clinical history and comparatively to HS, healthy and transfused β-thalassemia patients (TDT). An evaluation of red pulp elementary lesions (red pulp fibrosis, iron deposition, number of Gandy-Gamna, and RBC trapping) combined into a severity score was established, as well as B-cell follicles analysis. Quantification on digitalized slides of iron deposition, RBC trapping, and red pulp fibrosis was additionally performed. Spleens from 22 children with SCA, eight with HS, eight with TDT, and three healthy controls (HC) were analyzed. Median age at splenectomy was not different between SCA and HS patients, 6.05 years (range: 4.5-16.0) versus 4.75 (range: 2.2-9.5). Marked heterogeneity was found in SCA spleens in contrast to other conditions. Contrary to previous reports, B-cell follicles were generally preserved in SCA. While RBC trapping was significantly increased in both SCA and HS (compared to TDT and HC), quantitative fibrosis and overall red pulp severity score were significantly increased in SCA spleens compared to other conditions. Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between quantitative fibrosis and number of B-cell follicles, linking these two compartments as well as spleen fibrosis to infectious susceptibility in SCA, potentially through impaired red pulp macrophage scavenging and B-cell subpopulations defects.",['Brousse V; El Hoss S; Isnard P; Laurance S; Lambert C; Ali L; Bonnard A; Capito C; Sarnacki S; Berrebi D; Koehl B; Benkerrou M; Missud F; Holvoet L; Ithier G; de Montalembert M; Allali S; Tshilolo L; Diebold J; Molina TJ'],2024,"spleens of 22 children with SCA, eight with HS, eight with TDT, and three healthy controls were analyzed. spleens of spleens were analyzed in close correlation with past clinical history."
A risk predictive model for determining the severity of coronary artery lesions in older postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease.,"To determine the risk factors affecting the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in older postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (CHD) and to construct a personalized risk predictive model. In this cohort study, clinical records of 527 female patients aged ≥60 with CHD who were hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China from March 2018 to February 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The severity of CAD was determined using the Gensini scores that are based on coronary angiography findings. Patients with Gensini scores ≥40 and <40 were divided into high-risk (n=277) and non-high-risk groups (n=250), respectively. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess independent predictors of CAD severity. The nomogram prediction model of CAD severity was plotted by the R software. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curves were used to evaluate the predictive efficiency of the nomogram model, and the decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the clinical applicability of the nomogram model. Multivariate analysis showed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, RBC count, WBC count, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were independent risk factors associated with CAD severity in older menopausal women (P<0.05); the area under the ROC curve of the nomogram constructed based on the independent risk factors was 0.846 (95% CI: 0.756-0.937). The area under the ROC curve after internal validation of the nomogram by the Bootstrap method after resampling 1000 times was 0.840 (95% CI: 0.741-0.923). The calibration curve suggested that the nomogram had an excellent predictive agreement, and the DCA curve indicated that the net benefit of applying the nomogram was significantly higher than that of the ""no intervention"" and ""all intervention"" methods when the risk probability of patients with high-risk CAD severity was 0.30-0.81. A personalized risk assessment model was constructed based on the risk factors of severe CAD in older menopausal women with CHD, which had good prediction efficiency based on discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability evaluation indicators. This model could assist cardiology medical staff in screening older menopausal women with CHD who are at a high risk of severe CAD to implement targeted interventions.",['Wen W; Ye Q; Zhang LX; Ma LK'],2024,clinical records of 527 female patients aged 60 with CHD were analyzed retrospectively. the severity of CAD was determined using the Gensini scores. patients with Gensini scores 40 and 40 were divided into high-risk groups.
Glycemic Control in Patients After Initiation of Treatment for Vision-Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To understand changes in glycemic control in patients being managed with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR). <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective cohort study was performed of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at least 18 years old. Patients who started treatment for vision-threatening DR were matched with controls based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, duration of diabetes, history of diabetes, and history of hypertension. The primary outcome was the difference in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) change after 12 months between cases and controls. <b>Results:</b> Four hundred fifty patients were included (225 cases paired with 225 controls); 58.7% of patients were men, and 33.8% were Hispanic. The mean (±SD) baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> was 8.12% ± 1.57%. Patients receiving retinal interventions did not experience a significant change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> compared with controls 12 months after starting treatment (0.11% ± 1.51% vs -0.02% ± 1.52%; <i>P</i> = .31). In addition, there was not a significant difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> change between cases and controls when considering the number of interventions: 2 or fewer interventions (+0.08% ± 1.30% vs -0.07% ± 1.15%; <i>P</i> = .46), 3 to 6 interventions (+0.41% ± 1.71% vs +0.01% ± 2.0%; <i>P</i> = .08), and 7 or more interventions (-0.17% ± 1.49% vs 0.0% ± 1.31%; <i>P</i> = .50). <b>Conclusions:</b> Patients who received treatment for vision-threatening DR did not experience a change in HbA<sub>1c</sub>.

Microbes for lung cancer detection: feasibility and limitations.,"As the second most common cancer in the world, the development of lung cancer is closely related to factors such as heredity, environmental exposure, and lung microenvironment, etc. Early screening and diagnosis of lung cancer can be helpful for the treatment of patients. Currently, CT screening and histopathologic biopsy are widely used in the clinical detection of lung cancer, but they have many disadvantages such as false positives and invasive operations. Microbes are another genome of the human body, which has recently been shown to be closely related to chronic inflammatory, metabolic processes in the host. At the same time, they are important players in cancer development, progression, treatment, and prognosis. The use of microbes for cancer therapy has been extensively studied, however, the diagnostic role of microbes is still unclear. This review aims to summarize recent research on using microbes for lung cancer detection and present the current shortcomings of microbes in collection and detection. Finally, it also looks ahead to the clinical benefits that may accrue to patients in the future about screening and early detection.",['Zhou S; Zhu W; Guo H; Nie Y; Sun J; Liu P; Zeng Y'],2024,"early screening and diagnosis of lung cancer can be helpful for patients.

Constructing immune and prognostic features associated with ADCP in hepatocellular carcinoma and pan-cancer based on scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq.,"Despite the significant therapeutic outcomes achieved in systemic treatments for liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), it is an objective reality that only a low proportion of patients exhibit an improved objective response rate (ORR) to current immunotherapies. Antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) immunotherapy is considered the new engine for precision immunotherapy. Based on this, we aim to develop an ADCP-based LIHC risk stratification system and screen for relevant targets. Utilizing a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data, we screened for ADCP modulating factors in LIHC and identified differentially expressed genes along with their involved functional pathways. A risk scoring model was established by identifying ADCP-related genes with prognostic value through LASSO Cox regression analysis. The risk scoring model was then subjected to evaluations of immune infiltration and immunotherapy relevance, with pan-cancer analysis and <i>in vitro</i> experimental studies conducted on key targets. Building on the research by Kamber RA et al., we identified GYPA, CLDN18, and IRX5 as potential key target genes regulating ADCP in LIHC. These genes demonstrated significant correlations with immune infiltration cells, such as M1-type macrophages, and the effectiveness of immunotherapy in LIHC, as well as a close association with clinical pathological staging and patient prognosis. Pan-cancer analysis revealed that CLDN18 was prognostically and immunologically relevant across multiple types of cancer. Validation through tissue and cell samples confirmed that GYPA and CLDN18 were upregulated in liver cancer tissues and cells. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i> knockdown of CLDN18 inhibited the malignancy capabilities of liver cancer cells. We have identified an ADCP signature in LIHC comprising three genes. Analysis based on a risk scoring model derived from these three genes, coupled with subsequent experimental validation, confirmed the pivotal role of M1-type macrophages in ADCP within LIHC, establishing CLDN18 as a critical ADCP regulatory target in LIHC.",['Zhang Z; Li Y; Quan Z; Li Y; Zhu L; Sun S; Chen X'],2024,a low proportion of patients exhibit an improved objective response rate. a risk scoring model was established by identifying ADCP-related genes with prognostic value. the risk scoring model was then subjected to evaluations of immune infiltration and immunotherapy relevance.
Utility of hydroxychloroquine laboratory monitoring in dermatologic and rheumatologic patients.,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an immunomodulator used in dermatology and rheumatology. Side effects may be observed on routine monitoring studies before they become clinically apparent. The goal of this retrospective chart review was to assess laboratory abnormalities in dermatologic and rheumatologic patients taking HCQ. Medical records of patients prescribed HCQ were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, reported side effects, and parameters on baseline and follow-up complete blood count (CBC) and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) were recorded and graded. Laboratory abnormalities were considered severe if they were grade 3 or greater according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 and persistent if they continued beyond subsequent laboratory testing. Of 646 eligible charts, 289 had monitoring studies for review. There were 35 severe (grade 3 or 4, 35/289; 12%) adverse events that developed, as noted on CBC or CMP. Of these 35 severe adverse events, 25 self-corrected on subsequent testing, and 10 (10/289, 3%) across 9 patients were persistent, including glomerular filtration rate, alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, hemoglobin and lymphopenia abnormalities. Of these 10 abnormalities, 7/10 (70%) were unlikely due to hydroxychloroquine use according to the calculated Naranjo score for each patient. Severe laboratory abnormalities while taking hydroxychloroquine are rare, even in a population with a high rate of comorbidities. Among the abnormalities observed, the majority of them (70%) were likely due to disease progression or a medication other than hydroxychloroquine. CBC and CMP monitoring for the reason of observing abnormalities while on HCQ should be at the discretion of the prescribing physician.",['Green M; Williams L; Boh E; Kuraitis D'],2024,HCQ is an immunomodulator used in dermatology and rheumatology. side effects may be observed on routine monitoring studies.
Severe dawn phenomenon predicts long-term risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"The dawn phenomenon (DP) is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which can be more easily and precisely assessed with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). This prospective study aimed to explore the association between DP and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 5542 adult inpatients with type 2 diabetes in a single centre were analysed. The magnitude of DP (ΔG) was defined as the increment in the CGM-determined glucose value from nocturnal nadir (after 24:00) to prebreakfast. Participants were stratified into four groups by ΔG: ≤1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the impact of DP on all-cause mortality risk. During a median follow-up of 9.4 years, 1083 deaths were identified. The restricted cubic spline revealed a nonlinear (p for nonlinearity = 0.002) relationship between ΔG and the risk of all-cause mortality. A multivariate-adjusted Cox regression model including glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) showed that ΔG > 5.55 mmol/L was associated with 30% (95% CI, 1.01-1.66) higher risk of all-cause mortality, as compared with ΔG 1.12-3.33 mmol/L. Higher ΔG is significantly related to an increased risk of all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes, suggesting that severe DP should be given more attention as a part of glucose management to reduce the risk of long-term adverse outcomes.",['Cai J; Peng P; Lu J; Shen Y; Wang C; Mo Y; Lu W; Zhu W; Xia T; Zhou J'],2024,"DP is an abnormal early morning blood glucose rise without nocturnal hypoglycaemia. participants were stratified into four groups by G. 1.11, 1.12-3.33, 3.34-5.55, and >5.55 mmol/L."
"Effectiveness of the ALT/AST ratio for predicting insulin resistance in a Korean population: A large-scale, cross-sectional cohort study.","Insulin resistance is a common pathophysiology in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Thus, screening for the risk of insulin resistance is important to prevent disease progression. We evaluated the alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) ratio to predict insulin resistance in the general population, regardless of comorbidities. Datasets from the 2015, 2019, and 2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used, and the following four indices were implemented to indicate insulin resistance: fasting serum glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and β-cell function. We analyzed the degree of association between the liver enzyme profile and insulin resistance indices using Pearson's correlation coefficient and determined the associations using linear or logistic regression analysis. Accordingly, ALT levels in both sexes were positively and consistently correlated with the four aforementioned insulin resistance indices in stratification analyses based on diabetes, dyslipidemia, alcohol consumption, and obesity status. In multivariate linear regression, when comparing with ALT levels, the ALT/AST ratio exhibited superior predictive performance for fasting serum glucose and HOMA-β in Korean men and improved outcomes for all insulin resistance indices in Korean women. In this analysis that included a large community-based population, the ALT/AST ratio was a more useful predictive marker than the HOMA-IR. Regarding the predicted presence or absence of insulin resistance, the ALT/AST ratio could better predict HOMA-IR than the ALT level alone in Koreans. A simple, precise marker that represents the ALT/AST ratio could be a practical method to screen for insulin resistance in the general population, regardless of diabetes mellitus, alcohol intake, and sex.",['Han SK; Seo MJ; Lee T; Kim MY'],2024,alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase ratio was used to predict insulin resistance.

Endoplasmic reticulum-resident selenoproteins and their roles in glucose and lipid metabolic disorders.,"Glucose and lipid metabolic disorders (GLMDs), such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and obesity, are significant public health issues that negatively impact human health. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a crucial role at the cellular level for lipid and sterol biosynthesis, intracellular calcium storage, and protein post-translational modifications. Imbalance and dysfunction of the ER can affect glucose and lipid metabolism. As an essential trace element, selenium contributes to various human physiological functions mainly through 25 types of selenoproteins (SELENOs). At least 10 SELENOs, with experimental and/or computational evidence, are predominantly found on the ER membrane or within its lumen. Two iodothyronine deiodinases (DIOs), DIO1 and DIO2, regulate the thyroid hormone deiodination in the thyroid and some external thyroid tissues, influencing glucose and lipid metabolism. Most of the other eight members maintain redox homeostasis in the ER. Especially, SELENOF, SELENOM, and SELENOS are involved in unfolded protein responses; SELENOI catalyzes phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis; SELENOK, SELENON, and SELENOT participate in calcium homeostasis regulation; and the biological significance of thioredoxin reductase 3 in the ER remains unexplored despite its established function in the thioredoxin system. This review examines recent research advances regarding ER SELENOs in GLMDs and aims to provide insights on ER-related pathology through SELENOs regulation.",['Shi Z; Han Z; Chen J; Zhou JC'],2024,"GLMDs are significant public health issues that negatively impact human health. the endoplasmic reticulum plays a crucial role at the cellular level. a key role in lipid and sterol biosynthesis, intracellular calcium storage, and protein post-translational modifications."
Changes in categorization or nomenclature within Neuroendocrine Tumours.,"The 5th Edition of WHO classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms is built to achieve a uniform terminology and to define a similar diagnostic scheme across different anatomical locations. At variance with the 4th edition, a chapter discussing neuroendocrine neoplasms in non-neuroendocrine organs has been introduced, that proposes a binary system for classification segregating well differentiated neoplasms, termed neuroendocrine tumors (NET), and poorly differentiated neoplasms, termed neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). A grading system for NET is based on mitotic index and/or Ki-67 index and/or necrosis, depending on the different location. If already well-established in the digestive system, this approach modifies and homogenize the classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms in the urinary tract, in female genital organs and in the male genital system. In the lung and thymus, the double terminology of carcinoid/NET, already introduced in the 5th Edition of the WHO classification of thoracic tumors, is endorsed. This approach undoubtedly helps the multidisciplinary approach for the diagnosis and clinical management of patients affected by these neoplasms, without losing site-specific characteristics that influence the clinical and biological behavior of tumors in different anatomical sites. Other major advances of the new WHO scheme are the homogenization of epidemiological data and the correct integration of data from prospective future studies aimed at the definition of molecular profiles and at the identification of tumor type-specific and patient-specific therapeutic approaches.",['Vocino Trucco G; Volante M'],2024,"5th edition of the WHO classification of neuroendocrine neoplasms is built to achieve a uniform terminology and define a similar diagnostic scheme across different anatomical locations. a binary system for classification segregating well differentiated neoplasms, termed neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and poorly differentiated neoplasms, termed neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC)"
[Incidence of common gene mutations in early-onset colorectal cancer and the association with cancer survival: a meta-analysis].,"<b>Objective:</b> The incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) is increasing globally; however, the molecular characteristics and prognosis of sporadic EOCRC are unclear. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the incidence of gene mutations and their association with cancer survival in sporadic EOCRC, focusing on six common gene mutations (<i>TP53, BRAF, KRAS, NRAS, PTEN,</i> and <i>APC</i>). <b>Methods:</b> Ovid Embase and Ovid Medline electronic databases were searched for studies involving patients with sporadic EOCRC (i.e., diagnosed with colorectal cancer before the age of 50 years and with no evidence of hereditary syndromes predisposing to colorectal cancer). The included articles were evaluated using quality assessment tools. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects and fixed-effects models. Cochran's Q statistic and the I2 index were used to assess heterogeneity. The incidence of the six common gene mutations listed above in sporadic EOCRC and their association with cancer survival were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> (1) <i>Incidence of specific gene mutations in sporadic EOCRC</i>.

Integrating single cell expression quantitative trait loci summary statistics to understand complex trait risk genes.,"Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a popular approach to dissect the functional consequence of disease associated non-coding variants. Most existing TWAS use bulk tissues and may not have the resolution to reveal cell-type specific target genes. Single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) datasets are emerging. The largest bulk- and sc-eQTL datasets are most conveniently available as summary statistics, but have not been broadly utilized in TWAS. Here, we present a new method EXPRESSO (EXpression PREdiction with Summary Statistics Only), to analyze sc-eQTL summary statistics, which also integrates 3D genomic data and epigenomic annotation to prioritize causal variants. EXPRESSO substantially improves existing methods. We apply EXPRESSO to analyze multi-ancestry GWAS datasets for 14 autoimmune diseases. EXPRESSO uniquely identifies 958 novel gene x trait associations, which is 26% more than the second-best method. Among them, 492 are unique to cell type level analysis and missed by TWAS using whole blood. We also develop a cell type aware drug repurposing pipeline, which leverages EXPRESSO results to identify drug compounds that can reverse disease gene expressions in relevant cell types. Our results point to multiple drugs with therapeutic potentials, including metformin for type 1 diabetes, and vitamin K for ulcerative colitis.",['Wang L; Khunsriraksakul C; Markus H; Chen D; Zhang F; Chen F; Zhan X; Carrel L; Liu DJ; Jiang B'],2024,"transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is a popular approach to dissect disease associated non-coding variants. most existing TWAS use bulk tissues and may not have the resolution to reveal cell-type specific target genes. largest bulk- and sc-eQTL datasets are most conveniently available as summary statistics, but have not been broadly utilized in TWAS."
"Association Between Ki-67 Proliferative Index and Oncotype-Dx Recurrence Score in Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Early Breast Cancers.

The cost of the test, which is not available in low-middle income countries (LMICs), is not within the means of most individuals. The Ki-67 index is a marker of tumor proliferation that is cost-effective and easily performed and has been substituted in many cases to obtain prognostic information. We aimed to identify the correlation between the ODx recurrence score (RS) and the Ki-67 index in HR-positive EBCs and to determine whether Ki-67, like the ODx, can help facilitate clinical decision-making. Systematic review correlating Ki-67 index and ODx in HR-positive and HER2-negative EBCs as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched different databases between January 2010 and May 2023 and included retrospective/prospective cohorts, clinical trials, case-control, and cross-sectional studies involving HR-positive and HER2-negative EBCs correlating the Ki-67 index and ODx RS categories. Of the 18 studies included, 16 indicated a positive or weakly positive correlation between ODx and the Ki-67 index. The combined <i>P</i> value of the included studies is <0.05 (<i>P</i> = .000), which shows a statistical significance between the 2. Our review also discusses the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in Ki-67 assessment, offering a cost-effective and reproducible alternative. Even although there are limitations, studies indicate a favorable association between ODx and the Ki-67 index in specific situations. This implies that Ki-67 can offer important predictive details, especially regarding the likelihood of relapse in HR-positive EBC. This is particularly significant in LMICs where financial constraints often hinder the availability of costly diagnostic tests.",['Mooghal M; Khan MAA; Samar MR; Shaikh H; Valimohammad AT; Idrees R; Abdul Rashid Y; Sattar AK'],2024,"oncotype-Dx (ODx) is a 21-gene assay used as a prognostic and predictive tool for hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, node-negative, or 1 to 3 lymph node-positive early breast cancers (EBCs) the cost of the test is not within the means of most individuals."
Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases and Outcomes Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (AIRDs) are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. However, the post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes in this population present a research gap, given the limited and discordant findings in existing studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between AIRDs and clinical outcomes after PCI; 9 studies with 7,027,270 patients (126,914 with AIRD, 6,900,356 without AIRD) were included. The AIRD cohort was characterized by an older age, a predominantly female demographic, and a greater prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Over a mean follow-up period of 4.6 ± 3.5 years, AIRD patients demonstrated significantly higher odds of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% CI: 1.25-1.78, <i>P</i> < .001) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (OR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01-2.62, <i>P</i> = .04) compared with non-AIRD patients. Sensitivity analysis using adjusted estimates, confirmed the higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.64, <i>P</i> = .01). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis had a significantly elevated odds of all-cause mortality (OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.27-1.77) and MACE (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.14-1.21). Our study demonstrated an association between AIRDs and suboptimal long-term outcomes post-PCI.

Sepsis risk in diabetic patients with urinary tract infection.,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) is a prevalent condition in those with diabetes, and in severe cases, it may escalate to sepsis. Therefore, it is important to analyze the risk variables associated with sepsis in diabetes individuals with UTI. This research was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis. From January 2011 to June 2022, a group of individuals with diabetes were identified as having UTI at a tertiary hospital situated in Southeastern China. Patient data, including information on urine culture, was collected retrospectively from a clinical record database. The participants were categorized into the sepsis and non-sepsis groups. The risk variables were derived using both uni-and multiple- variable regression analysis. The research included 1919 patients, of whom 1106 cases (57.63%) had positive urine cultures. In total, 445 blood culture samples were tested, identifying 186 positive cases (41.80%). The prevalence of bacteria in urine and blood samples was highest for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. Moreover, 268 individuals (13.97%) exhibited sepsis. The regression analysis indicated a positive correlation between sepsis and albumin (ALB)<34.35 g/L, C-reactive protein (CRP)>55.84 mg/L and white blood cell count (WBC) >8.485 X 109/L in diabetic cases with UTIs. By integrating the three aforementioned parameters, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.809.

"Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes: Insights into clinical efficacy, patient-reported outcomes, and adherence challenges.","Insulin therapy plays a crucial role in the management of type 2 diabetes as the disease progresses. Over the past century, insulin formulations have undergone significant modifications and bioengineering, resulting in a diverse range of available insulin products. These products show distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Consequently, various insulin regimens have em-erged for the management of type 2 diabetes, including premixed formulations and combinations of basal and bolus insulins. The utilization of different insulin regimens yields disparate clinical outcomes, adverse events, and, notably, patient-reported outcomes (PROs). PROs provide valuable insights from the patient's perspective, serving as a valuable mine of information for enhancing healthcare and informing clinical decisions. Adherence to insulin therapy, a critical patient-reported outcome, significantly affects clinical outcomes and is influenced by multiple factors.

Predictors of and barriers to follow-up uptake: analysis of factors and perceived barriers among high-risk individuals with diabetes after screening in China.,"The objective of this study was to identify variables that predict adherence to follow-up visits among people who are positive for diabetes during screening and to investigate barriers to follow-up. A retrospective cohort study linking individual-level registry data was performed. First, we compared the characteristics of attenders and non-attenders. Second, we investigated perceived barriers using a questionnaire in a random sample of people who failed to attend the follow-up visit. A total of 27,806 (16.4%) patients attended the follow-up visits. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals aged ≥75 years were more likely to attend follow-up than were those aged 35-45 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.97 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.82-2.15]), male (OR: 1.15 [95% CI: 1.12-1.18]), obese (OR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.29-1.43]), had positive family history of diabetes (OR: 1.37 [95% CI: 1.30-1.45]), hypertension (OR: 1.05 [95% CI: 1.01-1.09]), high glucose levels (OR: 1.10 [95% CI: 1.09-1.11]), and high diabetes risk scores (OR: 1.02 [95% CI: 1.02-1.03]) facilitated follow-up. However, overweight (OR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92-0.99]) and central obesity (OR: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.83-0.90]) predicted no follow-up. Among nonattenders, diabetes beliefs, time restrictions and distance from home to hospitals were the top three barriers hindering follow-up visits.

DDLA: a double deep latent autoencoder for diabetic retinopathy diagnose based on continuous glucose sensors.,"The current diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is based on fundus images and clinical experience. However, considering the ineffectiveness and non-portability of medical devices, we aimed to develop a diagnostic model for diabetic retinopathy based on glucose series data from the wearable continuous glucose monitoring system. Therefore, this study developed a novel method, i.e., double deep latent autoencoder, for exploring glycemic variability influence from multi-day glucose data for diabetic retinopathy. Specifically, the model proposed in this research could encode continuous glucose sensor data with non-continuous and variable length via the integration of a data reorganization module and a novel encoding module with fragmented-missing-wise objective function. Additionally, the model implements a double deep autoencoder, which integrated convolutional neural network, long short-term memory, to jointly capturing the inter-day and intra-day glucose latent features from glucose series. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated through a cross-validation method to clinical datasets of 765 type 2 diabetes patients. The proposed method achieves the highest accuracy value (0.89), precision value (0.88), and F1 score (0.73). The results suggest that our model can be used to remotely diagnose and screen for diabetic retinopathy by learning potential features of glucose series data collected by wearable continuous glucose monitoring systems.",['Tao R; Li H; Lu J; Huang Y; Wang Y; Lu W; Shao X; Zhou J; Yu X'],2024,model could encode continuous glucose sensor data with non-continuous and variable length. model implements a double deep autoencoder to jointly capture the inter-day and intra-day glucose latent features from glucose series.

Improving Compliance with a Nurse-Driven Protocol for Unfractionated Heparin Infusions in Patients with Venous Thromboembolism.,"Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is a high-risk medication that can cause bleeding and/or thrombotic complications if not managed appropriately. Between January and July 2019, our institution experienced a high number of patient safety events related to UFH infusion for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this quality improvement (QI) initiative was to prevent these safety events by improving compliance with our institution's nurse-driven VTE UFH infusion protocol. Baseline data for patients on the VTE UFH protocol were collected to identify improvement opportunities. Compliance with eight standards of care related to the VTE UFH infusion protocol was measured. Time to first therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was recorded to assess the benefit of improved compliance. Institutional policy updates were made to clarify the management of UFH infusions and documentation in the electronic health record. A multidisciplinary workgroup implemented order set changes, nursing communication orders, UFH infusion reports, and a nursing education module to promote compliance with the protocol. The overall rate of compliance with the VTE UFH infusion protocol increased from 79.4% at baseline to 85.2% following implementation of the QI initiative, and the median time to first therapeutic aPTT decreased from 831.5 minutes to 808 minutes over the same period. A multidisciplinary initiative to address improvement opportunities in a nurse-driven UFH protocol for VTE treatment increased compliance with the protocol and decreased the time to first therapeutic aPTT.",['Toale KM; Butler G; Richardson G; Beno J; Jawe N'],2024,UFH is a high-risk medication that can cause bleeding and/or thrombotic complications if not managed appropriately. the aim of this quality improvement (QI) initiative was to prevent these safety events by improving compliance with the nurse-driven UFH infusion protocol.

Transcriptional control of metabolism by interferon regulatory factors.,"Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) comprise a family of nine transcription factors in mammals. IRFs exert broad effects on almost all aspects of immunity but are best known for their role in the antiviral response. Over the past two decades, IRFs have been implicated in metabolic physiology and pathophysiology, partly as a result of their known functions in immune cells, but also because of direct actions in adipocytes, hepatocytes, myocytes and neurons. This Review focuses predominantly on IRF3 and IRF4, which have been the subject of the most intense investigation in this area. IRF3 is located in the cytosol and undergoes activation and nuclear translocation in response to various signals, including stimulation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors and the cGAS-STING pathways. IRF3 promotes weight gain, primarily by inhibiting adipose thermogenesis, and also induces inflammation and insulin resistance using both weight-dependent and weight-independent mechanisms. IRF4, meanwhile, is generally pro-thermogenic and anti-inflammatory and has profound effects on lipogenesis and lipolysis. Finally, new data are emerging on the role of other IRF family members in metabolic homeostasis. Taken together, data indicate that IRFs serve as critical yet underappreciated integrators of metabolic and inflammatory stress.",['Ahmad Z; Kahloan W; Rosen ED'],2024,IRFs exert broad effects on almost all aspects of immunity. they are best known for their role in the antiviral response. they are most known for their role in the antiviral response.
Associations of serum D-dimer and glycosylated hemoglobin levels with third-trimester fetal growth restriction in gestational diabetes mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a special type of diabetes that commonly occurs in women during pregnancy and involves impaired glucose tolerance and abnormal glucose metabolism; GDM is diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy and can affect fetal growth and development. To investigate the associations of serum D-dimer (D-D) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with third-trimester fetal growth restriction (FGR) in GDM patients. The clinical data of 164 pregnant women who were diagnosed with GDM and delivered at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University from January 2021 to January 2023 were analyzed retrospectively. Among these women, 63 whose fetuses had FGR were included in the FGR group, and 101 women whose fetuses had normal body weights were included in the normal body weight group (normal group). Fasting venous blood samples were collected from the elbow at 28-30 wk gestation and 1-3 d before delivery to measure serum D-D and HbA1c levels for comparative analysis. The diagnostic value of serum D-D and HbA1c levels for FGR was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the influencing factors of third-trimester FGR in GDM patients were analyzed by logistic regression. Serum fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, D-D and HbA1c levels were significantly greater in the FGR group than in the normal group, while the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values were lower (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Regarding the diagnosis of FGR based on serum D-D and HbA1c levels, the areas under the curves (AUCs) were 0.826 and 0.848, the cutoff values were 3.04 mg/L and 5.80%, the sensitivities were 81.0% and 79.4%, and the specificities were 88.1% and 87.1%, respectively. The AUC of serum D-D plus HbA1c levels for diagnosing FGR was 0.928, and the sensitivity and specificity were 84.1% and 91.1%, respectively. High D-D and HbA1c levels were risk factors for third-trimester FGR in GDM patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05). D-D and HbA1c levels can indicate the occurrence of FGR in GDM patients in the third trimester of pregnancy to some extent, and their combination can be used as an important index for the early prediction of FGR.",['Zhang Y; Li T; Yue CY; Liu Y'],2024,164 pregnant women were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). the disease is a special type of diabetes that commonly occurs in women during pregnancy. it involves impaired glucose tolerance and abnormal glucose metabolism.
Insight into heavy metal chemical fractions in ash collected from municipal and industrial waste incinerators in northern Vietnam.,"This investigation involved the collection of fly ash and bottom ash specimens from seven waste incinerators situated in the northern provinces of Vietnam, aimed at assessing the composition and distribution patterns of five chemical fractions of heavy metals (Pb, Cr, As, Cd Cu, and Zn) present in incinerator waste ash. The outcomes reveal that fly ash exhibited a relatively elevated concentration of industrial waste metals (25-66%) such as As, Cd, and Pb primarily in exchangeable (F1) and carbonate fractions (F2), which are mobile forms susceptible to environmental dissolution and consequential bioaccumulation posing health risks to humans. The predominant states of the metals Cr, Cu, and Zn were identified as residual, Fe-Mn oxide, and carbonate, respectively, with their relative proportions showing minimal variation. Conversely, heavy metals were predominantly present in residual residue and Fe-Mn bound form (F3) in bottom ash derived from both residential and commercial waste incineration operations. The non-carcinogenic hazard indices (HI) associated with the examined metals, ranked for both adults and children, were as follows: Pb > Cr > As > Cd > Cu > Zn. Notably, the HI values for Pb, Cr, and As exceeded the permissible threshold (HI > 1) for children. However, the risk of As, Cd, and Pb-related cancer <i>via</i> exposure pathways remained within acceptable limits for both age groups. Conversely, the probability of carcinogenic effects attributable to Cr surpassed the permissible threshold (>10<sup>-4</sup>), indicating significant health concerns associated with heavy metals in waste incinerators for humans, particularly children.",['Thuy Nguyen TT; Vuong TX; Ha Pham TT; Hoang QA; Tu BM; Nguyen TH; Phuong Nguyen TT'],2024,"fly ash and bottom ash specimens were collected from seven waste incinerators. the results reveal that fly ash exhibited a relatively elevated concentration of industrial waste metals. the predominant states of the metals Cr, Cu, and Zn were identified as residual, Fe-Mn oxide, and carbonate."
Polycytosine RNA-binding protein 1 regulates osteoblast function <i>via</i> a ferroptosis pathway in type 2 diabetic osteoporosis.,"Recently, type 2 diabetic osteoporosis (T2DOP) has become a research hotspot for the complications of diabetes, but the specific mechanism of its occurrence and development remains unknown. Ferroptosis caused by iron overload is con-sidered an important cause of T2DOP. Polycytosine RNA-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), an iron ion chaperone, is considered a protector of ferroptosis. To investigate the existence of ferroptosis and specific role of PCBP1 in the development of type 2 diabetes. A cell counting kit-8 assay was used to detect changes in osteoblast viability under high glucose (HG) and/or ferroptosis inhibitors at different concentrations and times. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the morphological changes in the mitochondria of osteoblasts under HG, and western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of PCBP1, ferritin, and the ferroptosis-related protein glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). A lentivirus silenced and overexpressed PCBP1. Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of the osteoblast functional proteins osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (OCN), whereas flow cytometry was used to detect changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in each group. Under HG, the viability of osteoblasts was considerably decreased, the number of mitochondria undergoing atrophy was considerably increased, PCBP1 and ferritin expression levels were increased, and GPX4 expression was decreased. Western blotting results demonstrated that infection with lentivirus overexpressing PCBP1, increased the expression levels of ferritin, GPX4, OPG, and OCN, compared with the HG group. Flow cytometry results showed a reduction in ROS, and an opposite result was obtained after silencing PCBP1. PCBP1 may protect osteoblasts and reduce the harm caused by ferroptosis by promoting ferritin expression under a HG environment. Moreover, PCBP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for T2DOP.",['Ma HD; Shi L; Li HT; Wang XD; Yang MW'],2024,ferroptosis is con-sidered an important cause of T2DOP. iron ion chaperone is considered a protector of ferroptosis. western blotting was used to detect expression levels of osteoblast functional proteins osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteocalcin (GPX4).
"Establishment of a Risk Prediction Model for Metabolic Syndrome in High Altitude Areas in Qinghai Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study.","The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing worldwide, and early prediction of MetS risk is highly beneficial for health outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to predict MetS risk in Qinghai Province, China, and it provides a methodological reference for MetS prevention and control in Qinghai Province, China. A total of 3073 participants living between 1900 and 3710 meters above sea level in Qinghai Province participated in this study between March 2014 and March 2016. We omitted 12 subjects who were missing diagnostic component data for MetS, ultimately resulting in 3061 research subjects, 70% of the subjects were assigned randomly to the training set, and the remaining subjects were assigned to the validation set. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis method was used for variable selection via running cyclic coordinate descent with 10-fold cross-validation. Multivariable logistic regression was then performed to develop a predictive model and nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used for model evaluation, and calibration plot and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used for model validation. Of 24 variables studied, 6 risk predictors were identified by LASSO regression analysis: hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycemia, abdominal obesity, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body mass index (BMI). A prediction model including these 6 risk factors was constructed and displayed good predictability with an area under the ROC curve of 0.914 for the training set and 0.930 for the validation set. DCA revealed that if the threshold probability of MetS is less than 82%, the application of this nomogram is more beneficial than both the treat-all or treat-none strategies.

"Systematic review of cellular, acellular and matrix-like products (CAMPs) and indirect treatment comparison between cellular/acellular and amniotic/non-amniotic grafts in the management of diabetic foot ulcers.","This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-compliant review focuses on the efficacy of cellular, acellular and matrix-like products (CAMPs) in the management of diabetic foot ulcers based on published randomized control trials (RCTs). While CAMPs have been incorporated into the clinical algorithm for chronic wounds, evidence is lacking to comparatively evaluate the efficacy of these products. Level 1 RCT studies are the gold standard to evaluate efficacy of different treatment approaches, however, due to differences in surgical techniques, patient demographics and compliance, standard of care outcomes in the wound care space can vary significantly between different randomized controlled trials, making it difficult to compare them against each other. To mitigate variability between different RCTs, wound closure outcomes can be reported as risk ratios. This review of all currently published RCTs (with similar trial design) in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients and risk ratios, confirms that CAMPs adjunct to standard of care result in statistically superior wound closure outcome in diabetic foot ulcers, when compared to standard of care alone, with a Risk Ratio (RR) of 1.72 [1.56, 1.90], p< 0.00001. Enough evidence is still lacking to determine a statistical difference between broad categories of cellular/acellular and amniotic/non-amniotic CAMPs; and hence decision makers should consider published head-head comparative studies, real-world evidence and cost-effectiveness evidence between individual CAMPs to decide on which to use in practice.",['Banerjee J; Lasiter A; Nherera L'],2024,"review focuses on efficacy of cellular, acellular and matrix-like products. compared to standard of care alone, it is still lacking to determine a statistical difference between broad categories of cellular/acellular and amniotic/non-amniotic CAMPs."
Sleep health among US Navy afloat versus ashore personnel in the Millennium Cohort Study.,"Despite emerging public concern regarding the sleep health of military personnel over the past two decades, there remains a dearth of research examining sleep health among naval personnel assigned to sea duty. This study examined sleep metrics (e.g. fatigue, short sleep duration) and mental (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder, depression) and physical health (e.g. type 2 diabetes, bodily pain) outcomes among naval personnel with recent sea duty (i.e. afloat) compared with naval personnel with recent shore duty (i.e. ashore). Prevalence ratios and mean differences for all outcomes were estimated and adjusted for demographic and military variables, and subsequently stratified by obesity. Sleep metrics were similar between afloat and ashore sailors except for short sleep duration, while sailors with recent shore duty had poorer physical health compared with those with recent sea duty. Stratified analyses suggested naval personnel with obesity had a higher proportion of nearly all adverse sleep-related health outcomes than those without obesity. Among participants without obesity, afloat personnel were more likely to report very short sleep (≤ 5 hours) and fewer hours of average nightly sleep, but were less likely to report physical health outcomes compared with ashore personnel. These findings suggest potential differences in sleep metrics and sleep-related health outcomes between afloat and ashore naval personnel. Additional research examining sleep outcomes using more objective measures is required to further investigate these findings, which may inform strategies to foster consolidated sleep despite environmental and occupational challenges in order to maintain high-performing naval personnel.",['Jacobson IG; Harbertson J; Sharifian N; Rull RP; Steele CT; Russell DW'],2024,"study examined sleep metrics (e.g. fatigue, short sleep duration) and mental (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder, depression) and physical health outcomes among naval personnel assigned to sea duty. afloat and ashore sailors had poorer physical health compared with sea duty."

"Adjuvant treatment strategy evolution and risk stratification for hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative early breast cancer in China.","Patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (EBC) with high-risk clinicopathological features face an increased risk of recurrence. This study explored the evolving treatment landscape and clinical outcomes in patients with EBC using a nationwide database. The study cohort comprised HR+/HER2-, stages 1-3, patients with EBC who underwent surgery and received adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) from January 2013 to March 2021. High-risk patients were defined by ≥4 positive axillary lymph nodes, or 1-3 positive lymph node(s) with at least one high-risk feature (histologic grade 3, tumor size ≥5 cm, or Ki-67 ≥20%). A low-risk cohort included patients not meeting the criteria. Survival analysis was conducted with a cutoff of September 2021. The study included 4088 eligible patients (1310 high-risk patients and 2778 low-risk patients). High-risk patients were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared to low-risk patients. From 2013 to 2021, an increasing proportion of patients received aromatase inhibitors and ovarian function suppression as part of their AET. The 2-, 5-, and 7-year invasive disease-free survival for high-risk cohort were 90.67%, 75.26%, and 57.10%, respectively, these rates were notably higher for low-risk cohort at 97.14%, 89.85%, and 84.83%. High-risk patients demonstrated a higher risk of recurrence or death compared with low-risk patients (hazard ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.82-3.12). In the setting of standard or even intensive AET, patients with EBC with high-risk features still present high recurrence risk, highlighting the urgent need for innovative adjuvant treatment strategies.",['Fan Y; Ji D; Jiang M; Tan Y; Yang Y; Li T; Ma X; Xu B'],2024,"high-risk patients with histologic grade 3, tumor size 5 cm, or Ki-67 20%) were defined by 4 positive axillary lymph nodes. high-risk patients were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared to low-risk patients."
Native Kidney Renal Cell Carcinoma in Renal Allograft Transplant Patients - Our Experience.,"The immunosuppression administered to renal transplant recipients to safeguard renal function elevates their susceptibility to renal cancer, which is estimated to be 15 times higher than in the general population. The current study aimed to analyze various aspects of native kidney renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in renal transplant recipients. This study involved a retrospective analysis of 11 patients who underwent nephrectomy for RCC in native kidneys among renal transplant recipients at our institution since 1992. Our institutional incidence was 0.4%. Median age at presentation was 57 (49-60) years. The ratio of male: female was 10:1. Most patients were asymptomatic at presentation and native kidney disease before transplantation was undetermined. In our study, the median time interval between diagnosis of RCC and transplant was 9.1 (8.4-11.2) years. All patients underwent native kidney nephrectomy. Clear cell type was more common than papillary type, 3.5 (2.5-4.2). Ten patients were diagnosed with stage I disease and one patient had stage IV disease. Fuhrman nuclear grading revealed low grades in nine patients and three patients had Grade 3. Immunosuppressive therapy modification was done in nine patients. Meticulous follow-up of renal transplant patients is essential for earlier diagnosis and appropriate treatment of native kidney RCC in transplant recipients. Authors recommend every year follow-up in transplant recipients with special emphasis on ultrasound of native kidney.",['Survase P; Agrawal S; Singh A; Sabnes R; Desai M'],2024,the immunosuppression administered to renal transplant recipients elevates their susceptibility to renal cancer. the study involved a retrospective analysis of 11 patients who underwent nephrectomy for native kidney renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in renal transplant recipients.
Application and progress of artificial intelligence in radiation therapy dose prediction.,"Radiation therapy (RT) nowadays is a main treatment modality of cancer. To ensure the therapeutic efficacy of patients, accurate dose distribution is often required, which is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In addition, due to the differences in knowledge and experience among participants and diverse institutions, the predicted dose are often inconsistent. In last several decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in various aspects of RT, several products have been implemented in clinical practice and confirmed superiority. In this paper, we will review the research of AI in dose prediction, focusing on the progress in deep learning (DL).",['Jiang C; Ji T; Qiao Q'],2024,"radiation therapy is a main treatment modality of cancer. to ensure the therapeutic efficacy of patients, accurate dose distribution is often required. due to the differences in knowledge and experience among participants, the predicted dose are often inconsistent."
Black raspberry-mediated metabolic changes in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis associated with rectal polyp regression.,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients face an almost certain 100% risk of developing colorectal cancer, necessitating prophylactic colectomy to prevent disease progression. A crucial goal is to hinder this progression. In a recent clinical trial involving 14 FAP patients, half received 60 g of black raspberry (BRB) powder orally and BRB suppositories at bedtime, while the other half received only BRB suppositories at bedtime over 9 months. This intervention led to a notable reduction in rectal polyps for 11 patients, although 3 showed no response. In this study, we delved into the metabolic changes induced by BRBs in the same patient cohort. Employing mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics, we analyzed pre- and post-BRB urinary and plasma samples from the 11 responders. The results showed significant alterations in 23 urinary and 6 plasma metabolites, influencing various pathways including polyamine, glutathione metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, inositol metabolism, and benzoate production. BRBs notably elevated levels of several metabolites associated with these pathways, suggesting a potential mechanism through which BRBs facilitate rectal polyp regression in FAP patients by modulating multiple metabolic pathways. Notably, metabolites derived from BRB polyphenols were significantly increased post-BRB intervention, emphasizing the potential therapeutic value of BRBs in FAP management.",['Huang YW; Chen HZ; Niu B; Wu W; Gao H; Yu J; Wang LS'],2024,adenomatous polyposis patients face an almost certain 100% risk of developing colorectal cancer. the treatment led to a notable reduction in rectal polyps for 11 patients. the results showed significant alterations in 23 urinary and 6 plasma metabolites.
Non-invasive prenatal screening: Testing motivations and decision making in the low-risk population.,"Non-invasive prenatal screening provides a risk assessment for aneuploidies by utilizing cell-free DNA (cfDNA). It is recommended that cell-free DNA screening (cfDNA screening) be offered to all pregnant people regardless of a priori risk for aneuploidy. In the absence of an increased risk, alternative motives for electing cfDNA screening and different levels of informed decision making may arise. Therefore, our study aimed to characterize low-risk patients' motivations for cfDNA screening election, determine how often informed decisions are being made, and compare motivations between informed and uninformed decision makers. A survey that included a modified, validated measure of informed choice (MMIC) and questions to assess patients' motivations for cfDNA screening was offered at four MFM clinics following genetic counseling. It was found that 44% of participants (n = 100) made an uninformed decision about testing. Participants with private insurers were 4.25 times more likely to make an informed decision (95% CI = 1.10-16.37). Informed decision makers scored avoiding invasive procedures higher (p = 0.007) and ranked doing what family/friends desire lower (p = 0.005) than uninformed decision makers. While most participants scored receiving information about genetic conditions highest, 12% of participants reported fetal sex disclosure as a priority. However, this was not found to be associated with uninformed decision making. This study ultimately established that following genetic counseling, a low-risk population shared motivations with high-risk populations which highlights the importance of complete pre-test counseling for all. Future research should investigate the effect of modifying variables, such as socioeconomic status, on the performance of informed choice measures and critically evaluate the parameters that determine informed choice.",['Lea JK; Stevens BK; Mulligan S; Hashmi SS; Lunstroth R; Choates MG'],2024,"non-invasive prenatal screening provides a risk assessment for aneuploidies. it is recommended that cell-free DNA screening be offered to all pregnant people regardless of a priori risk for aneuploidy. in the absence of an increased risk, alternative motives for electing cfDNA screening may arise."
Financial hardship experience in middle- and older-aged patients with advanced lung cancer.,"Advancements in medical treatments have resulted in increased medical costs for cancer patients. More than half of the patients with advanced lung cancer reported unmet financial needs. The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in the prevalence and correlates of financial hardship between middle- and older-aged patients with advanced lung cancer, and its impact on multiple health-related outcomes. This study presents a cross-sectional analysis involving 226 patients with advanced lung cancer, who were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial conducted between 2018 and 2020. Data collection was performed through self-reported questionnaires and electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were adopted for analysis. 58.0% reported experiencing financial hardships. Middle-aged participants who were single and had a lower education level were more likely to experience financial difficulties. However, males and higher performance status were associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing financial difficulties among older-aged participants. Financial hardship was significantly associated with anxiety (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), quality of life, global health status (p = 0.002), functional scale score (p < 0.001), symptom scale score (p < 0.001), and lung cancer-specific scale score (p < 0.001). More than half of the patients with advanced lung cancer experienced financial hardships caused by cancer or its treatment, with a higher prevalence reported in middle-aged patients. Different sociodemographic and clinical variables correlated with financial hardship in middle- and older-aged participants, respectively. More attention should be paid to middle-aged patients with advanced lung cancer, particularly during routine assessments.",['Takemura N; Jia S; Lin CC'],2024,more than half of patients with advanced lung cancer reported unmet financial needs. study presents cross-sectional analysis involving 226 patients with advanced lung cancer. 58.0% reported experiencing financial hardships.
Cleaning and Harmonizing Medical Image Data for Reliable AI: Lessons Learned from Longitudinal Oral Cancer Natural History Study Data.,"For deep learning-based machine learning, not only are large and sufficiently diverse data crucial but their good qualities are equally important. However, in real-world applications, it is very common that raw source data may contain incorrect, noisy, inconsistent, improperly formatted and sometimes missing elements, particularly, when the datasets are large and sourced from many sites. In this paper, we present our work towards preparing and making image data ready for the development of AI-driven approaches for studying various aspects of the natural history of oral cancer. Specifically, we focus on two aspects: 1) cleaning the image data; and 2) extracting the annotation information. Data cleaning includes removing duplicates, identifying missing data, correcting errors, standardizing data sets, and removing personal sensitive information, toward combining data sourced from different study sites. These steps are often collectively referred to as data harmonization. Annotation information extraction includes identifying crucial or valuable texts that are manually entered by clinical providers related to the image paths/names and standardizing of the texts of labels. Both are important for the successful deep learning algorithm development and data analyses. Specifically, we provide details on the data under consideration, describe the challenges and issues we observed that motivated our work, present specific approaches and methods that we used to clean and standardize the image data and extract labelling information. Further, we discuss the ways to increase efficiency of the process and the lessons learned. Research ideas on automating the process with ML-driven techniques are also presented and discussed. Our intent in reporting and discussing such work in detail is to help provide insights in automating or, minimally, increasing the efficiency of these critical yet often under-reported processes.",['Xue Z; Oguguo T; Yu KJ; Chen TC; Hua CH; Kang CJ; Chien CY; Tsai MH; Wang CP; Chaturvedi AK; Antani S'],2024,"data cleaning includes removing duplicates, correcting errors, standardizing data sets, and removing personal sensitive information. we present our work towards preparing and making image data ready for the development of AI-driven approaches for studying oral cancer."
Investigating the Potential Therapeutic Mechanisms of Puerarin in Neurological Diseases.,"Plants and their derived phytochemicals have a long history of treating a wide range of illnesses for several decades. They are believed to be the origin of a diverse array of medicinal compounds. One of the compounds found in kudzu root is puerarin, a isoflavone glycoside commonly used as an alternative medicine to treat various diseases. From a biological perspective, puerarin can be described as a white needle crystal with the chemical name of 7-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-benzopyran-4-one-8-D-glucopyranoside. Besides, puerarin is sparingly soluble in water and produces no color or light yellow solution. Multiple experimental and clinical studies have confirmed the significant therapeutic effects of puerarin. These effects span a wide range of pharmacological effects, including neuroprotection, hepatoprotection, cardioprotection, immunomodulation, anticancer properties, anti-diabetic properties, anti-osteoporosis properties, and more. Puerarin achieves these effects by interacting with various cellular and molecular pathways, such as MAPK, AMPK, NF-κB, mTOR, β-catenin, and PKB/Akt, as well as different receptors, enzymes, and growth factors. The current review highlights the molecular mechanism of puerarin as a neuroprotective agent in the treatment of various neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. Extensive cellular, animal, and clinical research has provided valuable insights into its effectiveness in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, cerebral stroke, depression, and more.",['Chauhan P; Wadhwa K; Mishra R; Gupta S; Ahmad F; Kamal M; Iqbal D; Alsaweed M; Nuli MV; Abomughaid MM; Almutary AG; Mishra PC; Jha SK; Ojha S; Nelson VK; Dargar A; Singh G; Jha NK'],2024,puerarin is a white needle crystal commonly used as an alternative medicine to treat various diseases. puerarin is sparingly soluble in water and produces no color or light yellow solution.
The role of interleukin-36 in health and disease states.,"The interleukin (IL)-1 superfamily upregulates immune responses and maintains homeostasis between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Within the IL-1 superfamily, IL-36 plays a pivotal role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Of the four IL-36 isoforms, three have agonist activity (IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ) and the fourth has antagonist activity (IL-36 receptor antagonist [IL-36Ra]). All IL-36 isoforms bind to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R). Binding of IL-36α/β/γ to the IL-36R recruits the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) and activates downstream signalling pathways mediated by nuclear transcription factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathways. Antagonist binding of IL-36Ra to IL-36R inhibits recruitment of IL-1RAcP, blocking downstream signalling pathways. Changes in the balance within the IL-36 cytokine family can lead to uncontrolled inflammatory responses throughout the body. As such, IL-36 has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, notably a type of pustular psoriasis called generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a chronic, rare, potentially life-threatening, multisystemic skin disease characterised by recurrent fever and extensive sterile pustules. In GPP, IL-36 is central to disease pathogenesis, and the prevention of IL-36-mediated signalling can improve clinical outcomes. In this review, we summarize the literature describing the biological functions of the IL-36 pathway. We also consider the evidence for uncontrolled activation of the IL-36 pathway in a wide range of skin (e.g., plaque psoriasis, pustular psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, Netherton syndrome, atopic dermatitis and pyoderma gangrenosum), lung (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), gut (e.g., intestinal fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease and Hirschsprung's disease), kidney (e.g., renal tubulointerstitial lesions) and infectious diseases caused by a variety of pathogens (e.g., COVID-19; Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae infections), as well as in cancer. We also consider how targeting the IL-36 signalling pathway could be used in treating inflammatory disease states.",['Sugiura K; Fujita H; Komine M; Yamanaka K; Akiyama M'],2024,interleukin (IL)-1 superfamily upregulates immune responses.

Comparison of Doppler Imaging and Microvascular Imaging in Cervical Lymph Node Blood Flow Analysis.,"Cervical lymph node metastasis is an important determinant of cancer stage and the selection of an appropriate treatment plan for patients with head and neck cancer. Therefore, metastatic cervical lymph nodes should be effectively differentiated from lymphoma, tuberculous lymphadenitis, and other benign lymphadenopathies. The aim of this work is to describe the performance of Doppler ultrasound and superb microvascular imaging (SMI) in evaluating blood flow information of cervical lymph nodes. In addition, the features of flow imaging in metastatic lymph nodes, lymphoma, and tuberculous lymphadenitis were described. Compared with Doppler ultrasound, SMI, the latest blood flow imaging technology, could detect more blood flow signals because the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of SMI in the diagnosis of cervical lymph node disease were higher. This article summarizes the value of Doppler ultrasound and SMI in evaluating cervical lymph node diseases and focuses on the diagnostic performance of SMI.",['Yang Z; Cai J; Wang Y; Shu L; Liu W; Wang Z'],2024,"metastatic cervical lymph nodes should be effectively differentiated from lymphoma, tuberculous lymphadenitis, and other benign lymphadenopathies. the aim of this work is to describe the performance of Doppler ultrasound and superb microvascular imaging (SMI) in evaluating blood flow information of cervical lymph nodes."
Proteomic snapshot of saliva samples predicts new pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.,"Information on the microbiome's human pathways and active members that can affect SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and pathogenesis in the salivary proteome is very scarce. Here, we studied a unique collection of samples harvested from April to June 2020 from unvaccinated patients. We compared 10 infected and hospitalized patients with severe (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with 10 uninfected individuals, including non-COVID-19 but susceptible individuals (n = 5) and non-COVID-19 and nonsusceptible healthcare workers with repeated high-risk exposures (n = 5). By performing high-throughput proteomic profiling in saliva samples, we detected 226 unique differentially expressed (DE) human proteins between groups (q-value ≤ 0.05) out of 3376 unambiguously identified proteins (false discovery rate ≤ 1%). Major differences were observed between the non-COVID-19 and nonsusceptible groups. Bioinformatics analysis of DE proteins revealed human proteomic signatures related to inflammatory responses, central cellular processes, and antiviral activity associated with the saliva of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (p-value ≤ 0.0004). Discriminatory biomarker signatures from human saliva include cystatins, protective molecules present in the oral cavity, calprotectins, involved in cell cycle progression, and histones, related to nucleosome functions. The expression levels of two human proteins related to protein transport in the cytoplasm, DYNC1 (p-value, 0.0021) and MAPRE1 (p-value, 0.047), correlated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plasma activity. Finally, the proteomes of microorganisms present in the saliva samples showed 4 main microbial functional features related to ribosome functioning that were overrepresented in the infected group. Our study explores potential candidates involved in pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, although further studies in larger cohorts will be necessary.",['Moreno E; Ciordia S; Fátima SM; Jiménez D; Martínez-Sanz J; Vizcarra P; Ron R; Sánchez-Conde M; Bargiela R; Sanchez-Carrillo S; Moreno S; Corrales F; Ferrer M; Serrano-Villar S'],2024,samples from unvaccinated patients were harvested from April to June 2020. they were compared with 10 uninfected patients with severe (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) coronavirus disease. compared with 10 uninfected patients with severe (n = 5) and moderate (n = 5) coronavirus disease.

Early diagnosis of persons with von Willebrand disease using a machine learning algorithm and real-world data.,"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is underdiagnosed, often delaying treatment. VWD claims coding is limited, including no severity qualifiers; improved identification methods for VWD are needed. This study's aim: identify and characterize undiagnosed symptomatic persons with VWD in the US using medical insurance claims to develop predictive machine learning (ML) models. Diagnosed andpotentially undiagnosed VWD cohorts were defined using Komodo longitudinal USclaims data (January 2015-March 2020). ML models were built using keycharacteristics predictive of VWD diagnosis from the diagnosed cohort. Two MLmodels predicted VWD diagnosis with the highest accuracy in females (randomforest; 84%) and males (gradient boosting machine; 85%). Undiagnosed personssuspected to have VWD were identified using an 80% cutoff probability; profilesof key characteristics were constructed. The trained MLmodels were applied to the undiagnosed cohort (28,463 females; 20439 males)with suspected VWD. 52% of undiagnosed females had heavy menstrual bleeding, akey pre-diagnosis symptom. Undiagnosed males tended to have more frequentmedical procedures, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits compared withundiagnosed females.

A platinum(IV)-artesunate complex triggers ferroptosis by boosting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation to enhance tumor immunotherapy.,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death form that initiates lipid peroxidation (LPO) in tumors. In recent years, there has been growing interest on ferroptosis, but how to propel it forward translational medicine remains in mist. Although experimental ferroptosis inducers such as RSL3 and erastin have demonstrated bioactivity in vitro, the poor antitumor outcome in animal model limits their development. In this study, we reveal a novel ferroptosis inducer, oxaliplatin-artesunate (OART), which exhibits substantial bioactivity in vitro and vivo, and we verify its feasibility in cancer immunotherapy. For mechanism, OART induces cytoplasmic and mitochondrial LPO to promote tumor ferroptosis, via inhibiting glutathione-mediated ferroptosis defense system, enhancing iron-dependent Fenton reaction, and initiating mitochondrial LPO. The destroyed mitochondrial membrane potential, disturbed mitochondrial fusion and fission, as well as downregulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase mutually contribute to mitochondrial LPO. Consequently, OART enhances tumor immunogenicity by releasing damage associated molecular patterns and promoting antigen presenting cells maturation, thereby transforming tumor environment from immunosuppressive to immunosensitive. By establishing in vivo model of tumorigenesis and lung metastasis, we verified that OART improves the systematic immune response. In summary, OART has enormous clinical potential for ferroptosis-based cancer therapy in translational medicine.",['Fan R; Deng A; Lin R; Zhang S; Cheng C; Zhuang J; Hai Y; Zhao M; Yang L; Wei G'],2024,ferroptosis inducer oxaliplatin-artesunate exhibits bioactivity in vitro and vivo. oxaliplatin-artesunate induces cytoplasmic and mitochondrial LPO. oxaliplatin-artesunate induces cytoplasmic and mitochondrial LPO.
Clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with drug-coated balloon treatment for femoropopliteal artery disease in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.,"The effect of drug-coated balloons (DCB) on hemodialysis (HD) in patients with femoropopliteal (FP) disease remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of DCB therapy in patients with FP artery disease on HD. A total of 185 patients with FP lesions (140 HD patients) who underwent DCB treatment were included in the study. The incidence of restenosis and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months were measured. Risk factors for TLR were also investigated. The mean age was 71.7 years, and diabetes was observed in 82.3% of patients. The mean duration of receiving dialysis was 8.8 years. The mean lesion length was 11.0 cm, and approximately half of the lesions were severely calcified. Severe dissection after DCB therapy was observed in 19.5% of patients. During the follow-up period, 74 restenosis, 68 TLRs, 8 major amputations, and 28 deaths were observed. The freedom rates from restenosis and TLR at 12 months were 63.8% and 71.3%, respectively. The freedom rates after low- and high-dose DCB at 12 months were 61.9% and 70.6% for restenosis (P = 0.49) and 66.4% and 79.4% for TLR (P = 0.095), respectively. Independent risk factors for TLR at 12 months of age were diabetes, chronic limb-threatening ischemia, and severe calcification. When patients were divided into four groups according to the number of these three risk factors, the rates of freedom from TLR at 12 months were 100%, 94.8%, 76.7%, and 30.3% in the groups with no risk factors, any one risk factor, any two risk factors, and all risk factors, respectively (P < 0.0001). Clinical outcomes after endovascular therapy in HD patients with FP disease remain unsatisfactory, even if they are treated with DCB.

Digital phantom versus patient-specific radiation dosimetry in adult routine thorax CT examinations.,"The aim of this study was to compare the organ doses assessed through a digital phantom-based and a patient specific-based dosimetric tool in adult routine thorax computed tomography (CT) examinations with reference to physical dose measurements performed in anthropomorphic phantoms. Two Monte Carlo based dose calculation tools were used to assess organ doses in routine adult thorax CT examinations. These were a digital phantom-based dosimetry tool (NCICT, National Cancer Institute, USA) and a patient-specific individualized dosimetry tool (ImpactMC, CT Imaging GmbH, Germany). Digital phantoms and patients were classified in four groups according to their water equivalent diameter (D<sub>w</sub>). Normalized to volume computed tomography dose index (CTDI<sub>vol</sub>), organ dose was assessed for lungs, esophagus, heart, breast, active bone marrow, and skin. Organ doses were compared to measurements performed using thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) in two physical anthropomorphic phantoms that simulate the average adult individual as a male (Alderson Research Labs, USA) and as a female (ATOM Phantoms, USA). The average percent difference of NCICT to TLD and ImpactMC to TLD dose measurements across all organs in both sexes was 13% and 6%, respectively. The average ± 1 standard deviation in dose values across all organs with NCICT, ImpactMC, and TLDs was ± 0.06 (mGy/mGy), ± 0.19 (mGy/mGy), and ± 0.13 (mGy/mGy), respectively. Organ doses decreased with increasing D<sub>w</sub> in both NCICT and ImpactMC. Organ doses estimated with ImpactMC were in closer agreement to TLDs compared to NCICT. This may be attributed to the inherent property of ImpactMC methodology to generate phantoms that resemble the realistic anatomy of the examined patient as opposed to NCICT methodology that incorporates an anatomical discrepancy between phantoms and patients.",['Papadakis AE; Giannakaki V; Stratakis J; Myronakis M; Zaidi H; Damilakis J'],2024,two Monte Carlo based dose calculation tools were used to assess organ doses in adult thorax computed tomography (CT) examinations. the results were compared to measurements performed using thermoluminescent detectors (TLDs) in two physical anthropomorphic phantoms.
Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with distinct folate-related metabolites in early and mid-pregnancy: A prospective cohort study.,"This study aimed to evaluate the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and circulating folate metabolites, folic acid (FA) intake, and the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) genotype. A prospective pregnancy cohort study was conducted in Beijing, China, from 2022 to 2023. Circulating folate metabolites, including red blood cell (RBC) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), 5, 10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF), 5- formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF), and unmetabolised folic acid (UMFA), and plasma homocysteine (HCY), 5-MTHF, and methylmalonic acid (MMA), were determined at 6-17 weeks and 20-26 weeks of gestation. FA intake and the MTHFR and MTRR genotype were also examined. GDM was diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The association between the folate status and GDM was ascertained using multivariate generalised linear models, logistic regression models, and restricted cubic spline regression, adjusting for potential confounders. The study included 2032 pregnant women, of whom 392 (19.29%) developed GDM. UMFA above the 75th percentile (≥P75) [adjusted OR (aOR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 1.36 (1.01-1.84)], UMFA ≥ P90 [aOR (95% CI) = 1.82 (1.23-2.69)], and HCY ≥ P75 [aOR (95% CI) = 1.40 (1.04-1.88)] in early pregnancy, and RBC 5-MTHF [aOR (95% CI) = 1.48 (1.10-2.00)], RBC 5,10-CH2-THF [aOR (95% CI) = 1.55 (1.15-2.10)], and plasma 5-MTHF [aOR (95% CI) = 1.36 (1.00-1.86)] in mid-pregnancy ≥ P75 are associated with GDM. Higher UMFA levels in early pregnancy show positive associations with the 1-h and 2-h glucose levels during the OGTT, and higher HCY levels are associated with increased fasting glucose levels during the OGTT. In comparison, RBC 5- MTHF and 5,10-CH2-THF, and plasma 5- MTHF in mid-pregnancy are positively associated with the 1-h glucose level (p < 0.05). The MTHFR and MTRR genotype and FA intake are not associated with GDM. Elevated levels of UMFA and HCY during early pregnancy, along with elevated RBC 5-MTHF and 5,10-CH2-THF and plasma 5-MTHF during mid-pregnancy, are associated with GDM. These findings indicate distinct connections between different folate metabolites and the occurrence of GDM.",['Zheng W; Zhang Y; Zhang P; Chen T; Yan X; Li L; Shao L; Song Z; Han W; Wang J; Huang J; Ma K; Yang R; Ma Y; Xu L; Zhang K; Yuan X; Li G'],2024,"a prospective pregnancy cohort study was conducted in china, 2022 to 2023. circulating folate metabolites, including red blood cell, were examined.

Type 2 diabetes mediates the causal relationship between obesity and osteomyelitis: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was used to determine the causal relationship between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and osteomyelitis (OM). We performed MR analysis using pooled data from different large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Instrumental variables were selected based on genome-wide significance, instrumental strength was assessed using F-values, and thresholds for the number of exposed phenotypes were further adjusted by Bonferroni correction. univariable and multivariable MR analyses were performed to assess causal effects and proportions mediated by T2D. IVW (inverse variance weighting) showed a significant genetic effect of osteomyelitis on the following: After correction by Bonferroni, univariable analyses showed that childhood body mass index (BMI) was not significantly associated with genetic susceptibility to OM [odds ratio (OR), 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02, 1.55; P = .030], not significantly associated with adulthood BMI (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.61; P = .034), significantly associated with waist circumference (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.51, 2.24; P < .001), and significantly associated with hip circumference (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.31, 1.76; P < .001). Meanwhile, multivariable analyses showed no significant effect of childhood BMI on OM (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.84, 1.62; P = .370), no significant effect of adulthood BMI on OM (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21, 0.84; P = .015), a significant association between waist circumference and OM (OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 1.89, 9.82; P = .001), T2D mediated 10% (95% CI, 0.02, 0.14), and no significant association between hip circumference and OM (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.54, 1.90; P = .968). Our study provides evidence for a genetically predicted causal relationship among obesity, T2D, and OM. We demonstrate that increased waist circumference is positively associated with an increased risk of OM and that T2D mediates this relationship. Clinicians should be more cautious in the perioperative management of osteomyelitis surgery in obese patients with T2D. In addition, waist circumference may be a more important criterion to emphasize and strictly control than other measures of obesity.",['Liu HZ; Liang J; Hu AX'],2024,mendelian randomization analysis was used to determine the causal relationship between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and osteomyelitis (OM).

Characterization of the gut microbiota in polycystic ovary syndrome with dyslipidemia.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females which can cause many complications, such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. The metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. However, the correlation between the gut microbial community and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated. Our study elucidated the different gut microbiota in patients with PCOS and dyslipidemia (PCOS.D) compared to those with only PCOS and healthy women. In total, 18 patients with PCOS, 16 healthy females, and 18 patients with PCOS.D were enrolled. The 16 S rRNA sequencing in V3-V4 region was utilized for identifying the gut microbiota, which analyzes species annotation, community diversity, and community functions. Our results showed that the β diversity of gut microbiota did not differ significantly among the three groups. Regarding gut microbiota dysbiosis, patients with PCOS showed a decreased abundance of Proteobacteria, and patients with PCOS.D showed an increased abundance of Bacteroidota compared to other groups. With respect to the gut microbial imbalance at genus level, the PCOS.D group showed a higher abundance of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 compared to other two groups. Furthermore, the abundances of Faecalibacterium and Holdemanella were lower in the PCOS.D than those in the PCOS group. Several genera, including Faecalibacterium and Holdemanella, were negatively correlated with the lipid profiles. Pseudomonas was negatively correlated with luteinizing hormone levels. Using PICRUSt analysis, the gut microbiota community functions suggested that certain metabolic pathways (e.g., amino acids, glycolysis, and lipid) were altered in PCOS.D patients as compared to those in PCOS patients. The gut microbiota characterizations in patients with PCOS.D differ from those in patients with PCOS and controls, and those might also be related to clinical parameters. This may have the potential to become an alternative therapy to regulate the clinical lipid levels of patients with PCOS in the future.",['Yang T; Li G; Xu Y; He X; Song B; Cao Y'],2024,polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrinopathy in childbearing-age females. the metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS were linked to gut microbial dysbiosis. the correlation between the gut microbiota and dyslipidemia in PCOS remains unillustrated.
Dietary seafood as a potential modifier in the relationship between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) burden and prediabetes/diabetes: Insights from a nationally representative cross-sectional study.,"While seafood is recognized for its beneficial effects on glycemic control, concerns over elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may deter individuals from its consumption. This study aims to elucidate the relationship between seafood intake, PFASs exposure, and the odds of diabetes. Drawing from the China National Human Biomonitoring data (2017-2018), we assessed the impact of PFASs on the prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes across 10851 adults, including 5253 individuals (48.1%) reporting seafood consumption. Notably, seafood consumers exhibited PFASs levels nearly double those of non-consumers. Multinomial logistic regression identified significant positive associations between serum PFASs concentrations and prediabetes (T<sub>3</sub> vs. T<sub>1</sub>: OR<sub>PFOA</sub>: 1.64 [1.08-2.49], OR<sub>PFNA</sub>: 1.59 [1.19-2.13], OR<sub>PFDA</sub>: 1.56 [1.13-2.17], OR<sub>PFHxS</sub>: 1.58 [1.18-2.12], OR<sub>PFHpS</sub>: 1.73 [1.24-2.43], OR<sub>PFOS</sub>: 1.51 [1.15-1.96], OR<sub>6:2 Cl-PFESA</sub>: 1.58 [1.21-2.07]). Significant positive association were also found between PFHpS, PFOS, and diabetes. RCS curves indicated significant non-linear relationships between log-transformed PFOA, PFUnDA, PFOS, 6:2 Cl-PFESA, and FBG levels. Subgroup analyses revealed that seafood consumption significantly mitigated the associations between PFASs burdens and prediabetes/diabetes. These findings suggest a protective role of dietary seafood against the adverse effects of PFASs exposure on glycemic disorders, offering insights for dietary interventions aimed at mitigating diabetes risks associated with PFASs.",['Qu Y; Sheng N; Ji S; Li Z; Wang J; Pan Y; Hu X; Zheng X; Li Y; Song H; Xie L; Zhang W; Cai J; Zhao F; Zhu Y; Cao Z; Lv Y; Dai J; Shi X'],2024,"study aims to elucidate the relationship between seafood intake, PFASs exposure, and the odds of diabetes.

Glomerular crescents are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetic kidney disease progression: a retrospective cohort study.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) stands as the predominant cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. Its diverse range of manifestations complicates the treatment approach for patients. Although kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. Herein, we addressed whether the presence of glomerular crescents is linked to the outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD. We performed a retrospective evaluation, involving 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed DKD in the context of type 2 diabetes, excluding cases with other glomerular diseases, from nine tertiary hospitals. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox regression model to assess the risk of kidney disease progression, defined as either ≥ 50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rates or the development of end-stage kidney disease, based on the presence of glomerular crescents. Out of the 327 patients selected, ten patients had glomerular crescents observed in their biopsied tissues. Over the follow-up period (median of 19 months, with a maximum of 18 years), the crescent group exhibited a higher risk of kidney disease progression than the no crescent group, with an adjusted HR of 2.82 (1.32-6.06) (P = 0.008). The presence of heavy proteinuria was associated with an increased risk of developing glomerular crescents. The presence of glomerular crescents is indeed linked to the progression of type 2 DKD. Therefore, it is important to determine whether there is an additional immune-mediated glomerulonephritis requiring immunomodulation, and it may be prudent to monitor the histology and repeat a biopsy.",['Bae S; Yun D; Lee SW; Jhee JH; Lee JP; Chang TI; Oh J; Kwon YJ; Kim SG; Lee H; Kim DK; Joo KW; Moon KC; Chin HJ; Han SS'],2024,kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. but it lacks precision in predicting the progression of kidney dysfunction. 327 patients diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed type 2 DKD.
Prognostic factors and clinical features of rhino-orbital-mucormycosis cases: an update for patient and visual survivals.,"To determine the frequency of patients' vision survival and prognostic factors and evaluate clinical features in rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Forty-three eyes of 43 patients followed up with orbital mucormycosis infections were included in the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients, symptoms at admission, ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic examination findings, clinical findings during follow-up, medical and surgical procedures, and complications were recorded. Patient survival was determined by assessing the incidence of mortality, and vision survival was defined as achieving a final visual acuity of at least light perception. Twenty-seven (62.8%) patients were male, and 16 (37.2%) were female. When the underlying disease status of the patients was examined, it was observed that all patients had an underlying disease and diabetes constituted the majority (65.2%). Periorbital swelling (69.8%) and ophthalmoplegia (53.5%) were the most common symptoms and findings at the admission of patients with mucormycosis infection. The disease resulted in death in 22 (51.2%) patients. The presence of fever and shorter duration of antifungal therapy were associated with lower patient survival. Exenteration surgery was not found to be associated with the survival of the patients. Frozen eye, loss of pupillary light reflex, and development of central retinal artery occlusion were associated with lower vision survival. This study presents one of the most extensive patient series in the literature on rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Knowing the patients' symptoms at the time of admission and the clinical findings during the infection process will increase awareness about the disease.",['Aksoy M; Ozcan AA; Ulas B'],2024,"43 patients followed up with orbital mucormycosis infections were included in the study. demographic characteristics of the patients, symptoms at admission, ophthalmologic and non-ophthalmologic examination findings, clinical findings during follow-up, medical and surgical procedures."
"Trends, Sociodemographic and Hospital-Level Factors Associated with Palliative Care Utilization Among Metastatic Prostate Cancer Patients.","<b>Background:</b> Several factors are reported to be associated with palliative care utilization among patients with various cancers, but literature is lacking on metastatic prostate cancer (MPC) specific factors. Early integration of palliative care in management of MPC patients could increase their quality of life and overall outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective longitudinal analyses were conducted using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data (2010 - 2019). Prevalence trends in palliative care utilization were assessed, and sociodemographic and hospital-level factors associated with palliative care utilization in MPC patients were examined. <b>Results:</b> The overall prevalence of palliative care utilization was 13.1% with an increasing trend from 8490 to 15,231 per 100,000 MPC admissions (p-trend <.001). MPC patients aged 65 years and above had similar odds of receiving palliative care compared to younger patients. Relative to non-Hispanic Whites, other racial groups had similar likelihood to utilize palliative care services. Patients in higher median household national income quartiles had greater odds of utilizing palliative care relative to those in the first income quartile. Patients on Medicaid, private insurance and other insurance types had greater odds of palliative care use in comparison to those on Medicare. Other factors identified were hospital region, location and teaching status, patient disposition, admission type, length of stay, and number of comorbidities. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings underscore the significance of enhanced government policies and institutional support in improving palliative care use among hospitalized MPC patients. Health systems must be proactive in addressing barriers to optimization of palliative care utilization in this population.",['Olafimihan A; Jackson I; Nwachukwu C; Ozogbo S; Oh Y; George L; Fawehinmi P; Abdullahi A; Mullane M'],2024,literature is lacking on metastatic prostate cancer specific factors. early integration of palliative care in management of MPC patients could increase quality of life and overall outcomes.
Comparison of Performance in Diagnosis and Characterization of Breast Lesions: Contrast-Enhanced Mammography Versus Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,"In contemporary medical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive modality for detecting breast cancer. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM), a relatively recent technology, represents another contrast-enhanced imaging technique that has the potential to serve as an alternative to breast MRI. Our main goal is to compare the diagnostic accuracy including assessment of sensitivity and specificity of these 2 contrast-enhanced breast imaging methods, CEM and MRI, in the diagnosis and characterization of breast lesions. Our prospective study included patients who were clinically suspected of malignancy and/or had suspicious findings detected by mammography or ultrasound. A total of 116 patients were included, and both CEM and MRI examinations were performed on all patients. All CEM examinations were conducted at our institution, while 56.89% of all MRI examinations were carried out at external centers. While histopathological results were accessible for all malignant lesions, the final diagnosis for 80.5% of benign lesions was established through typical imaging findings and adequate follow-up. This study encompassed a total of 219 lesions, with 125 out of 219 (57.07%) malignant lesions and 94 out of 219 (42.92%) benign lesions. The sensitivity and specificity values were 98.40% and 81.91%, respectively, for CEM, and 100% and 75.33%, respectively, for MRI. Moreover, CEM showcased comparable performance to MRI in evaluating women with dense breasts.

"RUNX1-induced upregulation of PTGS2 enhances cell growth, migration and invasion in colorectal cancer cells.","Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises via the progressive accumulation of dysregulation in key genes including oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2, also called COX2) acts as an oncogenic driver in CRC. Here, we explored the upstream transcription factors (TFs) responsible for elevating PTGS2 expression in CRC cells. The results showed that PTGS2 silencing repressed cell growth, migration and invasion in HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells. The two fragments (499-981 bp) and (1053-1434 bp) were confirmed as the core TF binding profiles of the PTGS2 promoter. PTGS2 expression positively correlated with RUNX1 level in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) samples using the TCGA-COAD dataset. Furthermore, RUNX1 acted as a positive regulator of PTGS2 expression by promoting transcriptional activation of the PTGS2 promoter via the 1086-1096 bp binding motif. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that PTGS2 upregulation induced by the TF RUNX1 promotes CRC cell growth, migration and invasion, providing an increased rationale for the use of PTGS2 inhibitors in CRC prevention and treatment.",['Zheng W; Guo Y; Kahar A; Bai J; Zhu Q; Huang X; Li Y; Xu B; Jia X; Wu G; Zhang C; Zhu Y'],2024,"PTGS2 promotes repressed cell growth, migration and invasion.

Biomaterials for immunomodulation in wound healing.,"The substantial economic impact of non-healing wounds, scarring, and burns stemming from skin injuries is evident, resulting in a financial burden on both patients and the healthcare system. This review paper provides an overview of the skin's vital role in guarding against various environmental challenges as the body's largest protective organ and associated developments in biomaterials for wound healing. We first introduce the composition of skin tissue and the intricate processes of wound healing, with special attention to the crucial role of immunomodulation in both acute and chronic wounds. This highlights how the imbalance in the immune response, particularly in chronic wounds associated with underlying health conditions such as diabetes and immunosuppression, hinders normal healing stages. Then, this review distinguishes between traditional wound-healing strategies that create an optimal microenvironment and recent peptide-based biomaterials that modulate cellular processes and immune responses to facilitate wound closure. Additionally, we highlight the importance of considering the stages of wounds in the healing process. By integrating advanced materials engineering with an in-depth understanding of wound biology, this approach holds promise for reshaping the field of wound management and ultimately offering improved outcomes for patients with acute and chronic wounds.",['Wang Y; Vizely K; Li CY; Shen K; Shakeri A; Khosravi R; Smith JR; Alteza EAII; Zhao Y; Radisic M'],2024,the skin's vital role in protecting against various environmental challenges is evident. we introduce the composition of skin tissue and the intricate processes of wound healing. this review distinguishes between traditional wound-healing strategies that create an optimal microenvironment and recent peptide-based biomaterials that modulate cellular processes and immune responses to facilitate wound closure.
A Self-supervised Learning-Based Fine-Grained Classification Model for Distinguishing Malignant From Benign Subcentimeter Solid Pulmonary Nodules.,"Diagnosing subcentimeter solid pulmonary nodules (SSPNs) remains challenging in clinical practice. Deep learning may perform better than conventional methods in differentiating benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. This study aimed to develop and validate a model for differentiating malignant and benign SSPNs using CT images. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with SSPNs detected between January 2015 and October 2021 as an internal dataset. Malignancy was confirmed pathologically; benignity was confirmed pathologically or via follow-up evaluations. The SSPNs were segmented manually. A self-supervision pre-training-based fine-grained network was developed for predicting SSPN malignancy. The pre-trained model was established using data from the National Lung Screening Trial, Lung Nodule Analysis 2016, and a database of 5478 pulmonary nodules from the previous study, with subsequent fine-tuning using the internal dataset. The model's efficacy was investigated using an external cohort from another center, and its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined. Overall, 1276 patients (mean age, 56 ± 10 years; 497 males) with 1389 SSPNs (mean diameter, 7.5 ± 2.0 mm; 625 benign) were enrolled. The internal dataset was specifically enriched for malignancy. The model's performance in the internal testing set (316 SSPNs) was: AUC, 0.964 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.942-0.986); accuracy, 0.934; sensitivity, 0.965; and specificity, 0.908. The model's performance in the external test set (202 SSPNs) was: AUC, 0.945 (95% CI: 0.910-0.979); accuracy, 0.911; sensitivity, 0.977; and specificity, 0.860.

Glycemic Management in Insulin-Naive Patients in the Inpatient Setting.,"The ideal inpatient insulin regimen efficiently attains the target blood glucose range, effectively treats hyperglycemia, and minimizes the risk of hypoglycemia. The objective of this study was to compare glycemic targets achieved by using correctional monotherapy (CM) and basal-bolus therapy (BBT) in insulin-naive patients in the inpatient setting to determine optimal blood glucose management for these patients. This was a retrospective observational cohort study of 792 patients with diabetes not on home insulin therapy who were admitted to an academic hospital over a 5.5-month period. The percentages of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic values in each group were compared. Among the 3,112 measured blood glucose values obtained from 792 patients within the first 24 hours of insulin administration, 28.5% were hyperglycemic in the BBT group compared with 23.5% in the CM group. When adjusted for covariates, there was a 23% decrease in hyperglycemia in the BBT group (incidence rate ratio = 0.77, 95% CI 0.64-0.95, <i>P</i> = 0.006). Increases in A1C and admission blood glucose, as well as decreases in admission creatinine and inpatient steroid use, were independently associated with higher rates of hyperglycemia, adjusted for all other covariates. There was no significant difference between the groups in the rate of hypoglycemia in the first 24 hours, which was 1.9% in the BBT group and 1.4% in the CM group (<i>P</i> = 0.301).

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome in Cancer Cases: Current Knowledge and Perspectives.,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disabling painful disorder caused by many different and poorly understood mechanisms. It often affects the distal limbs and usually happens as consequence of a trauma. Its severity can remarkably affect patients' quality of life. When this painful complication happens in a cancer patient, the impact may be exponential. To date, there is limited knowledge of the surrounding circumstances of CRPS cases in this population. We present two clinical cases of patients diagnosed with cancer-related pain presenting with symptoms and signs compatible with CRPS. In one case, CRPS was attributed to direct tumor nerve compression, and it responded successfully to an interventional pain procedure. The second case was associated with a Zoster infection in an immunocompromised cancer patient. Patient responded to multidisciplinary pain management strategies. Additionally, we conducted a literature review to investigate the coexistence of cancer pain and CRPS and suggest some pathophysiology mechanisms of action. Literature reviewed and potential pathophysiology mechanisms are simultaneously explored in terms of classification, etiopathology, evidence, challenges, and future scientific directions. Comorbid CRPS can impact negatively in cases of cancer pain by affecting their diagnosis and treatment. Further studies are necessary to elucidate how these two conditions present together and how they can be better addressed.",['Thanaboriboon C; Matos Macêdo MC; Perez J'],2024,complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a disabling painful disorder. it can affect the distal limbs and usually happens as consequence of a trauma. it can affect patients' quality of life.

To pinpoint errors in OS differentiation, we transcriptionally profiled 31,527 cells from a tissue-engineered model that directsMSCs toward adipogenic and osteoblastic fates. Incorporating pre-existing chondrocyte data, we applied trajectory analysis and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to generate the first human mesenchymal differentiation atlas. This 'roadmap' served as a reference to delineate the cellular composition of morphologically complex OS tumors and quantify each cell's lineage commitment.

Poor Glycemic Control Affecting Screening of Prostate Carcinoma.,"Introduction Diabetes and cancer are commonly linked together. The possible links include insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. These are factors that have potential promoting effects on the progression of cancer in many ways. Measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is widely applied for early detection of prostate cancer. However, several factors influence serum PSA levels in men including age, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis, and body mass index (BMI). The risk of several malignancies is increased in diabetes but the risk of prostate carcinoma in diabetic patients is reduced secondary to lowering of testosterone levels during the state of hyperinsulinemia. A negative association between serum PSA levels and metformin use is also an explanation of low cancer prostate incidence with diabetes. Objective The study aims to evaluate the PSA levels in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control i.e., glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 7%) vs good glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%). Materials and methods Samples of PSA in diabetic patients collected in the Department of Biochemistry at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna, were included. The observational study was carried out on clinically diagnosed 318 cases of diabetes attending both the outpatient and inpatient Department, IGIMS, Patna. Six ml venous blood samples were collected from patients after obtaining informed consent and ethical clearance. Patient details regarding age, complete clinical details, and general physical examinations were recorded. Serum levels of PSA, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c were analyzed and values were compared. The serum level of PSA was estimated by the chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) method on an automated immunoassay analyzer in the Department of Biochemistry, maintaining all the quality control precautions using a control, calibrator, and reagent kit. HbA1c estimation was by chromatography technique. Fasting plasma glucose was estimated using the hexokinase method on an automated chemistry analyzer. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago). The median and interquartile range were calculated for numerical variables. Covariance analysis was used in the comparisons among groups. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied to detect the comparison between the two groups. Significance was determined by the P value. P value<0.05 was considered significant. Result Serum PSA value was found to be higher in (the good glycemic control group) with a median of 0.99 with an interquartile range of 3.14, than in (the bad glycemic control group) with a median of 0.49 with an interquartile range of 3.9, and the difference is statistically significant. The difference is also statistically significant in the subgroup (i) with PSA value <4 ng/ml. In subgroups (ii) and (iii), PSA values 4 ng/ml-8 ng/ml and PSA values >8 ng/ml respectively, no significant differences were found. Conclusion It was found that serum prostate-specific antigen levels have been lower in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control than in good glycemic control.

The C-terminal disordered loop domain of Apc8 unlocks APC/C mitotic activation.,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a critical and tightly regulated E3 ligase that orchestrates the cellular life cycle by controlling the degradation of cell cycle regulators. An intriguing feature of this complex is an autoinhibition mechanism: an intrinsically disordered loop domain, Apc1-300L, blocks Cdc20 coactivator binding, yet phosphorylation of Apc1-300L counteracts this autoinhibition. Many such disordered loops within APC/C remain unexplored. Our systematic analysis of loop-deficient APC/C mutants uncovered a pivotal role for Apc8's C-terminal loop (Apc8-L) in mitotic activation. Apc8-L directly recruits the CDK adaptor protein, Xe-p9/Cks2, positioning the Xe-p9-CDK-CycB complex near Apc1-300L. This stimulates the phosphorylation and removal of Apc1-300L, prompting the formation of active APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup>. Strikingly, without both Apc8-L and Apc3-L, the APC/C is rendered inactive during mitosis, highlighting Apc8-L's synergistic role with other loops and kinases. This study broadens our understanding of the intricate dynamics in APC/C regulation and provides insights on the regulation of macromolecular complexes.",['Darling S; Fujimitsu K; Chia KH; Zou J; Rappsilber J; Yamano H'],2024,"anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a critical and tightly regulated E3 ligase that orchestrates the cellular life cycle by controlling the degradation of cell cycle regulators. an intrinsically disordered loop domain, Apc1-300L, blocks Cdc20 coactivator binding, yet phosphorylation of Apc1-300L counteracts this autoinhibition."
Breaking down barriers to bariatric care: a qualitative study on how telemedicine could transform patient experiences in a Swiss monocentric setting.,"Telemedicine is becoming an increasingly feasible option for patients with chronic diseases due to its convenience, cost-effectiveness and ease of access. While there are certain limitations, the benefits can be appreciated by those seeking repetitive care. The perception of telemedicine as an alternative to recurrent, in-person appointments for patients with obesity in structured bariatric programmes is still unclear. This content analysis' primary endpoint was to explore how patients within our bariatric programme perceived telemedicine and virtual consultations as a new way of communication during COVID-19. A qualitative study using semistructured interviews and qualitative content analysis method by Elo and Kyngäs following four steps: data familiarisation, coding and categorising with Quirkos software and final interpretation guided by developed categories. University Hospital, Switzerland. We conducted 33 interviews with 19 patients from a structured bariatric programme. Most patients shared positive experiences, acknowledging the convenience and accessibility of virtual appointments. Others voiced concerns, especially regarding telemedicine's limitations. These reservations centred around the lack of physical examinations, difficulties in fostering connections with healthcare providers, as well as barriers stemming from language and technology.
